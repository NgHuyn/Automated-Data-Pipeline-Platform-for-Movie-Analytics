       "    'Review': 'I\\'m so irritated. \"Joker\" was a gritty, intense psychological thriller that explored complex themes of mental illness and societal breakdown. It was a raw, dark film that didn\\'t need gimmicks or unnecessary changes to make a statement. So WHY in the world would anyone think it\\'s a good idea to turn \"Joker 2\" into a musical?This is a slap in the face to fans of the original. We didn\\'t ask for dancing and singing - we wanted more of the same unsettling atmosphere, not a Broadway-style number in the middle of Gotham\\'s madness. I signed up for a continuation of Arthur Fleck\\'s descent into chaos, not a flashy musical break that completely destroys the tone.The first \"Joker\" was a masterpiece. This sequel choice feels like a desperate attempt to be \"different\" without respecting the core of what made the character and story so compelling. Ridiculous decision.',\n",

It lost the entire spirit and message of the first one.The first hour was next to pointless and felt like a long, strung out, snoozefest. The second half had a spark of something acceptable, but that dumpster quickly caught fire again and led to one of the worst endings imaginable. Cutting the awful music would\\'ve saved 45 minutes of movie.If the goal was to make a bad movie, it would win film of the year and I swear I gave it to the last frame to be good, but it just fell flat on its face. I\\'m going to pretend it was never made, and that I didn\\'t waste two hours of my life on this. If you actually want to watch this, wait until it\\'s free.If I were to say one thing positive, it did have ONE good song and sequence to accompany it, \"Every Deck Has a Joker, and That Joker Is Me\".Moral of the story is, I\\'m never going to watch this again.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux was a huge disappointment. The movie failed to capture the essence of the Joker character, feeling more like a hollow follow-up than a meaningful sequel. Harley Quinn's introduction brought no impact or depth, and her presence felt unnecessary rather than complementary. The story lacked the intensity and psychological complexity that made the first Joker film so compelling. Honestly, it didn't feel like a Joker film at all !!! It should have been titled something else because it didn't represent what fans expect from the Joker universe... I'm sure lots of people will leave the movie from the half because the story is not moving forward at all !!\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'It seems as if the audience is being punished for enjoying, celebrating and supporting JOKER 2019. This sequel was a disrespectful and malicious take on the Joker. The movie was mainly divided into three parts being prison, courtroom and musical all of which robs the Joker of any personal agency. At no point did we get a display of the criminal mastermind, psychopath with a warped, sadistic sense of humor that are staple characteristics of a the villain we have come to know and love. Furthermore, there is an added frustration because the level of financial investment, production and quality acting is evident. If you have any affinity with previous versions of the Joker this movie will annoy and aggravate you. I recommend that you save your time and money.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker Folie a Deux... Or just Joker 2 for normal people, is a completely unneeded sequel, that got made by Todd Phillips.He decided to shred and spit on his original, praised movie, to cut himself away from the \"toxicity of Joker\".Joker in this movie goes back to miserable Arthur Fleck, who is emasculated, ridiculed and humiliated for most of the movie. He has no agency in his movie, he is just there as the events take place around him, and when he finally gets his moment it just ends with one of the dumbest decisions he could\\'ve made.The ending is the ultimate end to Joker franchise by Todd Phillips, like he wanted to make a statement about his first movie and to be perfectly sure nobody in WB will ever ask him to make another one.Movie is a boring slog, with no story, no character development, musical scenes being just there out of nowhere - just because we have Lady Gaga on screen, who is a good actress by the way, but almost everything involving Gaga is a musical, and she gets no way to actually act.Todd Phillips already showed us that he is bad at sequels with The Hangover movies - but still there was some enjoyment to be had with 2 and 3... and especially with 2.This is an insult to the fans, to the Joker and to the cast who tried their best with the crappy material they were given.

It's a crushing letdown, and honestly, it's even more underwhelming than Coppola's Megalopolis this year. I was hyped for this film, but it failed to deliver on nearly every level. Warner Bros. Needs to take a hard look at their creative control over their hit movies, because this sequel is a straight-up embarrassment. It's like they took everything that made the original great and threw it out the window.I'm genuinely sad to see a beloved character and story fall so far from its former glory. This franchise deserved better, and the fans deserved more. The plot was a mess, the characters were paper-thin, and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. I'm still wondering how a film with so much potential could go so wrong. I hope the studio takes this as a wake-up call and goes back to the drawing board to figure out what made the original film so great in the first place.Right now, I'm just left feeling disappointed and frustrated. This sequel was a waste of potential, and it's a reminder that sometimes, it's better to leave well enough alone rather than trying to revive something that's best left in the past.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"The original Joker was a dark, gritty exploration of mental illness and societal decay. It was a critical and commercial success, leaving audiences stunned and disturbed. However, its sequel, Joker: Folie à Deux, is a disappointing departure from the original's success. The decision to turn the film into a musical was a baffling one that completely undermines the tone and themes established in the first film.The musical numbers in Joker: Folie à Deux feel forced and out of place. They disrupt the narrative and detract from the film's overall atmosphere. The songs are often generic and forgettable, failing to add anything meaningful to the story. Additionally, the musical style clashes with the film's dark subject matter, creating a jarring dissonance that is difficult to ignore.Beyond the musical elements, Joker: Folie à Deux suffers from a lack of compelling storytelling. The plot is predictable and the characters are underdeveloped. The film fails to capture the same intensity and emotional depth as its predecessor. The pacing is slow and the dialogue is often clunky and contrived.The ending of the film is particularly disappointing. It feels rushed and unsatisfying, leaving many questions unanswered. The conclusion is a far cry from the shocking and thought-provoking ending of the original film. It is a letdown that leaves the viewer feeling cheated and unsatisfied.In conclusion, Joker: Folie à Deux is a significant disappointment. The decision to turn the film into a musical was a major miscalculation that undermines the film's tone and themes. The storytelling is weak, the characters are underdeveloped, and the ending is unsatisfying. Fans of the original film will likely be left feeling disappointed and confused by this misguided sequel.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"It's incredibly disappointing to say, but Joker 2 fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. After the phenomenal success of Joker (2019), I, like many fans, was eagerly anticipating the sequel. The first film was groundbreaking in its portrayal of mental health, societal unrest, and the psychological descent of Arthur Fleck, brought to life masterfully by Joaquin Phoenix. It was a powerful and darkly emotional story with a stunning narrative arc and visuals that lingered in the mind long after the credits rolled. Naturally, I had high expectations for Joker 2, but unfortunately, the film fell flat in nearly every aspect.To start, the plot is almost non-existent. Unlike the first movie, which had a compelling story that kept you hooked from start to finish, Joker 2 feels aimless. There's no sense of direction, and the events that unfold seem arbitrary, almost like they're there just to fill time. The narrative doesn't build up to anything meaningful or significant, and there's a lack of the emotional depth that made the original such a standout. Instead of focusing on a coherent storyline, it seems the filmmakers opted for style over substance, and that really diminishes the experience.One of the biggest issues with Joker 2 is how predictable it is. The first movie was filled with shocking twists and moments that genuinely took you by surprise, but this sequel fails to deliver on that front. You can almost see every scene coming from a mile away, and by the halfway point, the film becomes boring because you know exactly where it's heading. There's no suspense, no tension, and nothing to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. It's frustrating to sit through a movie where every plot point is telegraphed long before it happens, and that's exactly what Joker 2 does.Character development is another area where Joker 2 falls short. In the original, we witnessed Arthur Fleck's transformation into the Joker in a slow, methodical way that felt earned and organic. In this film, however, the characters seem stagnant. There's no growth or evolution, and they don't go through any significant challenges or changes that would make them interesting. Even Joaquin Phoenix's performance, which was the highlight of the first film, feels subdued and lacking in intensity this time around. It's almost as if the actor is going through the motions without the passion and commitment he had previously shown.The pacing of the film is also a major issue. It drags on, with long stretches where nothing of significance happens. Scenes feel drawn out for no reason, and the film never really builds any momentum. By the time you reach the climax, you're left feeling underwhelmed because the movie never really earns its big moments. It's difficult to stay engaged when the film keeps losing steam every few minutes, and that's something Joker 2 never manages to overcome.Overall, Joker 2 is a huge disappointment. It lacks the heart, soul, and depth of its predecessor, and instead of building on the success of the first film, it feels like a watered-down version with none of the originality or impact. The story is weak, the characters are underdeveloped, and the film is plagued by predictability and poor pacing. If you were excited about this sequel, I'd suggest tempering your expectations because, unfortunately, it falls far short of what made the first movie so special. In the end, Joker 2 is a letdown, and not worth the time or money to see in theaters.\",\n",

I'm not averse to musicals in general, only when the singing is terrible, and Joaquin Phoenix couldn't carry a tune in a basket - Gaga can only do so much, and even she is given little opportunity to shine, only occasionally belting out the tunes like we know she can.Add the fact that the plot is stupefyingly dull - part dreary prison story, part boring courtroom drama - and what you have is the sequel that no-one wanted. The themes are the same as the first film - madness, mental illness, societal collapse etc. - but the execution is so left-field as to alienate the established fan base. It's an undeniably gutsy move to make something so completely different, but there's something to be said for the old adage 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' - especially when your leading man is so musically challenged.1/10 - quite possibly the worst film of the year.N.

       "    'Review': 'If you watched the first 20 minutes of the movie, left for an hour, and then returned asking what you missed, your friend would likely say, \"Nothing.\" I\\'m not particularly fond of the first part, but at least it had something worth watching or a story to tell.However, this work is a disaster no one could have imagined. Literally nothing happens, and even the songs and performances feel incredibly dull and out of place. The acting might be relatively good, but without a script, without events, and without a true film.The shock lies in how the filmmakers convinced themselves that what they were making was a movie. The entire hall was filled with boredom, despite it being a special screening of the film. Everyone felt bored, and half the audience even fell asleep. And when we finally reached the climax and everyone was expecting something to happen... nothing did. If you asked someone to come up with the worst possible ending for this film, it still wouldn\\'t compare to the sheer absurdity of the actual ending.This film might become one of the worst in the last five years, not just because of its poor quality, but because of the downfall from a record-breaking film that was agreed upon by both critics and audiences, to a repulsive movie that\\'s hard to finish watching.',\n",

Yes, half of a Joker movie is a musical. Second, it seems like something went off the tracks during production. Either the director got mad, Lady Gaga got mad, or the studio got mad. Nothing makes sense. Nothing gets resolved. The script is all over the place. Third, this movie adds nothing to the original Joker. It is as if everyone wanted to see how to absolutely ruin this Joker franchise and did so with flying colors. Fourth, what was the point of this movie? More questions. Zero answers. The story is just confusing, boring, and put people to sleep at my showing. Fifth, the ending pushed this to a 1 for me. I had it at around a 5/10 until the last 10 minutes. Only see this movie if you got extra money to waste and want to be disappointed beyond your wildest dreams.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Seriously, who thought a musical sequel was a good idea? They ruined a perfect movie with stupid singing and dancing. It's like they forgot what made the first one great. This is a joke, not a movie.The original Joker was a dark, gritty masterpiece that explored the depths of mental illness and societal decay. The sequel, however, is a complete departure from that tone. The introduction of musical numbers feels forced and out of place, disrupting the film's narrative and destroying the atmosphere that made the first movie so compelling.The idea of turning a serious drama into a musical is a risky one that ultimately doesn't pay off. Musical films require strong songs and a well-crafted narrative to be successful. Joker 2 fails on both counts. The songs are forgettable, and the plot is weak.The performances in Joker 2 are also a mixed bag. While Joaquin Phoenix delivers a solid performance, the rest of the cast feels underwhelming. The supporting characters are one-dimensional and fail to make a lasting impression.In conclusion, Joker 2 is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. The introduction of musical elements is a significant misstep that undermines the film's narrative and tone. While the original Joker was a masterpiece, Joker 2 is a forgettable mess.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Let's cut to the chase: Joker 2 is an unholy mess-a dumpster fire wrapped in a pretentious bow. It's as if the creators decided to throw out everything that made the first film a haunting exploration of mental illness and replace it with a hollow, cliché-laden spectacle that panders to the lowest common denominator.Remember how Joker held a mirror to the darker corners of society? Well, this sequel is just a funhouse mirror, reflecting distorted caricatures of its characters while simultaneously obliterating their depth. Arthur Fleck's descent into madness was a visceral journey; here, it's just a lazy stroll through a comic book cliché.And let's talk about Harley Quinn. What happened to the brutal, chaotic love story that rocked the very foundations of their twisted relationship? Instead, we get a half-baked romance that feels more like a marketing ploy than a genuine connection. Arthur and Harley's dynamic is now as shallow as a kiddie pool, stripped of the raw emotion that made their narrative compelling.The climax? A nonsensical mess, featuring a random character who exists solely to meet a bloody end-because apparently, shocking violence is the last refuge of a lazy script. There's no coherent story arc, just a series of aimless scenes that fail to capture the essence of the original. It's as if the filmmakers threw darts at a board of plot devices and hoped for the best.The musical numbers? An auditory assault that adds nothing but further emptiness to an already vacuous experience. It's almost impressive how they managed to achieve zero emotional resonance in a film filled with song and dance.In conclusion, Joker 2 is a painful watch, a cautionary tale of what happens when studios prioritize spectacle over substance. Here's hoping the creators take a long, hard look at their choices-or, better yet, just step away from the industry entirely.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I'm really disappointed with this new direction for the 2024 Joker film. The original 'Joker' was a raw, dark exploration of mental illness and society's failings, with a tone that was unsettling and deeply impactful. It didn't rely on cheap tricks to make a point; it was grounded and gritty, which made Arthur Fleck's descent into madness feel real and haunting.So why turn the sequel into a musical? This feels like a complete disconnect from what made the first movie so powerful. Instead of continuing with the same intense atmosphere, we're bombarded with music at every turn, even in moments that should have been suspenseful or emotionally heavy. It almost feels like the filmmakers were more interested in crafting a musical experience than telling a compelling story.The constant musical interruptions destroy the tone of Gotham's chaotic underworld. It's frustrating because it feels like a decision to stand out rather than honor what made the original so memorable. A flashy musical? That's not what Joker fans signed up for. We wanted to see Arthur Fleck's journey continue, not break into song. If you don't have Spotify Premium, you can watch this movie.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"As a huge fan of the first *Joker*, I went into *Joker 2* with high expectations. The original movie was dark, intense, and told a powerful story about Arthur Fleck's descent into madness. It was gritty and had a raw energy that made it stand out from other comic book adaptations. But sadly, *Joker 2* completely misses the mark, and to be honest, it's a massive letdown.The biggest problem with *Joker 2* is that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. The original film was very focused on its message and its tone, but this sequel is all over the place. It lacks any clear direction, and I found myself constantly wondering where the movie was going. Instead of being a tight, gripping story like the first one, it feels scattered and confused.What makes things worse is the decision to turn *Joker 2* into a musical. When I first heard that this film would include musical numbers, I was worried. It's such a strange choice for a character like the Joker, and unfortunately, my fears were confirmed. The musical element doesn't fit at all with the tone of the movie. Every time the story starts to build up some tension or emotion, it gets interrupted by a random song or dance sequence. These scenes are supposed to add something unique, but instead, they end up making the movie feel silly and unfocused.It's frustrating because there are moments in *Joker 2* where you can see glimpses of what made the first movie so great. The darker, more dramatic scenes still have potential, but they're constantly undercut by these nonsensical musical numbers. It's like the film can't decide if it wants to be a serious psychological drama or a flashy musical, and as a result, it fails at both. The musical scenes turn what could have been intense moments into awkward, boring parts of the movie.Joaquin Phoenix, who was brilliant in the first movie, feels wasted here. You can tell he's still giving it his all in certain scenes, trying to bring that same depth and intensity to Arthur Fleck's character, but the film doesn't give him the room to fully explore it. Instead, he's forced into these strange, out-of-place musical sequences that take away from his performance. It's a real shame because we know Phoenix is capable of so much more, but the movie doesn't let him shine the way it did in the original.Another issue is the pacing. *Joker 2* feels both rushed and dragged out at the same time. There are parts of the movie that feel like they're rushing through important plot points without giving them the time they need to develop, and other parts that drag on forever with no real purpose. The result is a movie that feels uneven and disjointed, and it's hard to stay engaged when the story is so all over the place.What made the first *Joker* so impactful was its slow, deliberate build-up and its focus on Arthur's character development. You could feel his descent into madness, and it was hard not to get pulled into his world. *Joker 2* lacks that same emotional punch. It's missing the subtlety and the tension that made the original so powerful, and instead, it feels like a chaotic mess.There are a few redeeming qualities in the film. The cinematography is still visually striking, and there are some moments where the film manages to capture that gritty, realistic atmosphere from the first movie. The supporting cast, including Lady Gaga, delivers solid performances, but even they can't save the movie from its own confusion.In the end, *Joker 2* just doesn't live up to the first film. It's a disappointing sequel that doesn't seem to understand what made the original so great. The musical element, in particular, feels like a huge mistake, and it turns what could have been an interesting follow-up into a confusing and boring experience. Fans of the first movie will likely walk away feeling let down, wondering how a sequel could go so wrong.\",\n",

Despite Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga's involvement, their performances fall flat in a confusing narrative with erratic tonal shifts. The result is a cringeworthy sequel that fails to live up to the original's intensity. The film's attempt to blend psychological drama with romance feels forced and awkward, adding to the overall confusion. Ultimately, what could have been a gripping sequel collapses under its own disorganization. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one. Despite the hype, Joker fails to deliver anything memorable, leaving audiences frustrated rather than entertained.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"The first Joker is in my top 10 movies of all time. But this movie was a complete disappointment. Surprisingly the musical elements worked. They really did. Ignore all the review bombs about it being a musical. Because that is not the problem here. They were one of the best parts of the movie. It was enjoyable up until around the last 20 minutes. Had me thinking I was going to love this one too. But then they take the most drastic character change possible and completely destroy the character. It's like the director set out to piss in the mouth of the fans of the first movie and fans of the Joker character. There's no other way this could have been thought of. It really seems like they set out to ruin it for the fans. If you are not a fan of the first you will probably like this. This movie completely ruins everything the first did. So please, if you are a fan of the first don't ruin it for yourself by watching this :(\",\n",

The waiting time for something exciting to happen was unbearable, and the pacing made the entire film boring. I found myself on the verge of sleeping through the middle, as it failed to hold any real tension or intrigue. Many parts of the plot felt like non-sensical twists, trying too hard to be profound, but coming off as confusing and empty. Overall, it was a horrible viewing experience, lacking the brilliance of the original. I really really hate the fact I didnt left the room earlier.',\n",

In this, the second film, it's as if Arthur/joker is just being punished over and over again, to the point where the joker no longer exists and Arthur is more broken than before. Is this some kind of message to the downtrodden? Know your place, go with the narrative, do as you're told or else?I really don't understand why they chose to go in such a direction with this film.\",\n",

Sequel's are already hard to pull off with these movies, but it feels very little thought was put into the making of this movie. The ending was pointless it felt like a whole two hours focused on a court room and music. They could have thrown in some childhood throwbacks or something worth while!\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Imagine you love a certain brand of chocolate, you genuinely think it\\'s the best chocolate in the market. You wish for years the creators came up with an evolution of the chocolate, a slight variation just for fun sake\\'s. The company finally announces a new product, marketing it in the same way with the same name but just a different subtitle (Say Snickers \"Almonds\" or Snickers \"Peanut butter\" or whatever). You excitedly go to buy the product, open up the wrapper and take a first bite. You feel your face start to melt when your brain understands you\\'re not even eating a chocolate, it\\'s some sort of terrible protein bar with mint flavor and a little line of chocolate fudge on top. That is exactly how I felt about this movie.I don\\'t care who is to blame here. If Todd Philips as a director for putting out this terrible scam, or execs for forcing him to do it. Either way, the bottom line is that it is ethically wrong to take a movie that developed such a strong identity, force it to be something entirely different, and then let a massive fanbase flock to theaters to experience this heartbreaking surprise. As a fan of a the first movie, I went right back to theaters for the second one, logically expecting to see a second part of the first movie. Not a movie about lady gaga with joker as a secondary character.Cannot think of a worse scenario.',\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': 'Really bad musical',\n",
       "    'Review': 'Joker: Folie à Deux promised to be a daring, artistic exploration of the Joker and Harley Quinn\\'s twisted dynamic. Instead, it serves up a baffling misstep: a musical. Yes, you read that right-a musical that somehow manages to gut the intensity and nihilism that made the original Joker such a cultural phenomenon. And not just a musical, but a disappointing one, where the songs are as forgettable as a dropped cup of coffee on a rainy day in Gotham.First off, the music. Remember when we thought Joker was about gritty realism, descending madness, and psychological torment? Well, Folie à Deux throws that out the window in favor of ...show tunes? The songs come across as half-baked, neither catchy nor deep, with no lasting resonance. You won\\'t leave the cinema humming the tunes because, frankly, there\\'s nothing to hum. It\\'s almost like the filmmakers thought, \"Hey, what if we took all the tension and grim beauty of the original and drowned it in unremarkable piano chords and lyrics that sound like they were penned in a day?\" The result is a soundtrack that feels as relevant to Joker\\'s original film noir aesthetic as a karaoke night in Arkham Asylum.The original Joker was a gripping exploration of mental illness, social decay, and the creation of a monster-a character study with noir influences, dark alleyways, and eerie lighting that matched its protagonist\\'s crumbling psyche. It thrived in its starkness, its minimalism, and its refusal to hold your hand or sing to you about what you\\'re meant to feel. But in Folie à Deux, we get elaborate musical numbers that feel misplaced, unnecessary, and at odds with the bleakness that worked so well before. It\\'s almost like someone saw La La Land and thought, \"You know what this gritty psycho-drama needs? Jazz hands!\" Because that\\'ll totally fit, right?The songs themselves do nothing to advance the story, nor do they provide insight into the characters. This isn\\'t Les Misérables where the musical format elevates the narrative to emotional heights. No, here the musical numbers act as speed bumps, derailing any chance at building tension or atmosphere. Just when you think you\\'re about to dive back into the intense psychological drama that made the first film so compelling, bam! Here comes an awkward duet that screams \"filler\" rather than \"emotional depth.\"And let\\'s talk about the character of Harley Quinn. Sure, she\\'s always been quirky, but the way her character is introduced and utilized in Folie à Deux feels like a watered-down Broadway version of the chaotic, unpredictable force of nature she\\'s supposed to be. Instead of pushing the Joker deeper into madness, she dances along in a subplot that seems only half-interested in the descent into insanity that Joker should be. Lady Gaga\\'s performance is fine, but it\\'s hard to tell if it\\'s the casting or the musical numbers themselves that make her feel like she belongs in a different movie altogether.If you went into Joker expecting the tragic elegance of noir, the dissonance of Folie à Deux will hit you like a clown car driving through a funeral procession. The dark cinematography, the brooding score from the first film, all replaced with flashy, glitzy numbers that don\\'t know what they\\'re doing in this story. There\\'s no thematic continuity.',\n",

       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie À Deux\" is an exhausting misstep that betrays the bold spirit of its predecessor. Where the first \"Joker\" was an incisive psychological thriller, this sequel is an overstuffed, self-indulgent mess, trading subtlety for spectacle and losing sight of what made the original so compelling. The film stumbles under the weight of its own pretensions, trying desperately to be provocative but only succeeding in being hollow.The decision to make this a musical feels more like a gimmick than a thoughtful creative choice. The music sequences are jarring, out of place, and do nothing to further the narrative. Instead of enhancing the emotional landscape, they disrupt it, turning moments of potential tension into unintentionally laughable scenes. It\\'s as if the filmmakers are screaming for attention, hoping to distract the audience from the film\\'s lack of substance with over-the-top set pieces and dizzying visuals.Joaquin Phoenix, who gave a haunting, layered performance in the original, seems to be on autopilot here. His portrayal of Arthur Fleck feels more like a parody than a continuation of the character\\'s descent into madness. The film\\'s attempts to explore his psyche again are shallow, rehashing the same themes without offering any new insights. The character\\'s arc stagnates, and by the end, we\\'re left wondering if there was any real purpose to his journey this time around.Lady Gaga\\'s Harley Quinn feels equally misused. Her talent is undeniable, but the script gives her little to work with. Her character comes off as a caricature, lacking the complexity or tragic depth needed to balance Arthur\\'s madness. Instead, the film leans too heavily on their chemistry, hoping it will be enough to carry the story, but it never really gels.Visually, the film is as chaotic as its narrative. Todd Phillips seems more interested in crafting striking imagery than in telling a coherent story. The cinematography, while impressive in its ambition, often feels like style over substance. The film\\'s color palette and set design, though aesthetically bold, can\\'t hide the emptiness at its core.In trying to be a provocative commentary on society\\'s ills, \"Folie À Deux\" feels more like a desperate plea for attention, a shallow imitation of the first film\\'s more profound moments. It\\'s a sequel that misunderstands its own success, turning what was once a powerful character study into an incoherent spectacle. Rather than leaving the theater feeling unsettled or reflective, audiences are likely to walk away feeling bewildered and, worst of all, indifferent.Ultimately, \"Joker: Folie À Deux\" is a muddled and overwrought sequel that squanders the potential of its predecessor. It aims for high art but crashes under the weight of its own ambitions, delivering a film that is neither thought-provoking nor entertaining.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"I watched this movie joker that left me utterly disappointed, and I must say, it was one of the worst cinematic experiences I have ever encountered. To anyone who is a fan of good movies, I urge you to avoid this film at all costs. From start to finish, it was a disaster in almost every possible way, leaving me thoroughly unimpressed and even frustrated by how poorly executed it was.Let me begin by addressing the characterization of the joker, which, in my opinion, was one of the biggest letdowns of the entire movie. The film attempted to bring the joker character to life, but instead of capturing the essence of this iconic villain, the filmmakers turned him into a real joke, quite literally. The portrayal was so over-the-top, exaggerated, and lacking in depth that it became almost unbearable to watch. Rather than being the menacing, cunning, and psychologically complex character that fans of the genre are familiar with, the joker in this movie was reduced to a caricature. It was almost as if the filmmakers completely misunderstood the appeal of the character and decided to make a mockery of him instead.But the problems didn't stop with just the characterization. The direction of the movie was equally appalling. I've seen bad direction before, but this one took it to a whole new level. There seemed to be no coherent vision, no clear narrative direction, and no sense of pacing. The scenes were disjointed and felt like they were thrown together without much thought or purpose. There was no flow, and at times, it felt like the movie didn't know where it was going. Transitions between scenes were jarring, and instead of building tension or suspense, the film stumbled from one poorly executed scene to another, leaving the audience confused and disengaged.The acting was another major issue. It's hard to believe that talented actors were involved in this project because the performances were utterly lackluster. It felt as though the actors themselves didn't believe in the script or their characters. There was no emotional depth, no connection between the characters, and no chemistry that could have salvaged the weak plot. The lines were delivered in a way that was either too flat or overly dramatic, making it hard to take the movie seriously. It's rare to find a film where almost every performance feels phoned in, but this was one of those rare cases.The movie's beginning was another sore point. Right from the first scene, it became apparent that the film was going to be a tough watch. The start was abrupt, poorly written, and did nothing to establish the world or the characters. There was no build-up, no intrigue, and no reason to care about what was happening. It felt as though the filmmakers were trying too hard to jump straight into the action without setting up any meaningful context. This lack of a solid foundation made it difficult to become invested in the story or care about the outcome.The ending was no better. After enduring two hours of bad direction, acting, and storytelling, the film concluded with one of the worst endings I've ever seen. It was rushed, unsatisfying, and left more questions than answers. Rather than providing a resolution or tying up any loose ends, the movie just abruptly ended, leaving the audience in a state of disbelief. It was as if the filmmakers simply gave up on trying to create a coherent ending and decided to stop the movie without offering any closure.To top it all off, the dialogues in the film were atrocious. The lines were poorly written, often cringe-worthy, and lacked any sense of wit, intelligence, or emotional weight. The dialogue was so bad that it became unintentionally funny at times, which only further detracted from the movie's already weak attempt at serious storytelling.In conclusion, I would strongly advise anyone who values their time and enjoys good cinema to skip this movie altogether. It's not worth watching, even out of curiosity.\",\n",

       "    'Review': '*Joker: Folie à Deux* had high expectations to meet following the success of the first film, but unfortunately, it falls short in several areas. While Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga deliver strong performances, the movie struggles to capture the same intensity and originality that made the first *Joker* a standout.One of the main criticisms is that the sequel feels unnecessary and lacks the gripping narrative of its predecessor. The film is described as a \"dreary, underwhelming, unnecessary slog with much of the story set in Gotham\\'s Arkham Asylum and a courtroom, which fails to engage the audience as effectively as the chaotic streets of Gotham did in the first film.The decision to incorporate musical elements, while ambitious, does not pay off. Critics have noted that the musical numbers, although showcasing Lady Gaga\\'s vocal talents, feel out of place and disrupt the film\\'s tone The courtroom drama aspect is also seen as a misstep, making the movie feel more like a drawn-out legal debate rather than a thrilling psychological explorationAdditionally, the sequel lacks the same social commentary and emotional depth that resonated with audiences in the first film. While *Joker* was praised for its raw portrayal of mental illness and societal neglect, *Folie à Deux* seems to miss the mark, offering a less impactful and more superficial narrativeIn summary, *Joker: Folie à Deux* is a letdown compared to the original. Despite strong performances from its lead actors, the film\\'s disjointed narrative, misplaced musical elements, and lack of compelling storytelling make it a sequel that many fans might find disappointing.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Despite all the painful-to-watch and cringeworthy singing moments, I believe what makes this film a complete disaster is Todd Phillips\\'s failure to recognize that the Joker from the Batman series is not the character he wanted to portray. He aimed to create a film about a broken man finding his place in the world. While in the first film, many of us, at least myself, saw it as a \"set-up\" prologue, in this second installment, it is evident that it wasn\\'t. The character he wanted to flesh out has nothing to do with the Joker from Batman. I would even argue that he played us all for fools, taking advantage of the huge following of the series to obtain the resources he desired.However, this accusation is irrelevant, because what is truly aggravating is the fact that the Joker is supposed to be a kingpin-an insane mastermind who knows how to bend people to his will, even Batman. His insanity is not what makes him scary; it\\'s how his genius conceals it, making the most unsound arguments seem reasonable. This is something that Nolan and Heath Ledger truly understood at its core.I don\\'t care if Todd Phillips wanted to do something different; he should have done it under a different name and not within Batman\\'s universe. In my view, it is terribly disrespectful to those who were expecting a worthy origin story. He knew what he was doing; he wanted to tell the story of a victim-with zero eloquence, zero ambition, zero intelligence, and a dull persona. In Batman, he is anything but. That\\'s why people are upset: \"you get what you deserve\" when you strip a character beyond recognition. Justice has been served by the audience, and honestly, I couldn\\'t be happier for this to become a cautionary tale for anyone who wants to ignore the fact that Batman and the Joker became popular in the first place not because there weren\\'t enough stories around.',\n",

The creators totally lost there marbles on this one, vs the main character.There is a song and dance sequence like every 7-8 minutes. Would have been nice, to have had a heads up that they changed the genre, as alot of us do not watch musicals. Maybe it was to accomodate Lady Gaga, but it totally missed the audiance. Hasn't been too many movies where groups of people are walking out of the cinema, but Joker 2 sure made that milestone. The director also misses a few details from previous movie and the batman franchise.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I've never seen a follow up movie revert so far back with a character when creating a sequel.The joker/arthur fleck at the start feels like he's reverted back to the beginning of the first movie.The back story for Harley Quinn as a character was non existent and changed like it wasn't important. The whole point of Harley is to show the impact of the joker n how he changed her, this was basically skipped.The musical aspect was sickening to the point I left after 1 hour and 15mins because I just couldn't watch it anymore.We've all been made aware of directors straying from source material e.g. Henry cavill with the Witcher series, halo etc.. Here we are again.I understand that the musical aspect worked from the first movie but having the characters in a dark story singing is just bizarre and completely different from having an iconic character dancing to a fitting soundtrack. It felt like the movie and story was adjusted to accommodate GaGa, like she'd had a musical clause in her contract.Overall I've never been so disappointed. To have such potential and destroy it like that was sickening. Surely seeing the Batman and penguin success, the blueprint was there and ignored.If I could get a refund I would. Joker 1 was different but still the joker. I don't even know what to call this. Save your money. Stay at home.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'This is what happens when you have a producer/team that actively hates the movie or show they\\'re supposed to make. Calling this a movie is an insult to other movies.Now I know that some people have a problem with it being a musical, which I\\'m personally not a fan of, but that\\'s somehow the least bad thing about this thing. It\\'s not a decision many people would have made, but it definitely could have worked if this were a stand alone movie, instead of sequel, which it barely is.The problem is more with the message & what they\\'ve done with the main character, which they clearly despise. Why make a movie you don\\'t wanna make, about a character that you hate? Who knows. I\\'d say they did it for a quick paycheck, but that\\'s not gonna happen with this monstrocity.Todd Phillips has admitted that comic movies aren\\'t real movies to him, which is an opinion he\\'s allowed to have, but then why make a comic movie then? And when it turns out to be a success (1st Joker movie) & you still hate it, why would you instead of doing the same thing again, sabotage the movie on purpose just because you personally don\\'t like it?If you don\\'t like the work you\\'re doing but you need the paycheck, there\\'s 2 options. You either do the work for the money or you find a different job that you actually want to do. He picked another option, do the job very poorly so you don\\'t get anything out of it. Not exactly a smart move.Now for the actual message of the movie, it\\'s very clear what they were trying to tell the audience, because of how subtle it was, like a hammer to the face. \"you need to stay in line & do as you\\'re told or there will be consequences. How dare you have hope or agency or stand up for yourself, you must be punished\" a message so despicable it made the audience & the critics agree with each other, which rarely happens, but miracles do exist, they just come in the most unexpected ways.As someone who liked the 1st movie, I\\'ll pretend like this thing doesn\\'t exist. How they managed to build up a character, just to break him down constantly in this is just sad. They really wanted to make us dislike this movie & they\\'ve succeeded.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"To me this is worst than the room in all the bad ways.i don't know how this man got an Oscar. Why was it even put in theatres. Big stain on everyone involved careers .To call it a film would be generous-it's more of a disjointed, pretentious mess disguised as something profound. The pacing is unbearable, like it's trying so hard to stretch its shallow material over a bloated runtime, all while pretending it has something deep to say. The script is an incoherent mix of clichés and empty provocations, with dialogue that sounds like it was written by someone who just discovered edgy internet forums.Joaquin Phoenix's performance, while praised by many, felt like nothing more than a series of exaggerated facial contortions and tics without any real depth behind them. It was more about spectacle than substance, and it's baffling that this one-dimensional portrayal was awarded with an Oscar. The film's attempt at psychological exploration is laughably superficial, and its forced edginess comes off as desperate.As for the direction, it feels like Todd Phillips was trying to mimic better filmmakers but missed the mark entirely. The tone is all over the place, and the cinematography, which some have praised, feels more like a cheap imitation of Scorsese's style. The whole thing reeks of self-importance without any justification for it.It's a film that mistakes being grim and joyless for being meaningful. The fact that it made it to theaters, let alone received critical acclaim, says more about the current state of Hollywood than the actual quality of this movie. Every person involved should seriously reconsider their creative choices.\",\n",

I recommend the first movie it's a really perfect depiction of a disturbed psychopath. I feel the director has lost his way in the sequel. Joker 2 is the worst sequel I have ever seen. The director has made it into a musical. Joaquin Phoenix is reduced to a co star in a really poor ripoff of LaLa Land the musical. I drove 30 miles and paid to watch this and was disappointed.Didn't anyone in the production of this film see the massive disappointment they were about to deliver.Didn't someone say along the way, we are making it into a musical.Joker was so good its sequel was expected to match or exceed it.A message to the director.

The tonal shift is so stark that it's hard to believe this is even the same character or world. Instead of delving deeper into Arthur Fleck's psyche, the film suddenly bursts into song and dance, completely disrupting the tension and grit that defined the first movie.Joaquin Phoenix, who brilliantly portrayed the tortured soul of Arthur in the first film, seems lost here. While he is still committed to the role, the musical format doesn't suit him or the character. It's hard to take the film seriously when moments of emotional intensity are broken up by surreal, Broadway-style performances that seem plucked from a different movie entirely.\",\n",

I don't need constant action to entertain me, but this movie had virtually nothing. It was just a man in jail, a man in a courtroom, and a man on the streets. All that it really did was tell us about the first movie, which constantly reminded me of how much better it was.When the credits rolled, I felt as if genuinely not a single second of that movie was enjoyable in the slightest and that I had completely and totally wasted my time. In fact, I'd argue that the ending is insulting to anyone who even moderately liked the first one simply because this whole movie accomplished absolutely nothing!I can not overstate how much nothing is going on here.

It's not telling a story, or an interesting one at least. While you know that there is growth on Joaquin's character, it doesn't makes sense, there is no real development, and as most elements in the movie it feels forced.-Length. The movie is unnecessarily long - there are no interesting dialogs, nothing that justifies its. To me, this boils down to poor editing. A sequence of a character walking to a jury stand takes over a minute, with no reason of being there, no purpose at all. What a waste of talents and resources.-The music. I knew it was a musical, and I actually enjoy them. Also, I used to like Lady Gaga's singing. But singing is so forced. Whenever the movie gives a glimpse of coherence, your ears start getting abused by the unnecessary, odd singing. Just because you have a singer in the cast, doesn't mean that you have to make her sing every time she comes into the screen. It felt like a hook or promo for LG, or a long music video that no one ask to see.Overall I feel bad for all of the people that work hard into making such a movie, the actors, extras, production, even investors - they are all doing their best. But not even Joaquin Phoenix can save such a mess of a movie.\",\n",

How can a movie studio in Hollywood approve a movie like this? There's a lot of pointless and boring singing and the plot and ending are a disaster. The whole story of Joker as we know it is simply changed here. You hope in vain that the Joker will finally develop into the Joker you know and admire him for. I loved the first Joker movie and couldn't wait to see the sequel. But when I found out that they had turned it into a musical, the joy was gone again. Unfortunately, I still went to the movies hoping that it wouldn't be so bad. However, it was much worse than I could have imagined. I used to love Lady Gaga, but in this movie, with all the stupid singing, she was just annoying.Please don't watch this movie. It's not worth the time and money.\",\n",

Yea, sure, no possible way that you just happen to enjoy a terrible film right? The movie is pretentious, the plot is paper thin, and yes, there is way too much singing. It\\'s hard to put into words how badly I dislike this movie.Joker 2 is actually a perfect Joker movie in a way because it is in fact a complete joke. As many have stated, this movie was dead the moment they decided to make it a musical. Those who like musicals in general is already a very small audience. Those who like musicals and enjoyed the first Joker has to be such a tiny number it makes you wonder what the execs who greenlit this sequel were thinking because it was a truly awful film to sit through.There is a reason virtually all live action versions of Harley Quinn have felt so bad in recent years, and it\\'s because Hollywood is too scared to write her as she\\'s supposed to be. The real Harley is supposed to be obsessed, infatuated, and completely crazy about Joker. For obvious reasons, Hollywood will not put this on screen because they\\'re terrified of being called s*xist. Harley just has to be a stronk woman now and that\\'s just never going to work because that\\'s not what she is as a character. Simple as that.Terrible movie, don\\'t waste your money as this movie will be streaming inside of 6 weeks.',\n",

While the original film captured the essence of the iconic character in a fresh and compelling way, the sequel struggles to find its footing and lacks the depth and complexity that made the first film so memorable.One of the key issues with \"Joker 2\" is its reliance on shock value and gratuitous violence, rather than exploring the character\\'s psychological depth and societal commentary as effectively as the first film did. The sequel feels more like a superficial attempt to replicate the success of the original, rather than offering a meaningful continuation of the story.Furthermore, the performances in \"Joker 2\" lack the raw emotional power that Joaquin Phoenix brought to the role in the first film. The character development feels shallow and forced, with the protagonist\\'s descent into madness coming across as contrived rather than organic.In terms of narrative structure, \"Joker 2\" feels disjointed and unfocused, with subplots that fail to connect in a meaningful way. The pacing is uneven, with long stretches of dull exposition followed by rushed and chaotic sequences that lack coherence.Overall, \"Joker 2\" fails to capture the magic of the original film, instead succumbing to clichés and missed opportunities. While there are moments of visual flair and stylistic bravado, they cannot save the film from its lackluster storytelling and uninspired direction.In conclusion, \"Joker 2\" is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to the lofty expectations set by its predecessor. It lacks the depth, nuance, and emotional resonance that made the original \"Joker\" a modern masterpiece, ultimately falling flat in its attempt to recapture the lightning in a bottle that made the first film so unforgettable.',\n",

The juxtaposition of upbeat songs with the film's heavy subject matter created a jarring dissonance that left the audience feeling confused and disconnected.Joaquin Phoenix delivered another strong performance as the titular character, but even his talent couldn't salvage a film that was fundamentally flawed. Lady Gaga's casting was intriguing, but her character felt underdeveloped and her singing, while impressive, didn't quite fit the world of the film.The story itself was predictable and lacked the depth and complexity of the original. The film's exploration of mental illness felt superficial, and the ending was unsatisfying and left many questions unanswered.In conclusion, Joker: Folie à Deux is a missed opportunity. It squandered the potential of the franchise and failed to live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. Fans of the first film will likely be disappointed by this sequel, which feels more like a cash grab than a genuine attempt to continue the story.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie A Deux or more appropriately Joker: F Me And You, is the single most disrespectful movie towards a character I've seen in my life. If you think I'm being hyperbolic, look at the scores I typically give, 90% of the time I give movies or shows scores it's either a 9 or 10 out of 10. This movie, however, is a special kind of disgrace.What makes it even more frustrating, is unlike most garbage movies, this is well shot, well-acted, and has genuinely good moments in it. A courtroom scene in particular is remarkably well done. Visually, it's superb. But anytime an ounce of momentum gets built within the story, it's cut off by a stupid musical number and has to start over from square one. That happens time and time again until you can't wait for the movie to end.When it does, you're left wondering...how did this get made? It retroactively ruins a solid first entry, does everything it can to embarrass the most iconic villain in fiction, and was somehow still pointless. It ends exactly where the movie started. If you cut the first two hours and only left us with the final scene, nothing about the movie changes, except the audience would feel less insulted.\",\n",

They approached from a unique angle and developed a great character for us to invest in.In a time when superhero movies had all gone to a ridiculous large scale with multiverses and alien invasions (which I enjoy), I really like that the original felt more reality based. I recommended it to people that don't even particularly like superhero stuff. It was a great drama that happened to be about a comic book character. But the core audience was still Batman fans. It's not an audience that was calling for a musical. I'm all in favour of people taking chances with being creative but think this should have been something done with a different joker and completely stand alone.The original was an amazing film. Could easily have been left alone or build its own franchise. Now they've buried it. Such a waste of great potential.\",\n",

This film is a disservice to the iconic character of the Joker and a waste of your time and money.The storyline, such as it is, is a flimsy excuse for a movie. It's a disjointed mess that jumps from scene to scene without any clear direction or purpose. The plot is so thin that it's practically transparent, and the pacing is sluggish and unengaging. Its unfortunate inclusion of gratuitous gayism in the early stages left me feeling disappointed and disengaged.What's even more disappointing is the treatment of the Joker character. The iconic villain is reduced to a caricature of himself, stripped of his complexity and depth. The portrayal is shallow and one-dimensional, lacking the nuance and psychological intrigue that has made the Joker such a compelling character in the past.The only saving grace of this film is the musical score, which is surprisingly well-done (Sarcasm hits everyone). However, it's not enough to salvage the overall experience. The music is completely overshadowed by the lackluster acting, direction, and writing.I would strongly advise against watching Joker Folie a Deux. It's a waste of your time and money, and it will leave you feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. If you're looking for a good movie, I recommend checking out something else. There are plenty of better options out there.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I went into Joker 2024 with high expectations, especially after the success of the 2019 film. Unfortunately, this sequel was a complete letdown. The plot felt disjointed and lacked the depth that made the first Joker so impactful. Rather than expanding on Arthur Fleck's psychological journey, it seemed like the film was trying too hard to capitalize on the original's success without adding anything meaningful.The addition of Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn was unnecessary and felt forced. Her character didn't add any value to the story, and her portrayal came across as more of a distraction than an asset. It almost felt like a stunt casting decision rather than a thoughtful addition to the narrative. Instead of delving deeper into the twisted dynamics of Joker's mind, the film shifted its focus to musical numbers and melodrama, which diluted the dark and gritty atmosphere that fans were hoping for.Visually, the film tried to replicate the aesthetic of its predecessor, but even that fell flat. The cinematography lacked the raw intensity that made the original Joker stand out, and the pacing dragged, making the film feel much longer than it needed to be.In the end, Joker 2024 feels like a missed opportunity. Instead of exploring new and complex ideas, it rehashes old themes with less impact. It's a pale imitation of the original, and sadly, it just didn't live up to the hype.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'My expectation: this should be the best movie in 2024, even better than Dune 2 possibly.Reality: Me audience turn into a real joker.As a huge fan of the first \"Joker,\" my anticipation for \"Joker 2\" was through the roof. The original film delivered a powerful blend of character study and social commentary, leaving audiences captivated by Arthur Fleck\\'s descent into madness. I expected the sequel to elevate this experience, possibly even surpassing other cinematic giants of 2024, like \"Dune: Part Two.\" However, the reality of \"Joker 2\" transformed my excitement into a disheartening experience, leaving me feeling more like a \"real joker\" than an entertained moviegoer.From the moment the film began, it was clear that the tone was markedly different. The striking visuals and haunting score that characterized the first film felt absent, replaced by a muddled narrative that struggled to find its footing. While I had hoped for a deep exploration of Arthur\\'s psyche and the societal factors that shaped him, the sequel instead meandered through disjointed storylines and underdeveloped characters. It felt as though the filmmakers were attempting to replicate the success of the first film without fully understanding what made it resonate with audiences.One of my main disappointments was the handling of supporting characters. The original \"Joker\" featured a memorable cast that complemented Arthur\\'s journey, but \"Joker 2\" felt like a missed opportunity. Instead of providing depth and context, many characters were mere shadows of their potential, leaving me yearning for more substance. It was frustrating to watch as the film juggled various subplots, none of which managed to coalesce into a coherent narrative.Furthermore, the pacing of \"Joker 2\" left much to be desired. Moments that could have been powerful and impactful were often rushed, while less significant scenes dragged on. This uneven pacing contributed to a sense of disconnection from the characters, making it difficult for me to engage with their struggles. By the time the film reached its climax, I found myself emotionally detached, unable to invest in the outcome of Arthur\\'s journey.Visually, I had expected the same level of artistry that marked the first film. Instead, \"Joker 2\" seemed to rely on gimmicks rather than innovation. The cinematography lacked the striking imagery that made the original so iconic, and the score, once a haunting presence, felt generic and uninspired. The film failed to create the atmospheric tension that had drawn me into Arthur\\'s world in the first place.In conclusion, while my expectations for \"Joker 2\" were sky-high, the reality was a disheartening experience that left me feeling like a true joker. The film\\'s failure to deliver a compelling narrative, coupled with its underdeveloped characters and lackluster visuals, made for a disappointing viewing experience. As I reflect on my journey through this sequel, I can\\'t help but wish it had embraced the depth and artistry that made the original so unforgettable. For those seeking a continuation of Arthur Fleck\\'s story, be prepared for a ride that may leave you feeling more bewildered than entertained.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker 2: A Tedious Misfire That Misses the MarkWhen the first *Joker* movie was released in 2019, it arrived like a punch to the gut-a bold, daring take on the iconic villain that managed to be both thought-provoking and entertaining. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance captured the essence of a man spiraling into madness, set against a backdrop of societal decay, making it a cinematic masterpiece. However, any goodwill that was earned by the first film has been obliterated by *Joker 2*, a tedious, pretentious sequel that is a pale shadow of its predecessor.Let\\'s not mince words here: *Joker 2* is a complete disaster. The movie is a plodding, slow-burn slog through two hours of absolutely nothing of value. It lacks not only the excitement and intensity that defined the first film, but also any sense of direction or purpose. Instead of offering a deep dive into the psyche of its disturbed protagonist, the film meanders aimlessly, giving audiences little more than a meandering mess of disjointed scenes and underwhelming performances.To call this movie boring would be an understatement. The pacing is so glacial it makes watching paint dry feel like a thrill ride. The tension that was so palpable in the first *Joker* is nowhere to be found. Instead, we are left with long, drawn-out scenes that serve no purpose other than to test the viewer\\'s patience. Each moment feels like it was stretched out to fill time, with no regard for whether it actually contributes to the narrative or character development. The \"slow-burn\" approach might work if there was some payoff or if the scenes built towards something profound. But in *Joker 2*, there is no payoff. No crescendo. No catharsis. Just an interminable, soul-crushing march toward nothingness.And then there\\'s Lady Gaga, whose inclusion in this movie is one of its biggest missteps. The idea of casting her might have sounded good on paper, but in practice, it\\'s a monumental failure. Her portrayal is laughably bad, a grating and uninspired performance that is more annoying than anything else. To say she can\\'t sing would be too kind. It\\'s as if the filmmakers were trying to shove her into this film in an effort to make it more \"artsy\" or \"avant-garde,\" but instead, it backfires spectacularly. Every time she\\'s on screen, it feels like a bad karaoke night that refuses to end.Speaking of which, why was there so much emphasis on musical elements in this movie? Did we sign up for a crime drama or an amateur cabaret? If I wanted to sit through a painfully awkward musical performance, I\\'d watch an off-Broadway show in a basement theater. But this is supposed to be *Joker 2*-a follow-up to one of the most intense, psychological films of the past decade-and what we get instead is a painfully cringeworthy attempt at blending musical and crime drama elements that feel as mismatched as oil and water.The film, at times, resembles a bad episode of *Law and Order*-not in its best seasons, mind you, but in those filler episodes they cranked out to pad a season. The crime and tension that were integral to the first *Joker* film are now replaced by dull, predictable scenes that wouldn\\'t be out of place in a third-rate procedural. If you\\'ve seen one crime scene in this movie, you\\'ve seen them all. The drama, the stakes, the intrigue-everything that should define a great crime movie-are completely absent here.The writing is perhaps the worst offender. It\\'s as if the screenwriters forgot what made the first film work. The gritty realism, the visceral sense of tension, the tragic spiral of a man lost in his own mental instability-it\\'s all gone. Instead, we get what amounts to a second-rate art-house film trying to pass off pretension as depth. It feels like the writers believed that by slowing everything down, by dragging every scene past its breaking point, they were creating something profound. In reality, they just produced something unbearable.Even Phoenix, as talented as he is, can\\'t save this train wreck. It\\'s hard to blame him, though-what can an actor do when the script gives him so little to work with? His character feels flat, drained of the energy and complexity that made him so compelling in the first film. Gone is the tormented, unpredictable force of nature. In his place is a character so stripped of nuance that even Phoenix seems to be sleepwalking through his scenes.If you were expecting an exhilarating, thought-provoking follow-up to the first *Joker*, you will be sorely disappointed. What we have here is a vapid, tiresome exercise in patience, a film so devoid of excitement or substance that it feels like an insult to anyone who admired the original. *Joker 2* is not just bad-it\\'s offensively bad, a movie so misguided and poorly executed that it feels like a slap in the face to anyone who enjoyed the first film.',\n",

More than enraged I am insulted at the level of disregard to one of the greatest characters ever created.The fault falls on Todd Phillips, Warner rothers and DC, they should never be allowed to make another film in their entire miserable lifespan.I came into the movie wanting it to prove everyone wrong, to give me a sense of awe and marvel, instead I came out hating cinema at its very foundation, no movie in my entire life has made me feel this way.Every copy of this film should be burn, destroyed and buried, along with the career if Todd Phillips, who does not deserve the privileges bestowed upon him.Loving cinema sometimes means loathing it. I have seen more than my fair share of horse crap movies. But Joker: Folie à Deux is without the shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie I ever seen in my entire life.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'This second installment of Joker, Folie à Deux, is not only an artistic betrayal but also an affront to the legacy of the iconic character that is the Joker. From the very first moments, it becomes clear that the film seeks to demystify and disarm what makes the Clown Prince of Crime so great and terrifying. The Joker, in his original form, is the embodiment of pure chaos, a being whose complete lack of remorse and conscience is his strength and allure. Yet, this film makes the tragic mistake of over-humanizing him.By showing him vulnerable, filled with doubts, remorse, and regrets, the film strips away what makes him so magnetic: his absolute refusal to conform to societal rules, his relentless nihilism. The audience is faced with a broken man, sick, tormented by his identity, which not only breaks with what the character represents but is also deeply disappointing for those expecting to see the Joker we know and fear.This approach, far from adding depth, actually dilutes the complexity of the Joker. Where pure and unpredictable madness once reigned, we are now subjected to clumsy introspection that betrays not only the character\\'s DNA but also the essence of what made the first installment so successful. The Joker is not a man to be understood or excused; he is a force of disorder, the very personification of chaos.In the end, this film feels more like a disjointed psychological exploration, a spin-off that might have been interesting for another character but certainly not for the Joker. In trying to make him more \"human,\" the film removes everything that makes him unique and terrifying. A weakened, lost Joker, unable to recognize himself in his own actions, is a true insult to the legacy of this iconic character.',\n",

They spent a lot of time going over the causes of his trauma, his obsession with being on a late night talk show, and finally the outburst that would display his true madness. Chain-smoking aside, it was a good movie.THIS MOVIE, however, fell flat for me. As I noticed in the first movie, although I sort of enjoyed it, it seems the writers and actors had no prior knowledge of the characters. Harleen Quinzel was a psychologist whose sessions with Joker began to crack her sanity until she developed an obsessive love for him. In this movie, she's a patient with a Joker obsession, completely negating the nuance of their relathionship. It would've been far more interesting to see the original verion, interviewing Joker, beginning to empathize with him, and then develop an obsession; something more gradual rather than forced.While they introduced some interesting concepts like Harvey Dent and the movie's ending, I didn't enjoy the overall product.\",\n",

The cinematography is striking, and the soundtrack once again plays a key role in setting the eerie, unsettling tone. The performances, especially from Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, are committed and intense, elevating the film\\'s character-driven moments. However, the storyline at times meanders and leans into more theatrical territory, making it feel less grounded and more abstract than the original.While the actors deliver impressive performances, the development of Arthur and Harley\\'s relationship feels rushed in parts, and the film doesn\\'t delve as deeply into their psychological complexities as it could.

       "    'Review': \"I am 57 years old and I have seen hundreds of films in my life. I can honestly say that this is the absolute worst film I have ever seen. It is a piece of utter crap. Something that is an open insult to an audience that has paid good money to waste two hours of their lives. There is absolutely nothing in this film, it's a vacuous, empty and meaningless waste of time. The first film was a tragic masterpiece that was in a strange sort of way actually quite moving. You could at least feel a grain of sympathy for someone who had been abused all his life and finally cracked in a burst of insane violence. But this film lacked any kind of storyline and the Lady Gaga character was not even explained properly, she just appeared out of nowhere, a complete nonentity with no purpose. The Joker himself appeared resigned, sullen and uninteresting - completely different from the original film. The ending and the Joker's fate was not surprising, but again, it was sudden and unexplained, no real motive behind it. This piece of crap is absolutely shameful, and I hope this director is not given any more opportunities to produce junk such as this.\",\n",

They don\\'t try to make us laugh even once, not genuinely. The tone is unrelentingly grim.It\\'s not clever. The jukebox musical numbers are inserted carelessly and add absolutely nothing to the plot, which in itself is practically non-existent.It\\'s not well-staged. There isn\\'t a single memorable set piece in the entire godawful production. It\\'s actually quite gawdy and awkward.It\\'s not interesting. The \"plot,\" such as it is, rambles and stagnates and stutters from point to point without any sense of purpose or direction.It\\'s not well-acted. Lady GaGa is completely wasted, both as an actress and a singer. Joaquin Phoenix is wasted too, as he barely even spends any time as his Joker alter-ego, and his time as Arthur Fleck is dreadfully dull.It\\'s frankly painful to sit through.Whether or not that was the point of making it, I truly don\\'t care. It has zero redeeming qualities.It should be played over and over again to violent criminals in institutions as a method of torture.',\n",

But Todd Philips decided to be Todd Philips and make another wasteful sequel to a great stand alone story. I had low expectations but dear God it was worse than that! It is a musical... That doesn\\'t work! The dark tones the first Joker film had that made it so special and feel so good are ruined here. This is basically how the musical works, Remember when Arthur Fleck discovered those papers indicating he was adopted and Tortured as a child in the first film? Imagine if he discovered that and just started cheerfully signing after that... That\\'s what this movie is! It was so painful that is why it was a kick to the brain. I don\\'t know if I feel stupid for trying to think this would be decent or Stupid not to see the clear money grab Todd Philips just robbed of me. Please, appreciate solo stories.',\n",

Law & Order is better on most weeks and , thankfully , also shorter.Is it a musical? Not really enough music to fit that bill and frankly the plot to Tommy made more sense.Is it a comic book movie? Maybe an unfinished mini series by Silver Wolf that just faded out from lack of interest I guess.Is it good? Lord no.No matter what it is you will come into this film expecting it will let you down in every way.Even if you come in hoping to just see the train wreck Todd created as a clear and blatant cash grab even in that it just falls flatter than a fart no one else ever hears.And that is it isn\\'t it? This was all just a cash grab by the production.Todd Phillips should have learned he was not very good with sequels the last time around.Gaga is no Margot Robbie in the role of Harley. Phoenix looks like he realized what he was into after he was already contractually obligated.Go re-watch the first. Go watch one of the Harley flicks or the as good as gold season 1 of the cartoon she had. Go clip your nails.

Furthermore, there was a clear limit to Joker's potential by trying to not resemble Kieth Ledger's version. If there was more freedom to explore the dramatic nature of Joker's personality, then the film would have been more of a success. Throughout the film, there were a lot of mysteries that kept me entertained, but didn't turn out as satisfying as they did in the first movie. Finally, the film evokes numerous emotions and may effect the audience in an angy matter.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'I don\\'t think the reviews on IMDB do justice to what a God Awful job the creators of this film achieved. Okay it\\'s a musical, but the least they could have done is make the musical numbers relevant to the story-line. I may as well have been watching Puddles Pity Party Feat Lady Gaga (which ironically I probably would enjoy)..\\nThe film is basically a court room drama, with a romance sideline story. There is absolutely nothing DC about this film apart from Location and Character names. You could Joker to Janitor, Change Gotham to Chicago, and have Lady Gaga play a character of a different name, and the film would be pretty much identical.And to anyone interested YES it IS a musical. I estimate that about 50% of the film are musical numbers that don\\'t move the story along.I think what vexes me the most is the cast. It\\'s great!, and the actual ACTING is fantastic. But this film did not work because some \"Blue-sky-thinker\" at Warner Bros, said in a board meeting \"Hey, here\\'s a crazy idea... Why don\\'t we make it a musical???\". To whomever that person is, I hope your personal hell is watching this film on repeat for the rest of eternity.... Actually no.. I have sat through this film, and the once I sat through it felt like an eternity. I wouldn\\'t want to wish that on anyone.One of the first things someone is going to do when this hits the internet is go through and re-edit this film to cut out all the musical numbers.I would like to go further, but fear that my account would be deactivated if I actually said what I want to.',\n",

Nothing made sense in this film, from the sequence of events to the characters. At one point, the judge says he won\\'t tolerate any circus in his courtroom, yet the entire movie was a circus.They made this mess just for the final scene, where Joker is killed by the \"real\" Joker, hoping to pave the way for a third part.

It's a deconstruction of the first film, with meta elements similar to the matrix 4, if you loved that movie then this is for you and you alone, for everyone else you will hate this film, it's trying so hard to stick a middle finger up at you as revenge for you not enjoying joker 1 the way todd wanted you to and for daring to have your own opinions and to think for yourself and see Arthur Fleck like Todd wanted you to, a sad and pathetic loser who was worth nothing and committed horrible atrocities (in his view) who deserved no sympathy, after the fact (once the movie released and was a massive success)The movie is a beautiful train wreck, it looks visually stunning and is well shot and the technical aspects are pretty much 10/10 but is made purely as an F U to all those who loved the first. It a musical with terrible original songs that are spectical only and don't make you feel anything, south park did it better 23 years ago. The story is paper thin and gave away the ending with the trailer, typical Hollywood.People say the ending is controversial but it's not really once you know how Todd felt after the success of the first. Todd makes sure it's painfully obvious he's giving you the complete opposite of what a fan would want from this movie and the ending is just the nails in the coffin.At many points the ending included you think you're going to finally get some satisfaction and get what you came to see but no, the film is just subverting expections the movie. The ending is absolutely horrendous and literally ra**es the predecessor, I would of honestly preferred Arthur hit his head and woke up from a dream to then have the credits roll.If you're a fan of the first avoid like the plague this is honestly one of the worst sequels ever made.I hope it bombs and Todd Phillips's reputation never recovers.He did a hangover 3 again, I hope he never makes another movie.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"When the cartoon show opened the sequel showing Arthur The Joker impersonated by his shadow to take the stage and getting brutally thrashed by Police filling the screen with blood to show the title of the sequel, I got goosebumps. But, soon after the story revealed and it was actually looking freezed for adding literally nothing new to Joker, I got pissed. Lady Gaga is just a showpiece in this. No background story of her. What she tells to Arthur is also admitted as a lie by herself. Obviously, this movie that shows The Joker put in trial after the court should have a good argument from Prosecution & Defence. Sadly, this one fails too. Watch this only for Phoenix who has acted well, but provided with a story way below The Joker legacy. This sequel is like a coffin for that Masterpiece Original JOKER. I wish I had never seen this one as it took away the admiration I'd for JOKER to a great extent. If you want to try this, please leave any expectations based on the original. It is good for nothing.\",\n",

Why?? Just because she can sing? How about acting?

It is so far away from the real origins of the original Joker and associated films...shocking!I can't remember the last time a film ended and the general vibe, from the audience, was so underwhelming. What were the scriptwriters and Directors thinking? They totally mishandled the stewardship of the franchise.The lead actors are good - but there was so much depth that could have been unlocked by those actors with the right script. So, it was a wasted opportunity and an experiment, gone wrong.If there is a 3rd film to the series - and I hope there is, then please make sure it returns to it's origins - instead of making another pantomime.\",\n",

Arkham inmates might as well have been given a spoonful of sugar to help their medicine go down! However, this really doesn't work as a savy cinematography trick that's convincing of psychosis either-more like a meloncholy Gotham crossed with Grease. It's just not the one that I want. Arthur Fleck is a pitiful Joker. This killer is given that tiresome 'victim' angle from which he never transcends into the legendary supervillain. The only tie to the traditional DC Joker is face paint and a goofy laugh. It's a long, drawn out, boring, pointless sequel that leads nowhere.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Let me just start things off as simple as possible and if you want to read the rest of the review, that's fine. This is the worst sequel ever made.If you are a fan of that first joker movie and if you're a comic book fan in general... this movie hates you, and everyone that supported the first joker. This is a middle finger to an entire fanbase in cinematic form. Everyone that agreed to do this movie, including Lady Gaga, Joaquin Phoenix, Todd Phillips, and all of the returning cast and crew should be ashamed of themselves.I'm not gonna spoil the movie, but I have to be honest with you... Don't see this. Hes not even the Joker throughout most of the film, unless it some of the musical numbers OH YEAH BY THE WAY, this is a musical now. Also, the ending doesn't make any sense and it basically ruins not only this entire movie but the first movie as well. They're basically is no story by the way. Without the musical numbers, this movie would be 45 minutes long and to be honest with you with the way the story goes. There's no reason for this movie to exist. Literally zero. Also, they completely change Harley Quinn's character, And even the same character anymore in fact, they don't even call her Harley. Might as well have not even use her in this movie and just called her a completely different person and it would've been exactly the same same. Arthur Fleck also doesn't act at all like how he did at the end of the first movie and it kind of retracts back to how he was at the beginning which doesn't make sense because the whole point of that first movie is that he evolved into the joker. There's a ton of holes in this movie and people show back up and things happen in this that don't match up at all with the first movie. And I understand that they keep using the excuse that he imagines and always hallucinates things, but that can only go so far. This movie literally seemed like Todd Phillips made a fake script and sent it to the studio because he didn't want to do a sequel but the studio couldn't figure that out and they made him make the movie anyway and now he's being forced to make a fake script for a movie that he didn't wanna make. That's honestly how it feels. It really does feel like at the end though that this movie was an intentional , stab in the back to all the people that were fans with that first movie. Because it's so cynical towards not just the people that follow the joker and who the joker is, but also that a fan of the comics in general and also other adaptations of those comics. There's one Instance, especially towards the end, that is not only extremely confusing, but it's also just really disrespectful and insulting in general that makes it seem like the person who made this movie was genuinely trying to piss people off.So yeah... I think it goes without saying at this point I did not like this movie. But I have to be honest with you. I have never hated a film more in my entire life. This movie has wasted my time, and my money, and Many many many months of not only being excited for this movie but also for the first movie as well and which this movie destroys coinciding. If you like the first joker, please do not watch this. This is without a doubt, my least favorite movie of all time.\",\n",

More than one online periodical is arguing that this movie was made with malice towards the Batman franchise, as well as its fans, some news outlets even applauding this decision: hailing it as a \"subversion\" of the superhero genre.Fans of the comic books and prior Batman movies regard the Joker as the criminal mastermind and complex character he was originally written to be. Those moviegoers are expecting a tense and violent drama, hearty action sequences, and blood and gore. The decision to greenlight a musical and legal procedural Joker sequel is a massive faux pas; one that cannot be excused thru ignorance or even creativity. No, this decision was done knowing the consequences, which are now manifesting as disbelief, anger, frustration and a pathetic box office reception.One of my acting teachers in Manhattan explained to me that \"America does not want to come home to Medea\", meaning that the average American comes home from a brutal day at work and is received by chores, disobedient children, bills, endless worries and never-ending demands. They want to relax. They want to be entertained. There is a time and place for thoughtful, deeply reflective cinema, and this is not it. -- There is absolutely nothing wrong with a subculture of action movie goers -- They appreciate the fun and excitement the excessive violence causes them to feel. It\\'s fiction and fantasy and has its place in our life as a distraction; one that the incredibly responsible working class deserves.For Hollywood millionaires and their lackeys to be able to suggest, authorize, produce and distribute such an incredibly pompous and miserly film using a franchise that stands for the exact opposite themes it embodies is a clear sign of an industry gone terribly wrong. An industry that answers to no one and is funded under feigned interest to inform and educate when it clearly patronizes with disdain, untroubled by any repercussions.',\n",

Director Todd Philips crafts the story of Joker and Harley Quinn and the romance surrounding them but despite it's production, costumes, and performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga being solid, Joker: Folie à Deux ends up falling into issue of style over substance which causes the movie fall into the lines of: pretentious filmmaking.Joker was a solid movie that has some interesting themes and concepts while being slightly bloated with itself. Unfortunately, this sequel ends up being a bit too full of itself with its simple narrative that ends up making it's themes feel bloated, predictable, and honestly, uninteresting. The atmosphere, musical score, production, and style tries to make it seem the narrative is better and greater, however, as a whole, the narrative is really messy and basic which really drags the movie down and makes it feel like a bore fest. On the musical score, the musical score is solid but the singing was mostly alright and the songs are pretty forgettable.The characters of Joker and Harley have some interesting charm and dynamics between them, but despite the strong performance from Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, the laughably dialogue, uninteresting side characters, and tone that takes itself WAY too seriously doesn't do much justice. Including Philips' direction being kind of all over the place.Philips really tries to grasp hard to move away from the derivative comedy movies in his past career and lean into dramatic works but unfortunately, he seems to fail to stray away from it.At the end, Todd Philips tries to make something serious but unfortunately fails to successfully strive with a dramatic tale.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"After waiting 5 years for the sequel to the original Joker (2019), I felt that this simply was not what I nor many others were looking for. The first film, starring Joaquin Phoenix was a veritable masterpiece that left the audience chomping at the bit for more. It was an elegant commentary on the downfall of society in a fictitious New York City, and the outcasts that were shadows, ignored by the elites, with a heavy look into mental health. This continuation was none of that. It lacked direction and the tempo was inconsistent. Every time a storyline would get going and the audience was drawn in, there would be yet another musical number, turning a flowing movie into a staccato of disconnect. This film feels like a loose Joker story that's been precariously wrapped around a Lady Gaga album, and not her good ones either. There was very little that redeems this movie, apart from the sets and costuming. Phoenix is an amazing, talented actor, but even he could not make this series rise from the ashes.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I just saw Joker 2 in the cinema, and boy, oh boy, it is, well, terrible. As others have mentioned, it is not because the acting, music, direction, singing, or any other obvious aspect of it is bad. It is all very well executed, and Gaga, Pheonix and everybody else did a good job. Bravo, well done.So yes, it does not deserve one star.So what is wrong with it? Well read on to find out.The first movie, although not perfect, was very good. Why can't the first movie just be left alone then? Does everything very good, need a sequal?Because this sequal, tries the very best it can to UNDO everything that happened in the first movie. It tries to rectify, all the evil of the world (Gotham) and make everything right again. I will not be going into any more detail than that, because that will spoil both the first movie, and this one.But we as an audience, don't need anything to be put to rights! We don't need anything that the second movie has to offer: We are in the theater to escape our miserable lives, and to be entertained for two and a half hours. To watch something even more miserable, which this is, is not an escape.So what makes this movie so miserable you ask? Hold on to your popcorn, because here it comes:THIS SEQUAL wants us to NOT forget that Joker is fiction, and that to me, seeking an escape from reality, is the biggest insult of all.I am not stupid. I know Joker is fiction, I don't need to be told this through a movie with the same name.Should I feel guilty for routing for Joker in the first movie? According to this movie: Yes, I should be very ashamed indeed.So yes, I am sorry folks. If you can, avoid this movie at all costs! It is an insult to everyone involved with cinema, and everybody who just wants an escape, every once in a while.\",\n",

The only reason this sequel exists is for the cynical cash grab and so artsy people get to make artsy movies. Hollywood and the East Coast think the rest of us grew up in private schools and we are all actors and writers. No one that liked The Joker ever asked for a musical. Then you mix that with courtroom drama? Why not sprinkle a little summer stock comedy throughout as well? How about some Shakespeare?Lady Gaga gets type cast which is too bad because if anyone gave a crap and actually wanted to make a dark movie about these characters she could probably turn a really interesting performance in, but I guess we'll never know. If you grew up in theater class from the time you were 4 years old or went to Harvard and studied theater you're going to love this movie.\",\n",

Fifteen minutes after, I started thinking oh ok, I can sort of understand why they've decided to add some musical numbers. But then, and for the rest of the 2hr 18 minutes film I kept asking myself what the actual (expletive) am I watching here?!? This is truly awful!I really enjoyed the first film and whilst I think it took a reductionist approach to mental illness I still believe that the first film was well directed, with some of the visuals being pure magic at times. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant, the supporting cast led by Robert de Niro was excellent.Folie à Deux is, simply put, a pointless film and I expect it to be a monumental flop. I can only imagine the early development workshops for this film. 'How about we take our celebrated film in a completely different direction! Let's not have a story or a plot to drive it, let's chuck in Lady Gaga because she's still appealing to 12% of our preferred demographic meaning that we can turn this into a musical, but (here's the key concept) we'll only include the most irritating music imaginable.' To which the Executive Producers respond: 'I like it!'An angry score of 2 stars because I'm generous. 1 star each for Joaquin Phoenix for his portrayal of a sad, weak and pathetic joker and Lady Gaga who was surprisingly good (pointless but good). Anyone who enjoyed the original will in all likelihood hate this sequel. Save your money, let it flop.\",\n",

Its the aftermath, Arthur imprisoned. Awaiting trial. And court sequences. A climatic escape. But to come back in full circle.The direction was dumb. Director tried to make this a musical. Big mistake. A lot of the musical sequences is all in Arthurs head. Makes it more crazy. The musical sequences is eye rolling stupid. It literally takes up majority of the films running time. It was best to cut those sequences and keep the main plot focused.Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga are great but there performances are wasted in a script that does not build to any development.

Lady Gaga's performance as Harley Quinn lacks conviction-she plays more of a version of herself than the complex, chaotic character fans expect. Her chemistry with the Joker feels off, as the power dynamic between them is reversed. Instead of Harley being obsessed with the Joker, it feels like the Joker is the one clinging to her, which makes DC's most iconic villain look weak and unthreatening. This portrayal softens the Joker into a shadow of the menacing figure he's meant to be, leaving fans missing Margot Robbie's far more engaging and authentic Harley Quinn.\",\n",

The direction is as listless as the plot, with scenes dragged out beyond reason and no urgency or intensity to the story. Gotham isn't menacing or dark-it's just any old city, stripped of the gritty, malignant personality that usually defines it. Watching, I immediately wished Heath Ledger's Joker could burst onto the screen to breathe life into this lackluster version.Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga put in the work, but even their solid performances can't save the film from itself. The few bursts of action were teased in the trailer, so don't expect anything fresh. It's as if the director decided to turn Joker into a two-hour waiting room with mood music. It's the cinematic equivalent of watching paint dry. Don't waste your time, see The Substance to be mesmerized by Demi, or Strange Darling for a bit of sadistic fun.\",\n",

The style neither fits in the overall lore nor does it do the weak story any good, it went straight strongly annoying after the third song. Regarding the story the script is super weak and without spoiling any big parts (wouldn\\'t be a loss though), it mashes all the good the prequel has build up directly in the dirt.

It does not emphasise on the key points of the first movie. Seems like they just took the whole cast of the first movie while adding Gaga and waiting for the fans to take the bait, ignoring the weak scenario.Unfortunately the amazing cinematography is not enough to save a bad written film.

       "    'Review': 'Arthur Fleck was a harrowing character study, a one-man show capturing Arthur Fleck\\'s transformation into the Joker. Its gritty realism and psychological depth were its selling points. Todd Phillips\\' sequel, however, strayed from this formula, losing the original\\'s essence. Where \"Joker\" was intimate and raw, \"Joker 2\" felt like it was reaching for spectacle, diluting the powerful singular focus of its predecessor. Introduced into this delicate formula was Lady Gaga. While a talented performer, her inclusion altered the dynamics significantly. Instead of blending seamlessly into the dark tapestry of Gotham, her presence felt somewhat disjointed. Her portrayal, possibly a nod to her musical prowess, clashed with the tone set by Joaquin Phoenix\\'s Arthur. This not only distracted from the narrative but also undermined the gritty realism that made the first film so impactful. The seamless storytelling of \"Joker\" was lost in the sequel. Todd Phillips seemed to aim for a broader narrative scope, yet this choice backfired. The tight, introspective focus of Arthur\\'s world expanded, but not in a way that added depth or coherence. Instead, it felt fragmented, as if multiple storylines were vying for attention without a clear sense of direction.Dilution of Themes: \"Joker\" tackled themes of mental illness and societal neglect with precision. \"Joker 2,\" however, wavered in its thematic focus. The powerful undercurrents of the original were replaced with more convoluted, less impactful messages, diluting the emotional and psychological resonance that had captivated audiences initially.The tonal consistency of \"Joker\" was one of its strengths. The sequel, however, struggled to maintain this, oscillating between its dark roots and a more theatrical, almost operatic presentation. This shift created a dissonance that was jarring for viewers expecting a continuation of the first film\\'s somber realism. In essence, while attempting to expand the universe of \"Joker,\" Todd Phillips lost sight of the intimate, character-driven narrative that made the first film a success. Lady Gaga\\'s performance, though not without merit, contributed to this departure, further distancing \"Joker 2\" from the original\\'s raw, unfiltered portrayal of Arthur Fleck\\'s descent into madness. The result was a film that, despite its ambitions, fell short of the bar set by its predecessor.',\n",

The singing (and there was A LOT of singing) came at really annoying points when you would much rather a storyline/charscters being developed instead. To be fair, Joaquin Phoenix was excellent as usual but I was hoping that his character would develop more than it did. In fact, nothing much actually happened in the film and I started to feel quite bored in many parts, especially the singing bits. Towards the end I was willing the film to end just because nothing had really happened for over 2 hours apart from about 15 (boring) songs. By the time the end twist came I felt so bored that I didn't really care what happened and it didn't seem shocking or exciting. I was just glad to leave the cinema!

The entire movie feels written around having Lady Gaga sing as much as possible, even in the scenes she's not in.Phoenix's acting got a downgrade, he feels bored and out of it the entire film, we could argue the character calls for that, but it is, most likely, the actor just not being comfortable playing the Joker anymore (for PC reasons).There was a single, beautifully acted and profound scene, and it was just a call back to the first movie.

It might have worked to some degree if it wasn\\'t such a prominent part of the movie and if the rest of the movie had more to offer, but putting a legal procedural that did a lot of rehashing of the first movie around the musical fell flat and just didn\\'t entertain.Just an all-around disjointed flop and to be clear, none of that is on Joaquin Phoenix or Lady Gaga who are both talented actors and do the best they can with the material. It\\'s 100% on the writers and producers who, in the name of boldness(?) managed to follow up a great movie with one of the worst sequels ever.Sad and disappointed for what could have been.',\n",

Phoenix once again proves his depth as an actor, embodying the chaotic, tortured psyche of Arthur Fleck with precision. Lady Gaga brings intensity to her role, and their chemistry is palpable. However, despite the strong acting, the film falters significantly in other areas.The story lacks coherence and feels disconnected from the foundation built in the first Joker film. The narrative seems to meander without clear direction, relying too much on spectacle and musical numbers rather than meaningful plot development. What could have been a deep dive into shared psychosis or a compelling exploration of two fractured minds instead becomes muddled and overly abstract.Additionally, the movie drags on far too long, with many scenes feeling stretched beyond necessity. This pacing issue, combined with a disjointed story, makes it a slog to get through. While the performances keep it from being a total failure, Joker: Folie à Deux ultimately feels like a missed opportunity, weighed down by its own ambition.',\n",

Trying to make a character like Arthur Fleck sympathetic to the point of being an anti-hero is questionable story telling at best. He's ill and was let down by poor healthcare but that's more about how terrible the U. S. is about that sort of thing, not indicative to how a society(tm) let him down. Not having accountability means you're not a good person.Anyway, I don't want to really give anything away but I found this to be very boring and overstuffed with nonsense.

How they came to some of the 'creative' decisions they did, can only have been through some kind of shared madness.This film failed on so many fronts. Joaquin Phoenix performed very well again and Gaga did OK too in that respect.Making it a musical though was just a stupid idea. I mean, it ain't exactly the fare of your typical Mamamia fan is it? What's the plan here: to make it into a stage show? If so, I'll be there for sure, on opening night: with a truck of rotten tomatoes. And Broadway shall become La Tomatina!At the start, you could kinda look past a couple of the songs as being momentary drifts into fantasy but before long, the pattern becomes apparent - that hackneyed lazy pattern - a tiny little plot development before... ah crap, I can feel another one coming - yep, repeated gratuitous pointless musical diversions that fail to progress the story or develop the characters but just serve to each add a few more minutes to the run-time.Even if we ignore the decision though, to hitch a farcical ride on the coat tails of LaLaLand, there were crimes that completely invalidate the worth of this movie, worst of which: writers broke canon so badly (I'm no comic book nerd fussing over details but these were no details) that this character simply was no longer Joker and Gaga's character really wasn't Harley Quinn.Joker, nemesis to Batman, is chaotic, frenetic, clever: crazy, yes but charismatic. But most of all, he is successful - an arch villain! The character in this movie lived and died without transcending 'sad loser' status. He certainly never came close to being an arch villain. He did a crime on TV, got famous and got caught - so what?Similarly his girlfriend was really just a saddo hybristophiliac - there was nothing brilliant about her, nothing special or 'beautifully twisted' she wasn't even particularly mental - just a little messed up, and a bit stupid.I'm not blaming the actors here, they played well but the characters were, all said and done, flimsy nobodies that bore no resemblance to their namesakes other than the most superficial of traits. Frankly, they were little more than stolen names.Thing is though, there were moments of opportunity, when it could all have been pulled back - when our doubt, that there was ever anything truly significant about these characters, could have been smashed, exploded, vaporised with a little twist in the plot. But no, it never came and in the end they were just a couple of insignificants who got their 15 minutes of fame in New York (Oops erm we mean Gotham, your honour) and faded away again.

Every time I got engaged, they'd start to brain-dead sing for 5 minutes and ruin the moment. Overdone and a movie killer.They are many ways they could've went with to make a good movie, and this was their best idea?Should've left the first one sequel-less. The ending was weird and lackluster. What the hell was that? I really wanted this to be at least decent, but nope. What a waste of time. 2+ hours of nothingness.If you enjoyed Joker then sadly you won't enjoy Joker: Folie à Deux. Don't watch it unless you get paid to do so :)\",\n",

And that's irritating to hear singing them in every 10 minutes. It's really disappointing how they make The Joker from best to worst. Wish I could get some more of that old Harley Quinn and Joker that I have been seeing from years, but that was nowhere near to that exotic and thriller duo we saw even into the cartoons, and also can't compare this movie to the first one. Joaquin phoenix was the main character of Joker, but In this it's all about Singing contest for Lady Gaga..\",\n",

The first Joker film was a masterpiece and one of my favorite films ever. But unfortunately, the scenes were ruined by musical performances, which just felt strange for this type of movie. I missed more acting, more dialogue. Joaquin Phoenix, as always, was absolutely fantastic in the role of Joker, and his acting was what lifted the movie. Lady Gaga actually did really well too, but it felt like the director had decided that because she was in it, everything had to be about singing. Lady Gaga doesn't need song and music; she is a really fine actress. So, all in all, I'm just super disappointed with this movie and had expected something entirely different.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"If Joker 2 was meant to expand on the tortured psyche of Arthur Fleck, it succeeded only in expanding my boredom. What made the first film so intriguing-the slow descent into madness-was replaced with a frantic, disjointed attempt to outdo its predecessor without any real sense of direction. Fleck's evolution (or lack thereof) feels more like a series of erratic, isolated scenes than a cohesive narrative.The film struggles to find its tone, oscillating between forced social commentary and a carnival of absurdity, leaving neither thought-provoking nor entertaining moments to cling to. It's as if the filmmakers believed that more chaos automatically equals more depth, but instead, it comes off as empty spectacle with none of the philosophical grit that made the original resonate. The character development was shallow, almost as if they hoped we wouldn't notice the lack of story under the avalanche of neon-lit chaos and ominous laughs.Joaquin Phoenix, ever the committed actor, did his best, but even his performance couldn't save a script that feels more like a checklist of provocations than an actual journey. Joker 2 is a poor imitation of its own predecessor, like trying to laugh at the same joke twice-only this time, it falls flat, and you're left wondering why you ever found it funny in the first place.Verdict? Skip this punchline.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'I wonder what the insurance was like on this film since every...single...scene contained at least one person smoking. Chances are, they had to do multiple takes with each performer smoking a pack and a half to nail the scene...This felt like an obligation movie. Like Writer/Director Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix were contractedly (and very begrudgingly) HAD to do a follow-up to their Oscar-winning/billion-dollar original. \"Fine, since you\\'re gonna make us do this, let\\'s ruin it by making it a musical\" I could hear them say.Also, this felt like it could work either way. It could be brilliant by making the sequel into a musical or the musical scenes could bring down the whole movie. Spoiler: it\\'s the latter.I could see maybe ONE fantasy scene play out with a song and dance on an obvious soundstage. Maybe two. Most of the movie, it didn\\'t work. And neither did their voices.I love Lady Gaga and her music. Not this time. She was awful. And maybe Phoenix isn\\'t a born singer. I almost want to give him the benefit of the doubt since again, it felt like he was trying to sabotage the film. He was even worse with his voice.What did work for me was the transition from depressed clown to slowly getting a smile on his face due to the introduction of Gaga\\'s Harley Quinn. I pretty much loved watching that spark grow. While this was nowhere at all entertaining as the entirety of the first movie, at least that was something to grasp onto during this disaster.Can\\'t wait to hear someone ask if you needed to see the 2019\\'s Joker. Well, you should anyways because that was 10x better. But, necessary? Not sure. They bring that movie up and its events as much as you see someone light up a cigarette. Again, that\\'s every scene.So, if you were to take away the musical segments, the smoking and the references to Part One, this would be 22 minutes, max. What would be left is those awesome character developing scenes of Joker getting life back into his chuckles.It\\'s easy to hate on this movie for making the daring, albeit terrible, choice of switching subgenres and making this a musical out of nowhere. If the songs were good, memorable or were sung well, I could easily forgive this decision. I left the theatre roughly 60 minutes ago and I can remember one line from one of the songs: I am that Joker, or something like that. Okay, I guess all songs/segments were pretty forgettable.I definitely praised Phoenix for his take on the Joker in #1. While he was still only my third favorite live-action take (Heath Ledger will remain my #1 and Jack Nicholson\\'s a solid second place,) Gaga\\'s Harley Quinn was meh. I will ALWAYS prefer Margot Robbie\\'s version. I understand this version and that doesn\\'t make it great.Was this a waste of time? Did I try and cancel my tickets all week? Is this a worthy follow-up to that fantastic first movie?Why yes, yes and no. Skip it.***Final Thoughts: I will give this movie\\'s opening a total thumbs up. I\\'m not sure why THAT wasn\\'t the whole movie. I mean, if they could ruin the first by making this a bad musical, they could\\'ve certainly go all-in with that very fun opening.',\n",

I do not think a single was necessary. The first one was the best if they would've kept it at that I would've been able to keep it legacy, adding a sequel only devalued it. It's not that I don't appreciate God's voice or I'm not a fan. Maybe she should not have to sing in every movie like use your acting chops and just act girl you got it.

Traditional musicals use the songs to progress the plot and keep the story moving, the songs in this film just paused the movie like an irritating commercial break.The first movie resonated a bit too powerfully with the most dangerous segment of humankind, historically. The main message was one of revolution: subvert the dominant paradigm, kill the rich. But there was also an incredibly poignant affirmation for sufferers of trauma, especially that suffered by the movie\\'s protagonist, and all too real and common in our society even if massively under-acknowledged.I believe (and as always I must add that I could be wrong), that the studio execs, themselves somewhat wealthy, but especially pressured by the owners of capital who finance those studios (and nearly everything else), compelled a formerly unremarkable and less-than well-established director to disempower the sequel by rendering it a boring yet confusing musical inanity with the intention of at least capping the momentum of revolution and the empowerment of solidarity felt by the disenfranchised outcast represented by the Joker character in the first film.Serious question: who is this made for?

That's exactly how I felt, every single scene that you see Lady Gaga she's singing or she'll eventually sing! There's no story, there's no strong script! It's not a movie it feels more like a show case for Jacquin Phonix and Lady Gaga to show people how good they are and indeed Jacquin Phonix rocket it again! He's an incredible actor but that is not enough to keep people in the cinema if things make no sense! Even though there was a huge potential to take the viewers deeper.Shoutout to Lawrence Sher with, great visuals, great lightning!\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I came into this film expecting the reviews to be wrong. The first film was an excellent description of the joker and his complex mind and I felt that the producers could live up to the climax of maintaining the quality of the old film but even build on it and make it better.However after a dragged out 2 hours and 18 minutes,which could have been shortened by a lot, I realised that the film was a no going col-de-\\nsac of pointless songs and pointless characters. The role of Harley Quinn was portrayed and poorly played by lady gaga. The highly rated actor Joaquin Phoenix followed a poorly written script which although he played well it ultimately led to a poor film which I would not recommend.In conclusion I felt this film was a poor sequel due to the fact that Turning a film about a phychotic lunatic which made a great first film into a musical which went nowhere and proved to be heavily disappointing should never have been done to the joker series. Even though the joker is a laughing lunatic he does not sing his heart out in a film about him as the two films have parallel opposite genres which I feel shouldn't be done\\nI would not recommend this film for any Joker lovers who expect this to be good and also cannot stress enough to people to not go into this movie expecting it to be good as it will be drastically disappointing to you.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"For the love of God, whatever you do, do not see this movie.I can't believe how much nothing happened. There was no action, no violence, no arc, no character development, no point, and no reason to have watched it. I'm mad at myself for contributing to its box office.As I got deeper into the movie, I started to think they must be building to something huge and cathartic, but I can't stress enough when reviewing this just how much of literally nothing is going on. If you can imagine Phoenix and Gaga standing in a dim room and singing under their breath to each other, you'll pretty much have the whole experience.I don't know how Todd Phillips' brain works, so I can't say whether my suspicion that he is just messing with the audience is accurate or not. But it definitely feels that way as the movie ploddingly lumbers up to the verge of having something happen, only for it to veer off into monotony.And frankly, even calling it monotonous is a compliment because there's certainly an argument to be made that the movie lacks even a mono-tone. Unless you count deliberate boredom as a tone.If an argument could be made that the last movie really didn't have anything to do with the Joker, this movie settles that issue definitively. You could take any movie, slap the word Joker on it and put some makeup onto the star's face, and it would have just as much claim to being a Joker movie as this does. If you slapped some clown makeup onto Tom Cruise and called the movie Top Gun: The Joker, it would be just as valid.The only reason it got three stars out of me is because everyone is a good actor, doing the best they can with a painful lack of material.\",\n",

Looks like he starved himself unless it is movie magic. The description of jukebox musical is appropriate as there is singing throughout and full numbers not just snippets. Kept waiting for action but it was far and few between and mostly flashbacks to the first Joker. Gaga was brought in for the singing as her acting is B movie quality and if you don't like her singing the movie becomes torture. It would have been more interesting if they did more with her character with a different actress. This ended up being more of a prison movie than anything else. Save your money.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux is perhaps the most textbook example to date of a film being less than the sum of its parts; it dances with very compelling ideas and themes, it bolsters incredible performances by an all-star cast, it is just as hauntingly beautiful in its cinematography as the first film, and the basic story premise is a compelling iteration upon the prior film at first glance. But alas, the ultimate assembly of this sequel in the form of the film we end up watching could not be any more disappointing and misguided. This movie is such a plodding, dull, unengaging, and boring viewing experience that lacks even the most basic fundamentals of cinematic pulse.I am in awe that a film of this scale with so much talent behind it could be squandered so severely. Part of me begins to wander if a superior edit of this film could exist, but it is useless to dwell on such what-ifs when the director himself affirms that this version of the film is his complete vision. An oddly large number of viewers do applaud this film based solely on the merit of what it attempts instead of what it actually achieves; to that, I say, if films were weighed based on their intent instead of their execution, then Tommy Wiseau's The Room would be an objective masterpiece instead of an ironic one.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker 2 was one of my most anticipated movies this year. The previews looked fantastic and thought this had the potential to be the best movie of the year. After seeing it today, it is battling Last Jedi for worst movie of all time.What a miserable film. It's basically watching a guy get treated terribly by everyone and I mean everyone. This film tries to punish him for his crimes to the point where the film itself is punishing him. It's like taking your least favorite toy and giving it nothing because you somehow hate it so much.The previews never advertise that it's a musical. Anything that resembles a musical is shown them on stage but nothing that will help you to that conclusion. I mean, I heard people walking out of the theater that they didn't know it was a musical.Some of these musical numbers are hit and miss, mostly miss and thankfully they are mostly performed in Joker's head. However, I start to realize the lack of story and these musical numbers are not only out of place and unnecessary, they are merely there to pad out the runtime.As usual, The Phoenix Brother delivered well for his 50 million dollar paycheck along with Lady Gaga. Brenden Gleason as the warden is also wonderful. The movie was also shot well. These are the only positives I can think of that kept me from scoring this film a one.It's just that it felt like a film that simply exists because the studio wanted another sequel this creating a Matrix Resurrections effect where everyone involved was either to spiteful to make this or too fearful of its target audience.\",\n",

To a truly tone-deaf musical which completely destroys the dark and sombre tones built by the rest of the plot.I understand the intention of using the musical scenes as a motif for Arthur's further descent into psychosis, but they feel so out of place that they mostly serve to break the immersion of the audience.The decision for the sequel to a dark, gritty, and depressing psychological thriller about a mentally ill man (and the society that failed to care for him, though the second never addressed this to the same degree as the first) to feature energetic big band musical sequences is so truly BAFFLING to me.I can't help but be frustrated by this movie. It feels like every time I was invested in a scene, the tension that was carefully built was immediately trainwrecked as Phoenix or Gaga spontaneously broke out into song, and I feel like hurling the closest object at the screen out of annoyance as I'm immediately brought out of Arthur's plight.I wish we could've seen this movie without these scenes.\",\n",

It lacked the depth and nuance you'd expect from a film that is supposed to delve into the psyche of such an iconic character. Instead, it felt like a waste of time, with scenes that dragged on without any real impact or significance. The whole movie lacked substance, and by the end, it felt like nothing had been achieved.

Some of the songs did make an impact but 80% of the music sequences just felt out of place and really paused any momentum the movie had, which wasn't much.Nothing really happened in this movie, it kind of felt like an unnecessary, added chapter to the end of the first movie, dragged out to a feature length film. I'm not sure who this movie was made for as it definitely wasn't made for the fans of the original movie, but I can't imagine it makes any new fans happy either.Anyone coming for Lady Gaga will be disappointed that she is not used very well or often and her story leads nowhere. Anyone coming for Joker (while an amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix) will also be disappointed with how his story unfolds as he doesn't have any agency in his own film and he is made out to be the joke of the film.The movie is visually beautiful and the performances by Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix are great, and the movie does have some really funny moments but these are not enough to save the film. I would not watch this movie a second time even though I have watched the first film multiple times.\",\n",

Such a disappointment compared to the previous Joker.This by itself was perhaps innovative from the perspective of some viewers and certainly worked in movies like Sweeny Todd with Johnny Depp. From my standpoint, it was an absolutely misguided decision that was worsened by Lady Gaga. Her portraying Harley Queen did just not appear believable. A popstar with one of the most notable voices in the world singing in an asylum choir? She did not have anything crazy about her except for trying to bring the Joker out of Arthur Fleck. Poor casting choice, there would have been so many alternatives. And the singing could have been cut short by almost every song. I strongly hope that the director never gives us a Batman movie, I already have nightmares of the Dark Night dancing like a Ballerina.Fair play to the display of personality disorders. The theme from the cartoon in the beginning was prevalent throughout the movie.The scenes in tue courtroom were poorly made compared to other decade-old but legendary pieces of movie history like 12 angry men.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker was a great movie. A one-off, almost art-house film that really didn\\'t need a sequel. I suppose you can admire director Todd Phillips for trying something different. It\\'s a prison/courtroom drama with a speck of (bad) romance. Oh, and it\\'s a musical too! It\\'s a bold move... But unfortunately, this uninspiring, tedious disaster of a movie just doesn\\'t work.What\\'s good about it? The performances from the lead and supporting cast are Oscar worthy. Erm, there\\'s also some nice cinematography but that\\'s about it. More scenes with Steve Coogan next time please!What\\'s wrong with it? Oh man, everything! The first movie was about Arthur Fleck\\'s tragic, tormented and disturbing journey of him becoming the Joker. This sequel has Joaquin Phoenix gone back to being Arthur Fleck, moping around in prison, only fantasising about being in full Joker make-up & suit while performing meaningless songs with his new girlfriend, Harley Quinn. Those of you who were expecting a full-on musical will be disappointed. The songs feel like an afterthought that was shoehorned in at the last minute. Maybe the film-makers realised what an absolute turkey this was going to be and thought \\'I know what to do, Lady Gaga can sing! Let\\'s give her some songs and get Joaquin Phoenix to mumble along with her. What a brilliant idea!\\' How about no! This is a terrible idea and it fails miserably. It only slows the pace of this already unentertaining and depressing movie and makes you worry about what dreadful ideas are possibly on the table for \\'The Batman Part II\\'.\"Let\\'s give the people what they want.\"\\nLady Gaga/Harley QuinnWell, it ain\\'t this dull, empty and lifeless monstrosity.

       "    'Review': 'Oh , where do I begin? Apparently, someone thought what the gritty, psychologically intense original *Joker* really needed was to become a *musical*. And not just any musical, but one that hijacks the plot halfway through, leaving you wondering if you walked into the wrong movie. Yes, some of the songs were catchy, but the strong plot from the first half takes a nosedive right when the singing starts. It\\'s like the film loses its way, trading tension and depth for showy dance numbers.Joaquin Phoenix, bless his soul, gives another outstanding performance as Arthur Fleck, showing consistency with the first film, even as the writing lets him down. But no amount of brooding intensity can save a character from poor writing and an overlong runtime. Lady Gaga? She was good, but with so little screen time, she never quite gets the chance to fully shine. It\\'s like they brought her in, had her belt out a couple of songs, and then decided to sideline her.And let\\'s talk about pacing. If the first half of the film has you intrigued, the second half might just have you falling asleep. This movie is unnecessarily long, stretching its thin plot to painful lengths. But, hey, at least the cinematography is gorgeous, right? The dark, haunting visuals and metaphors are almost enough to make you forgive the messy story. Almost.In the end, *Folie à Deux* is a muddled blend of musical missteps and slow pacing. Watch it at home if you must, but don\\'t waste your money on a theater ticket. After sitting through two-plus hours of this, I couldn\\'t help but think, \"At this point, we\\'re the clowns.\" But hey, you get what you deserve.',\n",

There is good production value, with great cinematography that makes the film pop, especially during some of the musical scenes, and Phoenix, along with Gaga, did good with the poor material that they had.However, the whole movie is a dull, tedious slog that hates it's own existence that fails in almost every way possible. It fails as a musical, with almost all of the musical numbers feeling dull and lifeless, and barely do anything to move the story forward, having no flow with the rest of the movie. It fails as a courtroom drama, as it fails to provide interesting perspectives on the dilemma the film focuses on, resulting in a shallow court case that's overly drawn.It fails as a sequel, spending so much of the runtime to tearing down the first movie that it fails to do anything else meaningful and new. And worst of all, it simply fails as a movie by having cynicism towards it's own existence and it's audience, resulting in an overly long whimper of a movie.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux had high expectations following the critically acclaimed original, but unfortunately, this sequel falls short in almost every regard. The film attempts to delve deeper into Arthur Fleck's psyche, but what was once a nuanced exploration of mental illness now feels more like a disjointed, overindulgent spectacle.First and foremost, the inclusion of musical numbers-an unexpected choice-ends up feeling jarring and out of place, disrupting the tone established by its predecessor. What worked for other genre-bending films ends up feeling forced here, as the contrast between Fleck's psychological descent and these surreal scenes is more confusing than compelling. Even with the talents of Lady Gaga, her portrayal of Harley Quinn feels underdeveloped, almost like an afterthought in the script, serving more as a caricature than a fully realized character.The film's pacing is another significant issue. It drags through long, meandering sequences that neither advance the plot nor build tension. While the original Joker was intense and engaging, Folie à Deux struggles to maintain momentum, frequently losing focus with repetitive scenes that try too hard to be provocative without saying anything new.Lastly, Joaquin Phoenix's performance-while still impressive-seems constrained by a script that doesn't know what to do with him. What should have been a deeper dive into his disturbed worldview instead becomes a rehash of the same ideas, leaving the character feeling stagnant and robbed of the complexity that made him compelling in the first place.Overall, Joker: Folie à Deux is a disappointment. It's a film that tries to blend genres and push boundaries but ends up feeling like a chaotic mishmash that's neither gripping nor thought-provoking. Fans of the original will likely be let down by this sequel that fails to justify its existence.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"This might be one of the hardest movie reviews I've written. I was shocked when every review for Joker: Folie à Deux came out negative, but after seeing it, I can understand why-especially when it comes to the ending.To start, every other part of this sequel is decent, although it's a bit of a departure, taking on the feel of a love story musical. While Joaquin Phoenix delivers a compelling performance, and Lady Gaga might just be the best Harley Quinn I've ever seen, the movie's heavy emphasis on dreamlike, musical sequences between Phoenix and Gaga caught a lot of people off guard. They spend a significant part of the film singing to each other, creating a surreal and often romantic atmosphere that's not what many fans were expecting.But while I didn't mind the musical direction, the film's real downfall lies in its brutal ending. Without giving anything away, it's extremely graphic and feels so unnecessarily gruesome that it leaves a bad taste after an otherwise decent experience. It's uncomfortable to watch and definitely not suitable for younger viewers.If you're planning to see Joker: Folie à Deux, go in with an open mind. There's a lot to appreciate, especially in the acting and musical approach, but prepare yourself-the ending is intense and could be off-putting for some.\",\n",

The worst thing about the sequel is how bored you are while watching everything that was and anything that could\\'ve been play out in front of you.The opening animation tells us, in Peter Pan fashion, that Arthur Fleck is part himself and part Joker. The rest of the film is tries to answer the question if Joker is schizophrenic or not, ultimately deciding whether he will receive the death penalty for the five murders he committed in the previous movie. Or is it to find out if he\\'s guilty? Surely he doesn\\'t have a chance at being freed. Does he plan on escaping prison? In the meantime he develops a romance with not Harley Quinn. Is this believable? No. But it has to happen to ultimately lead us...who knows.

But this is to be expected and only serviced me to not go completely insane myself with the meandering story that never evolved until the tedious ending which only serves to not wrap up anything, but proves there was nothing to wrap up other than telling you that the most honest part of the film was the first three minutes.

Doesn't go more than 15 minutes without breaking into song and dance the entire film. I have no clue why anyone thought it would be a good idea to make this into a musical. It tries to be edgy and alternative and as a result the movie is a steaming pile of rubbish. My favorite part was joker told lady gaga to stop singing. It was like he finally realized how God damned annoying it was. If I could choose to erase this movie from my memory, so I had only seen the first one I would.Wouldn't recommend this to anyone that is not also a fan of high-school musical.\",\n",

       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is the highly anticipated sequel to the critically acclaimed \"Joker\" (2019), directed by Todd Phillips. This film continues the story of one of the most iconic villains in comic book history, delving deeper into the psyche of its central character while exploring new themes and narratives.One of the standout features of \"Folie à Deux\" is its ambitious approach to storytelling. However, in my opinion, the plot feels underdeveloped; it remains in the background and fails to be either solid or particularly engaging. While the film expands on the psychological complexity, the end result does not fully capture attention as one might expect.Visually, the film maintains the striking aesthetic that characterized its predecessor. The work of cinematographer Lawrence Sher, combined with Phillips\\' direction, creates a dark and immersive atmosphere that enhances the emotional weight of the narrative. However, another aspect that negatively impacted my experience is the presence of musical elements. The stylistic shift from the first \"Joker\" is too evident, and these musical moments feel too abrupt and, at times, irritating.The performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga are consistently top-notch and undoubtedly represent a strong point of the film. Phoenix, reprising his iconic role, delivers a complex mix of vulnerability and intensity, while Gaga adds a new dimension to the story. Despite this, I feel the film is a missed opportunity; the performances of the two actors, while excellent, cannot support a plot that, in my view, fails to shine as it should.In summary, \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" positions itself as a thought-provoking exploration of its characters and the societal constructs surrounding them, but not without flaws. With its strong thematic elements and captivating performances, the film is poised to engage both fans of the original and newcomers, though I personally found it less compelling. While maintaining the profound psychological intensity of its predecessor, this sequel promises to take the story in new and unexpected directions, but it may not meet everyone\\'s expectations.',\n",

There are a few satisfactory moments that will likely resonate with Joker fans but for the most part the villain that is quite frankly larger than life and appreciated globally is severely underwhelmed and completely neglected. The only thing that had me on the edge of my seat was the unrewarded anticipation of the actual Joker's arrival. The character that is capable of unfathomable cruelty and maniacal ingenious is not present in this film.. Sad outing for one of the greatest. The biggest let down is that feature films for these type of characters are rarely produced, so to have wasted the opportunity is nothing but heartbreaking. Now that all the Joker character disappointment is assessed I will say the music, cinematography, and acting are top notch which can be expected from such a talented team.\",\n",

Where the original film captivated audiences with its gritty realism and compelling character study, this installment feels like a hollow attempt to recapture that magic.The decision to incorporate musical elements was baffling. Instead of adding depth to Arthur Fleck's fractured psyche, the sudden shifts into musical sequences feel jarring and out of place, detracting from the tension and atmosphere that defined the first film. Rather than serving as an artistic expression of his descent into madness, the choreography and singing come off as a disjointed spectacle that undermines the dark tone.Overall, Joker: Folie à Deux feels like a disappointing follow-up that tries to push boundaries but ends up lost in its own ambition. It's a film that confuses spectacle for substance and risks diluting the impact of the original by stretching a character study into something it was never meant to be: a spectacle of chaotic musical numbers and shallow melodrama.\",\n",

Instead of delivering the depth expected from a Joker movie, it felt more like a musical. It was a major letdown for Joker fans. They utterly dismantled the Joker character. The story was directionless and felt meaningless. Throughout the movie, I kept waiting for something to happen that would redeem the terrible plot, but nothing ever did. It left me deeply disappointed.The REAL JOKER character holds so much potential for deeper exploration. There are countless incredible films that could be made based on his complex life. Unfortunately, this film seemed more focused on profit, which led to its downfall. They reduced Joker to a filthy, pathetic man whose only hope lies in seeking sex and attention, and they dared to call that love. Seriously?!That said, Joaquin Phoenix's performance was outstanding, particularly in certain scenes, but even his brilliance couldn't save this film. At times, the music gave me goosebumps, just like in the first Joker movie, but it wasn't enough to redeem the overall experience.As for Lady Gaga's portrayal of Harley Quinn, her costume didn't really capture the essence of the character. Her acting was decent, but nothing memorable or particularly special.\",\n",

       "    'Review': '*\"Joker: Folie à Deux\"* may claim to explore the dynamic between Arthur Fleck and Lee, but in reality, it\\'s more of a one-man show. Lee\\'s character, who could have provided a compelling counterbalance, is completely sidelined in the second half as the film descends into an oddly misplaced courtroom drama. Any potential for a rich exploration of their relationship evaporates as the focus shifts back to Arthur\\'s repetitive internal conflict. The film flirts with the idea of duality-whether Arthur\\'s Joker persona is distinct from him-but exhausts the question long before the credits roll.The musical numbers are jarring and contribute little, with many sounding so similar that they only serve to drag the already sluggish narrative. They halt any momentum, leaving viewers unsure whether the film is a romance, a musical, a courtroom drama, or a critique of the justice system. In trying to be all of these things, it ends up being none, lacking any true sense of direction or purpose.Lee\\'s character could have added a fresh dynamic, but the script doesn\\'t give her the space to develop. Instead, she fades into the background, almost as an afterthought. By the end of its bloated runtime, the film leaves viewers questioning why it exists at all. Was it born from the massive success of the 2019 *Joker*? Possibly. But if that\\'s the case, this film takes every opportunity to squander that goodwill.A cast of incredibly talented actors, visually stunning set designs, and an atmospheric score are wasted in a story that has little to say. Todd Phillips seems determined to dismantle everything that made the original Joker compelling, leaving audiences wondering if this sequel\\'s purpose was merely to prove that lightning doesn\\'t strike the same place twice.',\n",

Instead of turning him into a cartoon villain, no pun intended, it instead portrayed him as a deeply disturbed individual who was given a very raw deal in life and how that put him into a spiral of violence and madness. This movie had an excellent opportunity to continue this progression and turn him into the diabolical Batman arch-enemy we all know he should be.But instead they made the asinine choice to turn it into a ehr... musical? For me such a choice could be only for one reason and that is to revert the expectations of the original fans and turn this movie into a joke, again no pun intended. Also, ignoring the boring musical parts, the movie just feels pointless. Half of the movie in an insane asylum and the other part in courtroom. Going back and forth trying to explain what he did in the first movie. But for what? We already saw the first movie and many felt it put Arthur Fleck into the path where he transcends his mortal form and become the immortal Joker. But this movie takes a u-turn and turns him back into Arthur Fleck and then ends his path in a brutal fashion.This is a terrible movie which seems to hate its prequel and want to undo it. So I recommend skipping this movie entirely and just re-watch Joker 1 and use your imagination on how he transformed into Joker.

       "    'Review': \"Okay, so I'm gonna get this straight, I never was particularly fond of this iteration of the Joker. Mostly because I'm a huge comic nerd and I can tell that the first movie wasn't so much of a deconstruction of the Joker character, but more so the exploration of a mentally ill man who just happens to refer to himself eventually as the Joker. Arthur Fleck is a deviation of the typical character and it's clear the Joker name was slapped on to get butts into seats. Beyond the name, it takes a lot of element from works evocative of Scorsese and smashes them down into a surprisingly basic and even somewhat generic story about someone falling into mental illness. Phoenix's performance is really what elevates the first film.That being said, at least they tried something here. Not only is Phoenix's performance and Ladu Gaga's vocals the only saving grace, there are far more glaring flaws this time around. The pacing feels absolutely mishandled, Lady Gaga's performance(and her overall character as Harley Quinn) falls extremely flat, albeit Gaga can sing her heart out. The film feels extremely contrived, ESPECIALLY towards the conclusion(for those who seen it, they know what I'm talking about) and for as much as the first movie tries to raise some decent talking points with some cohesion, this sequel in comparison feels like it isn't sure what it's trying to convey. So much potential, but the execution leaves so much to be desired. Not what I would've wanted after waiting five years for a follow-up on Arthur's story, but ultimately not shocked. Once I heard about it being a musical and Lady Gaga(excellent singer but mediocre actress) being the lead, my optimism flew out the window. The irony is that like the first movie, the title is meant to attract audiences and as you can tell from Gaga's casting, they were really trying to pull out the stops this time. But I have a gut feeling this sequel is not going to have the same impact on any level like it's predecessor did. 3 out of 10. Can't rate this any higher.\",\n",

Then something happened, ... and everything was already over!Acting was fine, but there was not much of a story, at least none that could not have been put into less then 40 minutes of movie time, and then move on with a story that probably everyone was waiting for.What a waste of time! I should have checked IMDb before spending money on the movie ticket, in fact I should have listened to my Spotify playlist instead.\",\n",

The only reason I even gave 3 stars were because the actors, not the movie! I won't spoil it for everyone who hasn't seen it but please do yourself and all of us a favor and DO NOT try to make a follow up, a comeback, a series, anything!

The director, in order to explain the nature of the Joker, ended up massacring one of the greatest characters ever seen in popular culture. Officially, from now on, the Joker is nothing more than a pathetic weakling who admits that he should have listened to the system. The character of the Joker as we know it after this film seems to have gone forever. Too bad.Anyway, the actors did a great job. Considering her lifestyle, Lady Gaga fits the character of Harvey very well. I think that all the burden of failure unfortunately lies on the director's back.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker Folie à Deux is a prime example of how a highly anticipated sequel can fall drastically short of expectations. While the film boasts impressive performances and a commendable musical score, it ultimately fails to deliver a coherent and engaging narrative.The Good (and it\\'s mildly good)Lady Gaga delivers a standout performance, showcasing her versatility as an actressThe musical elements are well-executed and add a unique flavor to the filmThe overall production value and cinematography are of high qualityThe Bad (and it\\'s really bad)The plot feels disjointed and lacks a clear directionThe film strays too far from the source, feeling more like a bait-and-switch than a true Joker storyThe movie feels like a missed opportunity. Instead of delving deeper into the Joker\\'s psyche while following the arc of the known story (for example how the Joker becomes more and more the known sociopath who perpetrates crime on a mass level) the film opts for a confusing and ultimately unsatisfying direction. It\\'s as if the creators used the Joker\\'s name solely for marketing purposes, much like the infamous \"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.\" The film\\'s departure from the established Joker lore is particularly frustrating. Fans hoping for an exploration of the character\\'s complex psychology and backstory will be sorely disappointed. What could have been a fascinating character study instead feels like a hollow travesty. While the musical aspects and performances are praiseworthy, they\\'re not enough to salvage the film\\'s fundamental flaws. It\\'s a shame to see such talent and potential squandered on a lackluster script and misguided creative decisions. Save your time and money for a more worthwhile cinematic experience.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker 2 revolves around the viewer getting an expanded look, into Arthur's disturbed an broken mind, while being incarcerated in prison, convicted of the five murders, we saw in the previous film.It's not often I go to the theatre to watch a film, but I found it fitting to go watch this, as the last time I went to the theatre was to watch the first one.I had beforehand decided to not watch any trailers and read as few reviews as I possible could, so I could get the full experience and not come in with an expectation.In hindsight I now wish I actually had, so I could have saved myself the $60 the two tickets cost.The film has issues - many issues.The first and probably the most obvious one, is the artistic detour the writers, producers and Todd Phillips in the direction chair took.I'm baffled about the how and why they decided it was a good idea, to turn the now franchise into a musical. And at that point, not even a great one. While I can see it was an attempt to capture Arthur's broken mind, it could have been done in so many other ways, which could have worded a lot better.What we were presented with, is a prolonged Lady Gaga Music Video.The character development is lazy and quite frankly both Arthur and Lee come off as terribly boring. Lee barely has much to say in the film, and the lines she does have doesn't really offer much to the development of the characters over all.When it comes to Arthur, there is very little of him left in him. While I can accept that as a starting point of the film, had it revolved in him going back to his prime time as the Joker, it just never happened. Through out the film, we are met by the same empty and boring character with none to very little development.When Arthur finally has the chance to shine, it's like seeing a totally different person, besides Arthur or the Joker.When it comes to the story and the setting, the movie lacks a lot of the gritty setting and suspension the first film had. In many ways what we were left with was boring and I sat through out the film waiting for something to happen, that just never came.There was way too many artistic freedoms taken in this film and I don't really find many of them a work of a genius.For now, I shall forget this movie exist and just enjoy, that we at least have the first one and it actually details Arthur's descending into The Joker.\",\n",

His lawyer Maryanne is trying to prove Arthur has dissociative identity disorder and Joker is his split personality in order to prove his mental illness. Harleen confesses her admiration of Joker to Arthur and how she relates to him the most. This leads to him falling in love with her while his trial begins. Maryanne wants to prove Arthur Fleck as innocent whereas Harleen wants Arthur to embrace Joker completely. What happens when Arthur tries to stop his shadow aka Joker, forms rest of the story.Todd Phillips and team have come up with a thin storyline to be stretched into sequel and turning this into a musical helps in increasing the runtime. However, the world of Arthur\\'s fantasy and his reality, though filmed well, doesn\\'t really clash together in the way intended. Lady Gaga was born to play Harleen Lee Quinzel but sadly her role is poorly written. Credit goes to Lady Gaga for elevating her character. Joaquin Phoenix continues his act from Joker and though he looked a bit less convincing in the songs, he made it up in the key scenes. It was the messed up final act and that \"climax\", that derailed the film entirely. With a threadbare storyline, it was always going to be an uphill task to match the far superior prequel.',\n",

I felt bad for him to work here. Hopefully he got his bag cause he's not the one to blame for this mess.Todd Phillips you created a masterpiece in 2019 and sabotaged it on purpose. You got your pay check and could've at least tried to make a good sequel like a Joker & Harley Bonnie & Clyde movie or something. Joker 2 has no story, no development and gives me nothing for my money. It's one thing to punish Warner, but a horrible thing to do that to the people that actually pays for that. Warner still gets money for that so it makes no sense to f up this movie. I trusted you because of Old School, War Dogs & Joker, but this sequel puts DC's most popular character in the absolute worst spotlight ever and I'll never forgave you for that. Unlike others I don't think the musical aspect was an issue although it haltered the movie and overstretched it to find its pace.Joaquin PhoenixHit and miss actor. Fabulous work in the first movie and the only thing I can here blame him for is saying yes to this terrible movie.Lady Gaga\\nShe's not a good actress for me, but she really tried and was pushing to get something out of this movie.

With stars like Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, I was hoping for an intense and profound portrayal of the Joker-a character known for his dark, complex, and psychopathic nature.While Phoenix and Gaga give solid performances, the film falls flat in delivering the story we all wanted. Instead of diving deep into the Joker's twisted psyche, we're given an odd mix of musical numbers and dance sequences that feel out of place, often popping up every few minutes without any real purpose. The Joker's torment, his darkness, and his complexity-all of that is missing.What makes it worse is that we all know this isn't the *real* Joker from the comics or earlier films. But even with that freedom, the movie wastes the potential to explore the more psychological, chaotic side of the character. Instead, we're left with a shallow version of what could've been a gripping dive into madness.The supporting characters, like Harley Quinn (played by Gaga), are equally underserved. Instead of playing into their notorious, toxic dynamic, her character feels one-dimensional, with little depth to their connection. The lack of meaningful interaction between the Joker and figures like Murray Franklin or even Arkham inmates drains the story of any tension or intrigue.It's a real shame because, with the right direction, this could've easily been one of the best films of the year. Instead, it's a disappointment. Save yourself the time and money-this one doesn't live up to the hype.\",\n",

I kept waiting in anticipation thinking this must be building towards some big moment that unfortunately never arrives, and instead was left with nothing but disappointment as the movie ends on a worse note than it began.I was on the fence when I watched the trailer, but now having seen it I kind of wish I wouldn't have.

Like many, I was skeptical about turning the Joker story into a musical, though I was willing to give it a fair shot. Unfortunately, the film falls short in several key areas.The musical aspect, intended to give insight into the Joker's psyche, quickly becomes overdone and tedious. While the songs could have been an interesting way to explore the character's inner world, they focus almost exclusively on the love story between Joker and Harley Quinn, missing an opportunity to delve deeper into his madness. There's one brief moment-10-minutes in a scene (where the Joker also sings about something other than love)- that captures a glimpse of the eccentric madness from the first film. For that short stretch, the movie shows what it could have been, but it ultimately slips back into disappointment.The overuse of scenic shots, an excessive focus on a fictional trial that takes up a third of the movie, and the endless musical numbers make the film feel drawn out. By the end, I was eager for it to finish. Despite my best efforts to play devil's advocate, I left the theater completely aligned with the wave of criticism.The only real highlight is the performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, who fully commit to their roles as Gotham's infamous crime couple.

But here, all those criticisms are made a lot more valid. The way it tries to empathise and criticize its protagonist is so dumb, and it doesn't exactly seem like the same character from the first one the way a lot of decisions are made. Lady Gaga's character is written as a template serial killer lover and nothing more even though she tries her best. So, naming that character Harley Quinn is such a disservice considering the history of that character.A lot of the movie takes place in a courtroom and jail. In both of these areas, there are just a lot of things that don't make sense. The cops and lawyers in this movie say and do things that don't make any sense considering what they actually want from doing it. The Joker says a lot of things that amount to nothing while in the first movie, all of his rants and comedy had a cinematic purpose.Considering they went for a musical, the movie had a lot of chances to be a lot more than it is even with its nonsensical paper-thin plot but they don't commit to it. And ending the movie abruptly like that, when the previous scene would've been enough just to reduce the drama of that event is so dumb. I mean, this is supposed to be a musical and such a big thing is presented in such a bland way?The choice to be a musical and the ending are supposed to be the polarizing aspects of the movie. But I enjoyed the musical aspect and the ending being so bland is more of the issue than the choice to do that considering how the rest of the movie went. Overall, it's technically well-made but has a weak script. It should've been utterly boring if not for the atmosphere that it sets for the movie. Nonetheless, such a bad sequel.\",\n",

The first movie was not perfect but it is still good and it was my favourite movie of the 2019. However, this movie preferred to take all that and make a high school musical with the Joker and Lady Gaga. The main problem is not that the movie is a musical; the problem is the empty story with a slow rhythm that makes the movie feel like an eternity. Lady Gaga's perfomance is very lazy and boring like her character and Joaquin Phoenix seems zero interested in this movie. The music is very forgettable and the choreographies are poor and unexciting. Also, the worst part of this movie is the ending because it seems that the director wanted to mock his fans. This was my second disappointment of this year (the first was the crow )\",\n",

I'm confused if we even got any further than the first movie.It kinda felt like 40 small trailers stitched together.A shot here. Cut. Black screen. And a new shot there.

And it's okay but don't have what felt like an hour of bad singing.It kinda felt like watching a badly made Wes Anderson movie. The way that the movie gave room for these musical performances to take place in a different time and place. But these performances are not well connected enough to justify there relevance for the movie.There wasn't a lot of depths to the characters.But Phoenix was great.My first thought on my mind: it's nothing to celebrate.My conclusion is that I found more joy watching 65. And that's a movie about a man and a little girl who screams for the full duration of that movie.\",\n",

       "    'Review': '\"Joker 2\" is, in many ways, an unnecessary sequel that never should have existed, reflecting the greed of a Hollywood studio seeking awards and box-office profits. I entered the theater with low expectations and reluctance, despite loving the original, mainly due to the inclusion of musical numbers, which could easily fall flat as they don\\'t fit the tone. Surprisingly, the first hour entertained me, and I thought, \"Well, it\\'s not as good as the original, but it\\'s not as bad as I expected,\" even with the evident excess of songs. However, my optimism was misplaced as that initial positive impression quickly crumbled as the film dragged on without any clear direction.The movie stretches on to the point where it feels repetitive, with most scenes taking place in the prison and courtroom, locations that quickly become tiresome and lacking in visual or narrative innovation. There was nothing impactful, no personal drama that made me want to engage with the story. \"Joker 2\" stalls more than a poorly rolled joint that never lights as it should.Another major issue lies with the characters. The Joker, brilliantly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in the first film, appears here as a hollow version of himself. There is no emotional or psychological development that does justice to the character\\'s complexity. While the first film showcased a downward spiral culminating in violence and chaos, here, the Joker lacks life and purpose. He moves slowly, directionless, as if lost within the plot. For such an iconic character, this is unforgivable.Lady Gaga is an excellent actress and singer, but she didn\\'t convince me as Harley Quinn. The problem isn\\'t her talent, which is undeniable, but rather the writing surrounding her character, which fails to make her memorable. In my opinion, this is the worst portrayal of Harley Quinn, wasting her talent, especially considering what Lady Gaga is capable of.Technically, there\\'s nothing to criticize about \"Joker 2.\" The cinematography, art direction, and sound are all impeccable, which only makes it more frustrating that the film offers nothing new narratively and, worse, leads us nowhere. Ultimately, it feels like a parade of stylized scenes and cliched lines, designed for sharing on Tumblr.One last thing: the $200 million budget is a mystery. Where did all that money go? The film mostly takes place in the same settings, lacking significant action moments or special effects to justify such an investment. I got the impression that most of that budget went to Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga\\'s salaries because, honestly, there\\'s not much else to justify it.As for the musical moments I dreaded, I have to admit they turned out better than I expected, but that doesn\\'t mean they work well. They often feel forced, as if hastily inserted to give the film a different identity, but they end up disrupting the pace and, in many cases, making the experience even more tedious.In summary, \"Joker 2\" can be visually stunning and technically charming, but it\\'s ultimately a completely unnecessary and weak sequel. It adds nothing new to the universe that the first film so effectively built and stands as another example of a terrible continuation of a great film, much like \"American Psycho 2.\" Its existence, like the narrative it presents, simply lacks purpose.',\n",

I had no expectations on the film or plot.I thought even if this ends up being a court room musical (as ppl were claiming) - that tbh sounded great. I love musicals and broadway. I have (and loved) working at a real courthouse. This honestly sounded like a dream sequel.Despite this - The movie isn't bad, but it sure isn't good. The movie is a bit too pretentious for its own good. It also does Lady Gaga no favors. The music was not good, nor was it supposed to be.The plot isn't even awful, it's just so incredibly slow bc of the music. The music did not add a ton to the plot, and that is problematic. In the first film his delusions added to the plot. The singing added to the plot but by the 4th-5th-6th songs the point was beyond made. Cool this is what yall wanted? Then yah, expect to flop. And when ppl who love musicals still don't like it, ya know it's a true flop.The first movie will remain a standalone and a stellar one at that. I truly like the idea of what they were going for here but it just wasn't done well at all.Also, a film that purposely tries to piss ppl off isn't ever good for business. And yes, this is a business. I wouldn't pretend otherwise. It's okay to like this film. It's also okay to not like it. It's not bad. But it's also not great.\",\n",

The potential for greatness is there, buried somewhere in the concept, but it never fully materializes.I think the idea of focusing on a trial could have worked. In fact, it might have been better suited as a limited series, giving the narrative room to breathe and develop.

So lets use her singing talent to let her sing as much as possible...The first hour, the movie builds up and could be a great intro to finally action from the Joker. The first hour of the movie, i would give it a 8+. But somehow the story writers probably thought; lets not make it a Joker movie after a hour. Lets just make it a court movie with a person who thinks he is the Joker and a woman that thinks she is Lee( she dresses way to nice to come close to the character). For me the movie was really good till the part when Arthur and Lee go out the prison due to a fire. But then the movie turns into a theatre show. With way to much singing, you could hear the people in the cinema sigh when one of the persons start singing again after that part. We expected finally to see the real Joker and the chemical relation with Lee. What was building up till that fire.The way how the movie was shot, the quality of the characters are high and the setting in the movie is great. But....It is save to say, the movie is not what it should be and it is a waste of the crew that played in this movie.

All Todd Phillips did was perform, failing to truly evolve the character. Even he didn\\'t build the \"folie à deux\" state that the title promises. The carefully crafted Scorsese and Dark Knight references in part one were wasted, abandoned for a questionable new direction. The original film\\'s gritty realism and psychological depth seem at odds with a musical format, risking the loss of what made the first film so compelling. By shifting genres so dramatically, Phillips may alienate the audience who connected with the original\\'s dark character study.

Was I teletransported to a High School Musical (for grown ups), multiverse?The whole movie, was boring.. I mean, after each scene with a dialogue, you had to endure a music.. i think it was like 15 songs, or something like that.After watching the first Joker, this, burned my eyes. Why did they even do this?It felt like, I was watching a Lady Gaga concert, and Joker was her side kick.Joker\\'s character, was ruined. The script, lead his actions into something, that the character of the first movie would never do, or act like.The same goes for this \"Harley Quinn\" which acts nothing like the original Miss Quinn from the comics (or DC Universe). She does all the opposite things HQ would do.This could be other character, but never a Harley Quinn.. more like a random crazy pseudo fan chick, who likes to sing.After all that time enduring the musical moments (which I really want to fast forward with a control remote, but I couldn\\'t because I was in a cinema), we still have to deal with an absurd ending.Two facts: This movie was a huge Lady Gaga concert;\\nThe movie itself, meant to ruin Joker.Regarding the performances, Joaquin Phoenix was great, he did the best he could, following this horrible script.Regarding Gaga, she looked more like herself, after all, she is a singer.And this is it.. if you are still curious, go watch this.But don\\'t tell me, you hadn\\'t been warned!',\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': 'Big Disappointment',\n",
       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is a significant departure from the original \"Joker\" (2019), both in tone and execution, leaving some audiences disappointed. While the first \"Joker\" was celebrated for its gritty, realistic portrayal of mental illness and societal collapse, the sequel ventures into a musical direction that feels disjointed and lacks the same emotional depth. The shift to musical numbers with Lady Gaga\\'s Harley Quinn disrupts the raw intensity that made the original so impactful, leaving viewers feeling disconnected from the story.The narrative is muddled, and it often feels like style is prioritized over substance. While Joaquin Phoenix still delivers a strong performance, the overall impact is less striking. The original Joker\\'s chaotic descent into madness was grounded in a sense of grim reality, but the sequel\\'s fantastical elements undermine that realism, making it difficult to take seriously.Comparing it to Deadpool and Wolverine, it\\'s clear \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" falls short. DAW is known for its sharp wit, tight storytelling, and balance between humor and action. Even when it\\'s absurd, \"Deadpool\" stays self-aware and keeps its audience engaged. With Wolverine joining, fans experience dynamic, exciting action and a strong emotional core. \"Joker 2\" tries to be bold with its musical experiment, but it doesn\\'t land as well, lacking the entertainment value and consistent tone found in something like \"DAW\"On the other hand, \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" seems to miss out on this broad appeal. Its attempt at being more experimental with the musical elements may alienate viewers looking for the gritty realism that made the first Joker so impactful. While \"DAW\" is likely to ride the wave of fan service, humor, and nostalgia, \"Joker 2\" lacks that same broad draw. Even with big names like Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, its stylistic choices may be too niche to reach the same massive commercial success.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Five years. That\\'s how long I waited, eagerly anticipating the next chapter in Arthur Fleck\\'s dark, twisted journey that shook the world with Joker (2019). The first film was a masterpiece - gritty, raw, unapologetically real. People connected to it on a visceral level. But after seeing Joker: Folie à Deux, my one overwhelming thought was: Why, Todd? Why?The film had so much potential, but what we got was a chaotic mess, completely out of touch with what *Joker* had originally set up. Let\\'s break it down:Lackluster Storytelling: Where was the story? There was no cohesion, no forward momentum. The film felt like it was rambling, disconnected. *Joker* 1 had us gripped in Arthur\\'s descent into madness, but here? It felt like they just stitched together random scenes. There were no stakes, no real suspense, no build-up. Instead, we were left wondering what happened to the raw, unfiltered tension from the first film.The Musical: Completely Off Track: I get it - musicals are a bold move, but this one? It just didn\\'t fit. The entire concept felt like an unnecessary distraction, completely out of sync with the grim world that *Joker* inhabits. Lady Gaga is incredible - no doubt. She was probably the best part of the film, but the musical element didn\\'t mesh with the gritty, psychological intensity that made Joker so captivating in the first place. Instead of adding depth, it came off as pretentious and forced.Where\\'s the Cinematic Brilliance?: Joker 1 was visually stunning. The cinematography had a purpose - every shot, every angle told a story. *Folie à Deux*? Not so much. The visuals felt bland and uninspired. There was nothing that made me sit up and say, \"Wow, this is a work of art.\" It was as if they forgot the very essence of what made Joker so visually engaging.No Dialogues: Where were the sharp, thought-provoking dialogues that Joker was known for? The first film had lines that stuck with you long after the credits rolled. In Folie à Deux, there wasn\\'t a single line that stood out. The film left no lasting impact in terms of narrative or dialogue. It\\'s like they completely missed the point.Music That Didn\\'t Hit the Mark: And then there\\'s the music. What happened? The score of Joker 1 was haunting, a perfect reflection of Arthur\\'s psyche. In Folie à Deux, the music didn\\'t add to the atmosphere - it detracted from it. Nothing about the score felt like it belonged in the world of *Joker*. It lacked intensity, lacked emotional resonance, and ultimately left me detached.A Disappointing Direction: I can\\'t help but feel this film was made simply to cash in on the success of the first one. It felt rushed, like no one really cared about crafting a meaningful story. Todd Phillips delivered a piece of art in *Joker* 1, but here, it feels like he lost his way. Was this film even necessary? Did anyone ask for this? The brilliance of *Joker* didn\\'t need a sequel, especially not one like this.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'It was expected that the sequel to \"Joker\" would struggle to reach the same depth and impact as the first film. The 2019 original, directed by Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Phoenix, made waves with its dark, psychological tone, offering a unique take on the villain\\'s origin story. However, in \"Joker: Folie à Deux,\" Phillips seems to have lost his way, delivering a sequel that, while it has some interesting elements, feels disconnected and, at times, soulless.The first thing that stands out is the change in tone. While \"Joker\" explored an oppressive and decaying Gotham through a raw, almost realistic lens, \"Folie à Deux\" mixes elements of musical, courtroom drama, and a touch of fantasy, creating a film that seems undecided about what it wants to be. The inclusion of musical numbers-a bold and, in theory, promising idea-ends up being one of the film\\'s biggest missteps. Instead of organically blending into the narrative, the songs feel like jarring interruptions, flashy distractions that don\\'t really advance the plot or deepen the characters.The relationship between Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) and Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga)-the future Harley Quinn-is one of the central aspects of the story. However, this dynamic, which could have been fascinating and layered, ends up being shallow and predictable. Gaga, who\\'s already proven her talent in films like \"A Star Is Born,\" seems limited by a script that doesn\\'t give her much room to shine. Gaga\\'s Harley is less vibrant and eccentric than the version popularized by Margot Robbie, which could have been an interesting approach if the film knew what to do with this more restrained take. Unfortunately, her character ends up as a shadow of the anti-heroine we know, defined more by her obsession with Arthur than by her own motivations.As for Joaquin Phoenix, always intense and committed to his roles, he tries to bring depth to a character who, in this sequel, feels lost. Arthur is more beaten down, more disillusioned, and the film tries to convey this visually with a gray, oppressive cinematography. The problem is that, no matter how much Phoenix tries, the script doesn\\'t give him much to work with. The lack of clarity about Arthur\\'s intentions and emotional journey makes it hard for the audience to connect with him in a meaningful way. In \"Joker,\" Arthur\\'s arc was clear: a broken man, marginalized by society, slowly descending into madness. Here, that trajectory is muddled, without direction.The biggest problem with \"Folie à Deux,\" however, is the sense that everything is happening out of obligation. The film feels like it was made more out of pressure to continue a successful franchise than out of a genuine creative need. There\\'s a noticeable frustration in how the ideas are executed-it\\'s as if Phillips is trying to make a subversive film but doesn\\'t fully believe in his own choices. The visual and narrative references, which in the first film evoked Scorsese and 70s cinema, here turn into hollow pastiches, lacking the same impact or purpose.And it doesn\\'t help that the film\\'s pacing is sluggish. The long trial of Arthur, which should have been the emotional and narrative core of the plot, ends up being tedious and repetitive. There are moments where it feels like we\\'re stuck in an endless loop of courtroom scenes that go nowhere, while the potential to explore Arthur\\'s mental state-and how it influences his perception of reality-is only superficially touched upon.In the end, \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is more of a missed opportunity than a true continuation. The film tries to be many things at once-musical, psychological drama, social commentary-but doesn\\'t succeed in any of them. The lingering feeling is of a director unsure of what he wants to say or where he wants to take his characters, delivering a film that, despite strong performances and competent production design, ends up being frustrating and disappointing. If the first \"Joker\" was like a love letter to dark, disturbing cinema, \"Folie à Deux\" is like the creative hangover, trying to find its way but tripping over its own ambitions. Which is a shame.',\n",

Nothing really happens, there is no tension and the audience doesn't really have a reason to feel one way or the other about the message the film is giving.The court room scenes aren't interesting and the musical numbers don't seem to advance the narrative which makes them frustrating when considering the whole package.This is a very unfortunately sequel that did nothing to enhance or preserve the legacy of the excellent first film.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker: Folie A Deux (2024) :\\nMovie Review -After the blockbuster success of Joker (2019), Todd Phillips is back with a direct sequel, \"Joker: Folie A Deux.\" This time, the joker is not alone. Arthur Fleck is not alone anymore. He has found someone to love, and he doesn\\'t want to die. Lee, aka Harley Quinn, completes him; she \"gets\" him. \"She\\'s really something,\" says Arthur, and why not because she\\'s the only one who understands him, saying, \"He is not sick. He is perfect. Together, we are gonna build a mountain from a little hill.\" Now back to Joker\\'s climax and its psychologically disturbing characteristics, I asked myself, \"Did such a dark and intense story deserve a follow-up like this, I mean, the one filled with love, courtroom drama, and musicals?\" My heart said, \"Maybe yes,\" but my brain said, \"Maybe No!\"The film begins with mentally disturbed and nihilist Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) in jail, with his inner bones clearly showing up touching his external skin. This jail life was worse than the world outside-maybe that\\'s what they wanted to portray from Arthur\\'s point of view. He sees Lee (Lady Gaga) in a music room, and they create an instant attraction towards each other. Meanwhile, Fleck is going through medication and counseling, and his lawyer, Ms. Stewart (Catherine Keener), is trying to prove that he suffered through split personality disorder at the night of the crime. Lee is freed, and she goes on to give interviews about Fleck being a \"perfect\" guy to live in society, and then the trial begins with Harvey Dent (Harry Lawtey) fighting the case as an assistant district attorney. Will Arthur win the case? That\\'s what the film is all about in the second half.Frankly, I believe, the story of The Joker should have never become a love story or a courtroom drama, and here it becomes both. That wasn\\'t sensible at all. Yes, it doesn\\'t make sense to see a criminal who killed a person on a live show and five other people, trying to prove that it wasn\\'t him after all. Even a medical term like personality disorder can\\'t be an excuse in this case, as it was in Anniyan (2005). Moreover, seeing a morally disturbed and criminally advanced Joker as a puppet and a silent bully of the class doesn\\'t do justice to the image people have in mind. In the pre-climax scene, Joker sees a complete shift in his own mindset just after a sexual abuse by the guard. Similarly, Quinn\\'s obsession for the Joker, having a baby, and then abandoning him all happen so fast that you don\\'t see them as concrete reasons to carry the story. In short, it\\'s a \"love got him down\" kind of scenario, which has been in Hollywood since the 1930s in many gangster dramas, but instead of a femme fatale touch, Joker 2 is driven by guilty consciousness, dark blue nihilism, and personality conflicts. I still don\\'t understand, \"Why would Arthur even kiss his lawyer twice?\" Most of the musical numbers and crazy scenes I imagined from the trailer, turned out to be dream sequences, and a few were not there at all. Too much disappointment to Kitty!Performance-wise, it was a good show. Joaquin Phoenix stunned us all with his act in Joker, and he did it again in Joker 2. It\\'s just that the character has no graph and no soul this time, so it feels dry. The blood, the liquidated feel of that anger-everything was missing. Lady Gaga surprises as Harley Quinn-not very much to what we expected from the promos. She was looking promising from the pre-release movie clips already, and she delivers. A no-sorry female antagonist who doesn\\'t even care about her boyfriend who has finally turned yellow-oh yes, we don\\'t see such ladies in our movies often. Brendan Gleeson is that brutal guard in the jail, and be is awesome. Catherine Keener as a lawyer, Zazie Beetz as Sophie (a cameo), and Harry Lawtey as Dent, all have done fine in those small roles. Steve Coogan and dwarfy Leigh Gill add good support.Why would anyone want to make a Joker\\'s sequel a musical? I don\\'t understand. Joker: Folie A Deux\\'s musical numbers didn\\'t entertain me much the way that one scene from \"The Band Wagon\" (1953) did. Gaga singing the same lines or any other song would get my thumbs up any other day, but not today. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher was impressive. That smile with lipstick on a mirror and the top view of the four different color umbrellas taking Arthur in jail or all those dreaming musical sequences-Sher has done brilliant camerawork. Joker was conceived as a standalone film, and Joker 2 literally ends the saga-too quickly! The screenplay is boring and slow, which makes you feel sleepy (believe me, I felt so). The production design was fine, and the sound was well mixed, but nothing noticeable. I can\\'t even imagine that Todd Phillips directed a \"banger\" like \"Joker,\" and now he is the same person who directed a \"blunder\" like \"Joker: Folie à Deux.\" It\\'s just not acceptable. He hasn\\'t just disappointed the fans with this sequel but also destroyed the image of Joker created by Phoenix and himself only. Can\\'t believe how someone can really make a boring and meaningless sequel like this to a modern classic like \"Joker\" (2019). I wish it wasn\\'t \"true,\" and I could forget it as a \"fantasy.\"RATING - 4/10*',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Arthur Fleck, is now confined to a cold, isolated cell in Arkham asylum after his infamous crimes. His isolation feels endless until Dr. Harleen Quinzel, a psychiatrist with her own dark past, enters his life. Arthur, now fully embracing the Joker persona, speaks to her unresolved memory of watching her father stabbing her mother to death. He reveals that only by surrendering to chaos has he found peace and a sense of true freedom.As Harley listens, her curiosity turns into a dangerous fascination. She's drawn to his unfiltered honesty, the way he speaks about rebellion with a passion that lights up her own repressed darkness. The boundaries she once held firm blur; she becomes promiscuous, losing herself in strangers' arms. Her husband watches helplessly as she spirals-she cuts their children's hair in a grotesque display, tattoos her face, and paints their home in a manic frenzy. When he finally throws her out, she feels nothing but liberation. She is no longer Harleen Quinzel; she is Harley Quinn, Arthur's loyal priestess and the orchestrator of his revolution.Harley organizes protests and rallies, channeling her newfound madness into a growing movement. What begins as a grassroots rebellion against society's cruelty evolves into a full-fledged gang. She becomes the engineer behind the Joker's uprising, transforming the city with her fiery passion.Meanwhile, Arthur's trial looms. The lawyers want to plead insanity, but Arthur refuses-he insists Arthur Fleck is dead. Firing his legal team, he represents himself, bringing the people who failed him to the stand. One by one, he exposes the social worker who abandoned him as a child, the shrink who didn't care, and the show secretary who set up the cruel TV ambush with Murray. The climactic moment arrives when Harley herself takes the stand, declaring their twisted love with a devotion so raw and impassioned that it stuns the courtroom.The jury, moved or manipulated by the Joker's performance, delivers a shocking verdict: not guilty. Arthur walks free, and his victory feels like a triumph for every lost soul in Gotham.Years later, the Joker has become a cultural phenomenon. He runs a controversial podcast, captivating millions with his unapologetic and incendiary rhetoric. He even announces a run for office, his growing base of loyal followers sees him as a messiah. When his political ambitions are mocked and ridiculed, he retreats to the shadows, unleashing his criminal organization in full force. Harley, his ever-loyal queen, stands beside him as they take down corrupt politicians and mobsters, creating a dark legacy that shakes Gotham to its core waiting for his nemesis to come out of the shadows.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I went into the new Joker film with high hopes, but unfortunately, it didn't deliver. For the first time in my life, I actually fell asleep in the cinema - twice! The movie was painfully slow, with almost no real story to grab onto. The pacing was so off that I found myself just waiting for it to end, hoping that my own boredom would end with it.They really messed up what should've been a masterful scene, making it feel lackluster instead of gripping. Lady Gaga's voice was the only saving grace, adding a touch of quality to an otherwise underwhelming film. While it's clear the cinematography was well-executed, the film's visuals couldn't make up for the lack of substance.Overall, it felt like a beautifully shot, but ultimately hollow, movie. I couldn't wait for the credits to roll so I could escape my misery.\",\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': 'Mismatch of Audiences is a Failed Experiment',\n",
       "    'Review': 'I don\\'t have any statistics, but it is my hunch that the kind of audience that likes to watch dark and bloody thrillers don\\'t like musicals. Conversely, I would be surprised if people who go to movies like \"La La Land\", would be willing to sit through a tough movie about a killer in prison. The first Joker movie was produced as though it was a Martin Scorsese film, and it was a revelation (see my review). The filmmakers back then had no intention of producing a sequel. While watching the sequel, I analyzed the story structure. Fleck is now in jail and is preparing for trial. That is not enough story to fill a two hour movie. Even with the introduction and pairing up of Joker and Harlequin in this movie, momentum is stunted while Fleck remains in prison.For a more engaging story, all the events that happen later in this film should all be packed into the first act. The story I think audiences wanted was for Joker to break out of prison, begin his crime spree, and witness his transformation into the Joker we all know and love from \"The Dark Knight\".I wonder if the director and screenwriter asked himself \"What would Marty Scorsese do?\". (I suppose he could call him and actually ask him). Well, Mr. Scorsese actually made a musical very early in his career called \"New York, New York\", with Robert Deniro and Liza Minelli. It is not considered one of his stronger works and thus I have never bothered to watch it. But I doubt there is any similarity to Joker 2. I believe when the filmmakers were tasked to make a sequel, another angle was sought to make it worth their while.Hence, for the sake of adding more to the thin story, and to utilise a vehicle for their creative efforts, it became a musical. I don\\'t like musicals. But I was unsure what my reaction would be to this strange mix of a film, so I gave it a chance. I can\\'t help but bring up the Coppola movie \"Megalopolis\", which was released a couple weeks before this film. I was tossed about whether to see what was summarily declared a flawed film. Ultimately I decided to wait until video.My decision to see this film, despite the warnings about it being a musical, came down to curiosity. Knowing I was willing to see it at least once, I chose to screen it in Imax. Trying not to follow critic reactions to the film, I nevertheless had to admit the musical angle didn\\'t work for me. I don\\'t like musicals. I will chalk it up to a failed experiment. The most poignant aspects of the Joker character in the world of Scorsese were encapsulated in the excellent first Joker movie. Here in the sequel, the aspects of his life in prison are underwhelming, and the real source of energy lay outside the prison walls.As for Harlequin, she also was perhaps a little too normal. No real spark to her. Her character should have been extremely bi-polar, with mood swings that inspire appropriate set pieces. What I mean by \\'appropriate\\' is that filmmakers carefully avoid the pitfalls of getting too goofy and removing us from the gravitas of the story. Instead in Joker 2, their courtship is very dull. Even the musical numbers are restrained, albeit with a bit of bravado.There are some unexpected twists in the third act, but it takes too long to get there. However, it could very well be that time will change the attitudes toward this movie. I think of another Coppola movie, \"One from the Heart\". A very ordinary tale of a failing relationship set to music (but not a musical). It bombed when it opened, but later recognised as great filmmaking. So who am I to say what is at first an affront to audiences expecting a gritty thriller? It may spark its own subgenre and be lauded as great filmmaking.Final thoughts: This sequel is successful in accomplishing the idea of expressing Fleck\\'s fantasies as standard musical numbers, but it fails to put audiences under it\\'s spell. I give a 4 out of 10.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux is a daring sequel that takes the chaotic brilliance of its predecessor and amplifies it with a musical twist. Directed by Todd Phillips, this film once again stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, the tormented soul behind the Joker, and introduces Lady Gaga as Harleen Quinzel, better known as Harley Quinn12.Set primarily in Arkham State Hospital, the film explores the deepening madness and twisted romance between Arthur and Harleen. The narrative is both haunting and mesmerizing, with Phoenix delivering a performance that is as intense and unsettling as ever. Lady Gaga's portrayal of Harley Quinn is a revelation, bringing a raw and electrifying energy to the screen.The musical elements are a bold choice, adding a surreal layer to the already complex psychological landscape. The songs are hauntingly beautiful, with Hildur Guðnadóttir's score perfectly complementing the dark and twisted narrative. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher captures the grim atmosphere of Arkham, making the hospital feel like a character in its own right.While the film's pacing can be uneven at times, the performances and the audacious blend of genres make it a compelling watch. It's a film that challenges the boundaries of the superhero genre, offering a deep dive into the psyche of its characters.Verdict: Joker: Folie à Deux is a bold and unsettling sequel that will leave audiences both disturbed and enthralled. It's a must-watch for fans of the original and anyone interested in a unique cinematic experience.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"This take on the Joker could have only gone one of two ways: build up the Joker on his next steps towards the ultimate super-villain, or fold him up and place him neatly back into his plastic box with the rest of the toys. This is the most basic way of illustrating why this film shouldn't have been made in the first place. Since, it has been made plain by Todd Phillips that he didn't want to make this a franchise, or go beyond this sequel, then the latter boring option of resolving the events of the first film was the only course, and of course, what's the point of that.Even some of the oft praised, somewhat original, parts of the film, the opening animation sequence for example, foreshadow that you're in for a completely contrived (and completely absent from the first film) bit of screenwriting armchair psychology. Was the Joker a distinct personality of Arthur Fleck or just one dark side of him? Was the Joker just the abused loner all along? There is no deeper sigh to be had.In scene after scene, you keep waiting for the unfolding events to click into some kind of rhythm, but you get the sense that every time the writers weren't sure what to do next, they would distract you with a musical number from Lady Gaga. There was no natural flow, it all felt flimsily strung together, and that's all thrown on top of, and largely because of, a set of circumstances in which telling a compelling story was probably nearly impossible in the first place.\",\n",

I enjoy camp movies and I think there could be a lot of artistic merit and show of talent within non traditional cinema storytelling. E.g. Lighthouse, Poor Things.So a Joker and Harley musical sounded like a lot of fun. Especially since they can incorporate a lot of compatible elements like their quirkiness, physical and wit based comedy, their showmanship, their violence, and the overall over the top Gotham aesthetic that can be found in a lot of DC media/comics. And Harley will also be played by a great singer who does a lot of over the top performances. It must at least be somewhat good.Instead it was so boring, and miserable. It was self indulgent bleakness that was pointless in every possible way. It should be impossible to make a Joker and Harley musical this excruciatingly dull. And yet they achieved it. And I watch a lot of miserable movies (I liked A Serbian Film), at least those movies remember that there should still be an element of fun. It's like they wanted the movie to be unwatchable.I do have a lot of other issues with the movie but i expected or at least can deal with those issues.

The first instalment of Joker was a breath of fresh air, particularly considering films portraying the DC comics world have often received mixed reactions, usually predominantly negative. Joker was dark, edgy and humorous. Joker Folie a Deux has none of these qualities. The concept of the film being part musical sounded a weird idea when I first heard about it, but with Lady Gaga on board I thought it could work. Making the basis of the film a courtroom 'drama' was a massive own goal though. The rhythm of the film fell as flat as a pancake. I feel sorry for Joaquin Phoenix who clearly suffered for his art judging by his gaunt appearance. This is another classic example of Hollywood trying to be too clever for its own good. The writers need to understand that 'if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it' Give the fans what they want and they will return time and again. A massive wasted opportunity.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"*Please stop singing* - Joker whispers pleadingly at one point, summarising the audience thoughts. (one of the few times where I actually heard a reaction from my fully packed auditorium)When Joker (2019) was released, it shocked audiences and critics alike, becoming a box office phenomenon, grossing over a billion dollars and earning widespread acclaim. A bold gritty, raw, and subversive experience that heavily borrowed from cinematic masterpieces like Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, while weaving in elements from Fight Club. These influences were evident, but ultimately, no one cared that the film wasn't entirely original because it was still brilliant in execution. Todd Phillips crafted a grim character study of Arthur Fleck, anchored by Joaquin Phoenix's transformative performance. It became a near-instant classic, defining what a modern psychological thriller could be within a comic book framework.Now, five years later, Joker: Folie à Deux tries to recapture that magic - and fails. Spectacularly.Phillips, this time, ventures further into his own vision, no longer leaning on the established classics that shaped the first film. The result? A disjointed, unfocused sequel that tries to be many things but masters none. The film attempts to blend multiple genres, from courtroom drama to psychological thriller to musical, yet never fully commits to any of them. Each element feels like a half-measure, teasing an interesting direction before abandoning it entirely. The end product is a film that has no clear narrative thread or identity.The most baffling creative choice was to mak Folie à Deux a musical. It's not inherently a bad idea - musicals can offer powerful commentary and depth when done well. However, here the songs feel awkwardly shoehorned into scenes, interrupting the already meandering plot. The musical numbers don't blend seamlessly with the story or add emotional weight; instead, they become unnecessary distractions rather than a hoped deeper exploration of the Joker's psyche. There's no clear reason why the Film needed to be a quasi-musical other than to stretch the thin story. Without these showpieces the film would be significantly shorter and its hollowness more obvious.Joaquin Phoenix's return as the Joker, while highly anticipated, is underwhelming. In the first film, his portrayal of Arthur Fleck was raw, disturbing, and compelling - a character study of a man unraveling. In the sequel, however, his character lacks the same depth and nuance. The film rehashes many of the same emotional beats and traumas from the first movie, offering little in terms of new insight. There are even flashbacks and redundant references to the events of the previous film, as if Phillips wasn't sure what direction to take and decided to lean heavily on past glories. Phoenix's delivers a strong performance but it's not as compelling as the first time. It felt kind of dispassionate at times, as though he either grew tired of the role or was given too much freedom in his portrayal. As a result, the Joker, once a tragic figure you couldn't take your eyes off, becomes less tangible and more abstract. The menace and unpredictability that made him such a fascinating character are absent here.Lady Gaga, meanwhile, brings a raw energy to her role as Harley Quinn, but she is underutilized throughout the film. Her character has none of the layers we saw in Margot Robbie's take on Harley Quinn. Gaga's Quinn feels like a shell of a character, a missed opportunity to add a new dynamic to the Joker's story. The chemistry between Phoenix and Gaga is there but never quite takes off, leaving Gaga's talents largely wasted.The pacing of Folie à Deux is its biggest downfall. The first half of the film moves so slowly that it feels as if it's deliberately wasting time, only for the second half to be nothing more than a repetition of the first Joker. Rather than progressing the narrative, the film constantly looks back, rehashing events from the first film through unnecessary exposition and flashbacks. There is no forward momentum, no fresh take on the story, and no meaningful development in the Joker's psychological journey. This backward-looking structure also dilutes any potential the film had in exploring new aspects of Arthur Fleck's mind. The psychological depth that was so integral to the success of the first film feels watered down here, leaving nothing of substance to grasp onto. The final act completely derails whatever semblance of narrative cohesion the film was trying to maintain.The final scenes leave the viewer not with a sense of closure or deeper understanding, but with frustration and confusion. It's a messy, misguided conclusion that fails to tie together the film's already loose threads. Call it provocation without substance. The viewer is left asking, What was the point of all this?Of course visually, the film is striking. Todd Phillips and his team have an eye for powerful imagery. The lighting, cinematography, and overall production design are aesthetically pleasing, with some hauntingly beautiful moments - particularly those involving the Joker, cigarette in hand, smoke swirling in the dim light. But there are only so many times you can watch the Joker, dramatically bathed in backlight, exhale cigarette smoke before even that feels tiresome. While Phillips deserves credit for crafting a beautiful film on the surface, it lacks the emotional and psychological depth required to make those images stick.The first film was a visceral exploration of societal alienation, child abuse and the therefore created mental illness, the sequel is aimless, shallow, and scattered. Instead of offering a deeper look into the mind of the Joker, it feels like Phillips wanted to make a statement - one that rebels against critics, fans, and even comic book lovers. But in doing so, he forgot to make a coherent film. What we're left with is a movie that's all style and no substance, a failed experiment that never finds its footing.Final Verdict: Todd Phillips swung for the fences with Joker: Folie à Deux, but missed. With weak character development, disjointed pacing, and a musical aspect that adds nothing, the film fails to capture the essence of what made the first Joker so memorable. The finale, which could have offered some redemption or clarity, instead devolves into a nonsensical, extravagant mess that leaves the audience bewildered and frustrated. Even the striking visuals can't mask the hollow core beneath, leaving the sequel as a perplexing and underwhelming addition to the Joker's story.Safe to say the biggest disappointment of the year. 3,5/10.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"A showcase of Joaquin's talent no doubt. His performance mixes subtlety and overblown grandeur to great effect. The film continues the originals commentary on mental illness and how badly supported sufferers are. It is of course a fictional tale, but there are plenty of reasons to ponder how close the fiction matches the facts of inadequate social care and mental health funding in real life. The movie is dark, no bundle of laughs that's for sure. The biggest bugbear has to be that I remain unconvinced that musical standards present the best opportunity to tell that particular story! 5/10 for the movie. 10/10 for JP!\",\n",

What was once a gripping, character-driven narrative has now turned into a mindless cash grab, losing the psychological depth that made the original special. The musical numbers feel out of place, as if they're only there to distract from the fact that this sequel lacks direction and purpose. The singing doesn't add to the plot or the character's complexity-it merely pads out an empty script. Instead of expanding on the story, it diminishes the impact of the original, turning a thought-provoking film into an uninspired spectacle. Enjoy at your own risk.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Or \"the Clown with his pants falling down\".This film had the potential to be memorable, but instead, it seems to be deliberately dull. As the movie itself states, \"All we had was the fantasy\" and they gave up on it. So now, \"we aren\\'t going anywhere\"!I didn\\'t particularly like the original (due to my own expectations and interest in the franchise). Who goes to the theater expecting a realistic, somber tale about one of Batman\\'s most iconic villains detached of its more fantastical elements? But even I could see what the original delivered-Powerful imagery of someone becoming a symbol and an emissary of chaos and change. It had depth, it was a good study on the topics and even a message! But it was never about THE Joker. It was a good movie with a franchise label slapped on so it would sell better.. and it never had the intention to deliver on it\\'s promise. It was clear to me then, and now it seems to be obvious to everyone else now! The negative reactions come as no surprise, as they chose not to follow through on the character and what audiences rightfully expected.This sequel is well-shot, well-cast, and executed according to its own vision. The premise was solid, and the foundation could have been interesting.. but doesn\\'t build upon that, the script and interactions are weak, and leaves the audience without gratification. Instead, it closes the book on the story of a man that just wanted normalcy! And personally, I think it was fine.More than anything, I found Lee Quinzel to be one of the few aspects that echoed the promise of the original. She wanted him to keep the chaos alive. But in the end, there\\'s no grand, satisfying plan. Fantasies may be integral to the character, and she understood what music meant to him (as means of manipulation), but ultimately, they don\\'t help the film.. specially when they interrupt what it little it offers constantly.The unnecessary final \"nod\" at Christopher Nolan\\'s departure from WB is hollow, cheap and insulting. Watch it on streaming.. if at all.',\n",

Fast forward a few years and we get this self-indulgent overuse of what worked in sprinkles in part 1.What I mean was that the scenes when the Joker was dancing and flailing were like 5 times too many in part 2. It was basically like beating a cinematic success to death. Lady Gaga and her botoxed glow and duck lips also kind of seemed a bit misplaced. There were times when Gaga and Phoenix had in screen chemistry, but they were so over presented to the audience.One can only hope for a part 3 that redeems itself, but judging on past history of the majority of sequential films, the chances are low of that happening.The cinematography, music (song selections) and lighting was stunning and effective, but the script just seemed disjointed and hollow. The entire film takes place in institutions. We want a Joker that is roaming free amongst society. This story robbed us of that.',\n",

There are frequent musical numbers which supposedly represent Fleck's imagination, but all of them are fairly boring and sound the same.There's no action to speak of and no real plot developments. There's little-to-no references to Batman lore. There's no extravagant set pieces - almost all the movie takes place in a courtroom or in jail.

Lady Gaga also held her own and although I've always been a fan of hers for her unique voice as a singer, she has shown over the years that she is a force to be reckoned with on the big screen.

       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is one of this year\\'s most anticipated films, or maybe just my most anticipated film, yet it\\'s this year\\'s biggest letdown film. The first Joker is very special for me and my page, as this was the first movie I reviewed, and I also enjoyed it. I\\'m a very sentimental person, and when they announced that there would be a sequel, I was excited. Then they confirmed Lady Gaga would play as Harley; I was even more excited. The biggest lesson I learned from this movie, I guess, is to lessen your expectations. From the direction and writing, the whole film felt like it was written by a mediocre kid at school who thinks everything they did is superior---It\\'s that bad, really!The writing and direction felt uninspired and lazy. The film follows Arthur Fleck\\'s life, waiting for his trial for the crimes of Joker. While struggling with his dual identity as Arthur Fleck and Joker, Arthur stumbles upon true love and finds the music that\\'s always inside him. The synopsis may have the potential to be a poignant exploration of mental health, but the film struggles to find its footing. The pacing is almost unbearable, as it gets dragged and dragged with nowhere to go. The film doesn\\'t know what it is trying to convey; the dialogue is flat, and the musical element does not match the narrative.One of the most disjointed elements is the musical component, which seems awkwardly inserted rather than seamlessly integrated into the narrative. The music fails to enhance the story or characters, instead feeling like an afterthought. Although the musical element serves as Joker and Harley\\'s fantasies, it just doesn\\'t work well with the narrative they are trying to deliver. Adding the musical aspect to their dialogues made the film almost feel comical and pretentious. Lee said, \"I\\'m pregnant.\" \"What?!\" Arthur replied, then Lee, out of nowhere, belted out, \"Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near?\" It was hilarious.For a $200 million budget, it\\'s a massive letdown. It is weird to have this much budget, yet no extra or grand was happening. The film\\'s settings were only at the jail and courtroom, so where did the $200 million budget go? Compared to Denis Villeneuve\\'s \"Dune: Part Two,\" which was this year\\'s biggest film, it only has a $190 million budget, but the CGI effects and the quality of the film are far from \"Joker: Folie à Deux.\" Even the first installment has a budget of $65 million, yet it made an astounding $1.07 billion at the global box office.When it comes to the performances, both Joaquin Phoenix and Stefani Germanotta (famously known as Lady Gaga) were electrifying. I appreciate that they are singing live, which added authenticity to their character, and the contrast in their voices sounded so good. However, due to the film\\'s lack of characterization, the addition of Harley \"Lee\" Quinn to this saga is rather unnecessary and underutilized. The addition of Harley Quinn could have been a great character to explore, but as the movie progresses, she fades into the background although her character plays a vital role in Joker\\'s life; it\\'s not that she has less screen time but because there was nothing written for her character aside from being Joker\\'s love interest. Although Joaquin Phoenix was great in this movie, it\\'s apparent that they are capitalizing on his success in the first installment after winning the Oscar for Best Actor and the movie gaining $1 Billion at the box office. Still, sadly, it turned out to be a disorganized and uninspiring film.Everything in this film felt like a mistake. It\\'s a cash-grab movie with nothing promising to offer. The musical aspect could be more cohesive to the whole film. Even the final scene felt like Todd Philips just wanted to end the Joker saga to avoid any further sequels. From start to finish, the film stumbles to find its ground. The entire experience of watching this film felt like witnessing a series of missteps. It comes across as a project primarily motivated by the desire to generate revenue without offering anything genuinely innovative or exciting for the audience. As a sequel, there is an expectation to build upon the strengths of its predecessor, but this movie struggles to find its own identity and purpose. This film is particularly disappointing for fans of the first installment, like myself. The original set a high bar with its depth and complexity, and as someone who appreciated its nuances, I hoped for a sequel that would expand on those strengths. Instead, I left the theater feeling let down by a film that failed to capture the essence of what made the original so impactful.In conclusion, this sequel misses the mark on multiple fronts, failing to capture the depth and innovation that made its predecessor so compelling. Its lack of cohesion and purpose feels like a disservice to fans who anticipated a continuation worthy of the original\\'s legacy. The disjointed musical elements rushed ending, and overall inconsistency contribute to a viewing experience that feels more like a series of missed opportunities than a meaningful story. While the film may achieve commercial success or not, it ultimately falls short of delivering the artistic and narrative fulfillment that audiences were hoping for. As a fan, seeing such potential go unrealized is disheartening, leaving one to wonder what could have been with more thoughtful execution. \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is a testament that not all sequels are necessary.',\n",

Both my wife and me love the first movie, so we were excited to see this.Unfortunately the movie doesn't come close to what made the first movie great. The story just isn't even remotely interesting. It largely rethreads what happened in the first movie, but not even by showing but telling. There's only so many times you can hear characters drone on about how the joker shot someone on live TV. The movie is cut with a frankly ridiculous number of songs woven in that for the most part serve 0 purpose to the story and primarily just break up the pace. It felt like a rather poor attempt st a musical. Both me and my wife were groaning by the 4th song due to boredom, unfortunately they just kept coming. In a mostly empty theater (afternoon showing) there were still 3 seperate groups of people that walked out 45-30 minutes before the end (as what felt like the 10th song started in).Throughout the movie the ending is somewhat foreshadowed as we see Arthur coming to terms with what the joker has done. Phoenix does an amazing job of once again portraying a man struggling with mental issues. We were less impressed with gaga. While great in her own way she didn't feel like a good fit for Harley. The relationship between her an Arthur also felt like the wrong dynamic (which, considering the events of the ending, makes sense). We felt the entire movie should have been the first 45 minutes or so of the actual film (which might roughly be the runtime without all the useless songs) before the story really kicks off.In summary the acting and cinematography were great as it was in the first movie. But a pretty picture cannot save the absolute train wreck of a story and the lack of any character progression or stakes.\",\n",

It's a director's mess who gave into Gaga's pursuit of Harley quin and in turn gave away the movie. Watch it on HBO when it comes on ott as you can atleast skip nearly 1hr of the movie.A case study for NYU to teach how not to self immolate due to some actor's narcissistic epiphany.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"The first film did not need a sequel, but when we heard of a sequel, we had excitement. I have never felt so disappointed watching a film in my life. Apart from some brilliant acting from Joaquin and the guards, and the stunning visuals, this film practically has no other positives. The most disappointing aspect of this film, in my opinion, is the ending. The ideology and symbolism of the ending is perfect, but the execution seems rushed and is awful.The rest of the film feels dragged out and slow, with unneeded musical sequences every five minutes, but the most important thing of the film, was rushed.The lengthy courtroom sequence was the only storyline in the film. There was no character development of Harvey Dent. This could have been Harley's origin story but her 'shared madness' is not shown at all in this film.This film is nothing short of a cashgrab and it despises the first film by trying to completely undo what make Joker so great to begin with.If you genuinely watched the first ten/twenty minutes of this film, left for an hour, and came back in, there'd be no difference, as the storyline was lacking.To be honest, this is a must-see film for fans of the first Joker and DC, as it practically ends the potential world of Arthur Fleck.This film is a love/hate film, and in my opinion I have to watch this again to get my head around what I just witnessed.3.7 out of 10 for me.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"This feels more like a spin-off than a true sequel, spending most of its runtime rehashing the original through court scenes and interviews, rather than pushing the story forward. The writing is serviceable at best, often relying on thin threads to loosely tie one musical dream sequence to the next. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is fine, but it lacks the raw intensity that defined his portrayal in the original. Lady Gaga, on the other hand, seemed to intentionally tone down her usual flamboyance, likely to avoid overshadowing him, which, while understandable, feels like a missed opportunity for a more dynamic performance.The musical numbers, full of energy and spectacle, are easily the highlight of the film, with the singing and dancing offering moments of reprieve from the otherwise sluggish narrative. Unfortunately, these sequences can't sustain the film's momentum. The lack of a substantial plot causes the movie to feel overlong, dragging on for more than two hours, making it feel unnecessarily stretched. Without the gripping psychological tension of its predecessor, the film struggles to find its footing, leaving it more of an indulgent showcase for musical theatrics than a coherent, engaging continuation of the story.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker 2 is a massive disappointment when compared to the brilliance of the first film. The decision to turn what was initially a dark, psychological character study into a musical is baffling and completely undermines the tone that made the original so powerful. The musical numbers feel out of place and detract from the raw, gritty world that was built in Joker 1. What's even worse is that the spotlight shifts almost entirely from the Joker himself to Lady Gaga, making it feel less like a Joker movie and more like a Lady Gaga showcase.In Joker 1, there was a subtle yet significant tie to the larger Batman universe, with references to Bruce Wayne and Gotham City that added depth and context to Arthur Fleck's descent into madness. However, Joker 2 abandons all of that, losing any connection to the broader world that could have made the story more meaningful. The film's narrative becomes so centered on Gaga's character that it might as well have been titled Lady Gaga, not Joker.The only saving grace of this movie is Joaquin Phoenix's incredible performance as the Joker. His portrayal is once again mesmerizing, showing the tortured and chaotic nature of the character. But even Phoenix's brilliance can't save a film that feels disjointed, tonally confused, and lacking the substance that made the first one so iconic.\",\n",

The musical numbers occasionally work, but more often than not, they disrupt the flow, leaving the audience in my theater dreading each one as they appeared. It\\'s a puzzling choice, especially since it felt like the film\\'s target audience wasn\\'t suited for this musical direction.Arthur\\'s relationship with Harley feels underdeveloped, and the progression was predictable, offering little emotional impact. Each scene between them felt like it was building toward something deeper, but ultimately, it just led to \"one more song.\" The chemistry between them, while not terrible, lacked the complexity and tension that could have driven their dynamic further.The tone stayed consistent with the first film heavy-handed and occasionally oppressive. There was less of the classic violence often associated with Joker, which I didn\\'t particularly mind, but the film\\'s messaging still felt forceful and lacked nuance.The third act is where the film finally comes alive, albeit briefly. Here, we start to see some character progression, particularly in how the two worlds have always coexisted. There\\'s a shift that hints at a deeper message about society\\'s celebration of grifting and deception, though it\\'s not fully explored. The fading paint on Arthur\\'s face, symbolizing the gradual dissolution of his facade, was a nice touch one of the few visual details that added depth to the story.In the end, much like the first Joker, Folie à Deux falls short.

       "    'Review': 'Joker: Folie à Deux, directed by Todd Phillips, is a sequel to the critically acclaimed Joker (2019) starring Joaquin Phoenix, but it falls short of the raw intensity and thought-provoking nature of its predecessor. The film was intended to explore the concept of folie à deux-a psychological condition where two individuals share the same delusional belief. However, despite its title, the movie fails to fully engage with this complex psychological theme, leaving the audience with more questions than answers and a sense of missed opportunity.A Misunderstanding of Folie à Deux\\nIn its essence, folie à deux refers to the transmission of delusions from one person to another, often resulting in a shared psychosis. The film hints at this dynamic, particularly in the relationship between Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) and Harley Quinn (Lady Gaga), but it never delves deeply enough into the psychological implications of their shared madness. Harley\\'s transformation into the devoted companion of the Joker, often portrayed in comics and films as a descent into madness alongside Arthur, feels incomplete in this movie.Instead of focusing on how Arthur\\'s twisted worldview infects Harley\\'s psyche, the film opts for multiple musical numbers that distract from the core narrative. These singalongs, while visually interesting, don\\'t add the emotional or psychological depth needed to explore the idea of shared madness. Rather than enhancing the story, these sequences feel like unnecessary distractions, prolonging the runtime and diluting the intensity that made the first Joker film so compelling. In fact, without these musical interludes, the film could have been much tighter, and perhaps, more focused.The Courtroom Focus and Missed Potential\\nA significant portion of Joker: Folie à Deux is spent preparing for courtroom scenes that are meant to build tension around Arthur\\'s fate. Unfortunately, these scenes fall flat, lacking the impact they should have had. The legal drama, which could have provided a powerful setting to explore Joker\\'s manipulation and the spread of his delusions, becomes a drawn-out and somewhat tedious process.Arthur\\'s trial is supposed to be a climax, a moment where the consequences of his influence on society become apparent, but the execution feels underwhelming. The court scenes miss the chance to create a meaningful confrontation or delve into Arthur\\'s manipulative genius. Instead, they serve as more of a backdrop for the film\\'s plot rather than being a pivotal turning point in the narrative.By the time Harley Quinn abandons Arthur, it feels like the central relationship has been underdeveloped. Her departure from him because he refuses to fully embrace the Joker persona doesn\\'t carry the emotional weight it should. It leaves the audience questioning what the point of their relationship was in the first place. Their dynamic is a critical part of the Joker\\'s mythology, and in this film, it feels as though the filmmakers only scratched the surface.A Lack of Direction and Purpose\\nOne of the major problems with Joker: Folie à Deux is its lack of a clear, coherent message or purpose. At the end of the film, it\\'s hard to pinpoint exactly what the director was trying to convey. Unlike the first Joker, which offered a raw, gritty look into Arthur Fleck\\'s descent into madness and his transformation into the Joker, this sequel seems to lack that same clarity of vision.It\\'s true that Arthur, as the Joker, manages to \"transmit\" his delusional beliefs to many of his followers, both outside and inside the courtroom and jail. This mirrors the folie à deux concept on a larger societal scale, as Arthur\\'s twisted perspective seems to resonate with the disenfranchised and downtrodden, sparking a kind of mass hysteria. However, this theme, while present, isn\\'t explored in a way that feels meaningful or new. Instead, it feels like a rehash of what we already saw in the first film, but without the same emotional or intellectual punch.Additionally, many characters-including the Joker himself-seem disappointed that Arthur doesn\\'t fully commit to being the Joker. This sense of dissatisfaction pervades much of the film, both within the story and for the audience. There\\'s an expectation that Arthur will fully embrace his chaotic, anarchic nature, but that moment never quite comes, leaving viewers with a sense of incompleteness. The Joker\\'s ultimate failure to live up to the expectations placed upon him feels anticlimactic.An Alternate Universe and Disappointing Ending\\nThe film also creates the sense that this Joker exists in an alternate universe separate from the Batman mythology that fans are familiar with. This alternate universe approach is somewhat jarring and further removes the film from any of the Batman movies we\\'ve grown to love. The ending especially feels disconnected from any broader narrative, as it offers no real sense of closure or continuity with other DC films. For fans hoping for a deeper connection to the larger Gotham mythos, the film\\'s ending will likely feel frustrating and unsatisfying.Moreover, the final scenes, where the Joker\\'s influence on his followers becomes apparent, don\\'t provide enough payoff for the buildup. The film could have approached the Joker\\'s rise to power in a more engrossing way, focusing on the psychological intricacies of Arthur\\'s relationships and the societal consequences of his actions. Instead, it leaves the audience questioning what exactly they were meant to take away from the experience.Final Thoughts\\nUltimately, Joker: Folie à Deux is a film that had immense potential but failed to live up to it. By focusing too much on style over substance-through the musical numbers and underdeveloped relationships-the movie misses the opportunity to explore its central theme of folie à deux in a meaningful way. The courtroom drama, which should have been a central focus, fizzles out, and the much-anticipated relationship between Joker and Harley Quinn lacks the depth and complexity that their shared madness should have conveyed.While Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance remains strong, the film as a whole feels disjointed and unsure of what it wants to say. The idea of Arthur transmitting his delusions to others, while present, isn\\'t fully realized, and the film\\'s ending leaves viewers wondering what the point of it all was. For fans of the first Joker film, Joker: Folie à Deux may feel like a disappointing and unnecessary addition to a story that was already complete.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'This happens when you never embrace the true direction of your film and yet it turns out to be the case. After all the timidity to identify the sequel to the 2019 box office monster a musical, ladies and gentlemen, Joker: Folie à Deux is a musical. But I am not going to clobber, whack, and thump on this film just for its genre because I like a lot of musical films. And I thought those staged sequences we all saw in the trailers should make sense for our two unsound characters. It did not. Even with the undeniable talent of Lady Gaga, whom will bring us to my next point.I was not stirred by the announcement about the sequel until the addition of Harley Quinn. I love these two characters so much, especially as a duo. All toxicities and abuses aside, Joker and Harley Quinn\\'s power was no joke. Casting Lady Gaga did not turn me off. I know how great she is as an actress and a total performer. The craziness of her artistry should add up. Only to learn her character was a stripped version of the inspiration and more akin to Punchline, Harley\\'s replacement as Joker\\'s henchwoman. Lee was underutilized in Joker: Folie à Deux, a victim of poor, shallow writing of her character, nothing but a bait to comic and Harley fans. Props, however, to her dedication for this character that Gaga even produced a full-length companion album (\"The Joker\" currently on repeat). But I\\'m sorry; her chance to an Oscar nom is now improbable.Phoenix was just as scary good as his Oscar-winning performance in the first film. Gleeson was also a standout as one of the Arkham guards. Guðnadóttir\\'s score was kind of subdued this time, but just equally haunting as her work five years ago. It\\'s Lawrence Sher\\'s cinematography I enjoyed in this sequel the most.Joker: Folie à Deux shouldn\\'t have happened. Too much for Todd Phillips\\' experimentalism and boldness only to under-deliver and land tone-deaf. This is hardly my Jarley. I hope that last scene ultimately draws the curtains on this franchise.',\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': \"We get what we don't deserve\",\n",
       "    'Review': 'Co-written and directed by Todd Phillips, the movie centers around Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a failed comedian who is now incarcerated at Arkham State Hospital and waiting for a trial after committing a murder. There, he meets Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga), and they develop their relationship as the Joker and Harley Quinn.Warner Bros. Probably thought they were cooking something when they greenlit a sequel for 2019\\'s Joker, but instead, they give us more examples of why not every movie deserves a sequel, especially when the first one is obviously enough. I still remember at the time of its release, the ending had already sparked a conversation and many theories among the audience, and that\\'s it, there was no need to go much further than that.Well, the joke\\'s on me for being pumped about this unnecessary follow-up. It\\'s evident that Phillips wasn\\'t planning to make a second movie in the first place because Folie à Deux contradicts everything that happened in the previous one, the idea for a sequel is probably born out of demand from the studio, nothing else. That\\'s why whatever the message they are trying to say isn\\'t working, it made Arthur (Joker) like a completely two different person in this one. Arthur had so many things against him to fully embrace the Joker persona at the end, and the build-up to that moment is perfect, but here, he suddenly forgetting about things that \"made\" him before and, in the end, says he isn\\'t what people are saying because of uhh, moral conflict? (i don\\'t know, lmao).Lady Gaga did best with what was given to her even though all of her excellent performances were in the musical segments because she was doing what she\\'s good at....singing. The same goes for Phoenix; he isn\\'t as impressive as he was before. Their relationship is a real letdown with almost no development, they are only having fun when they\\'re signing. Some of the musical bits are good I even enjoyed it but the transition of the scene always throws me off and they\\'re making intense moments into nothing.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'I felt positively about the first \"Joker\" film, though not perhaps as positively as many others did, so perhaps it\\'s quite fitting that I feel negatively about \"Joker: Folie a Deux\" though not as negatively as many others seem too.Whilst awaiting a competency hearing ahead of his trial for several counts of murder, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) meets Lee (Lady Gaga) another patient at Arkham, though one on minimum security. Fleck is allowed to participate in the musical therapy class where he talks to Lee, who explains that she loved \\'The Joker\\' since seeing him in a TV movie about his actions and the pair begin a love affair. Fleck is torn between supporters who want to see \"The Joker\", and his lawyer Maryanne (Catherine Keener) trying to make a case for him avoiding the death penalty, for reasons of insanity.Not unlike the first film, \"Folie a Deux\" again engages in numerous fantasies and dream sequences allowing you to question which sections are actually happening and which are \"made up\". Because of that it\\'s open to endless interpretation and analysis. Personally, I don\\'t particularly buy the \"we must punish the people with whom the first film resonated, because they are the \\'wrong people\\'\" suggestion. If, for no other reason, than it\\'s produced by Warner Brothers who have already shown their willingness to take a completed movie and turn it into a vaulted tax write off. That argument gives the producers too much credit.I did feel like the musical numbers were disappointing. I\\'m not sure why, given the time, and money, to turn their fantasy dance numbers into almost anything - they\\'re all so low key. Lady Gaga particularly keeps things restrained, perhaps as if she (or the production) was concerned about blowing Phoenix away too much. It feels like a small film too, essentially restrained to only three or four real sets. The courtroom scenes never feel like they really get going and there\\'s no twist or reveals that stem from that.I haven\\'t revisited the first \"Joker\" film, since seeing it at the cinema and I can\\'t imagine that I\\'ll be back to this one again, but I never felt it was \"walking out\" bad - just dull.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Regardless of your thoughts on Joker (2019), one thing that can be agreed on is that it did not need a sequel. But, unfortunately for everyone, money talks and its clear WB wanted a sequel. And so here we are, with an unnecessary sequel to a decent first movie which ended fairly well. What we have now is a film desperate to right the perceived wrongs of the first, a bloated, meandering sequel that ultimately has nothing to say.To start with the positives, and there are a few, the acting in this film is great. I was surprised that Joaquin Phoenix still gave it his all, when he could have easily phoned it in. Lady Gaga was also excellent as Lee Quinn (that's her name) and the pair have solid chemistry on-screen. The film is also well-shot, maintaining the aesthetic of the original film and the score is pretty solid, although it reuses a lot of the first film's score. An aspect that I wasn't expecting to like was in fact the musical numbers. Some are actually quite solid and I can see the potential in making this a musical. It does play well into the Joker's psyche. It is then a real shame that the execution is all over the place with very few of the numbers truly contributing to the overall film and most are clearly there to distract from the pacing, plot and writing.This film is pretty slow, and not a lot happens. At times it feels incredibly repetitive, with a lot of scenes feeling redundant and so often a musical number is sprinkled into a conversation just to make it appear interesting. The film lacks a strong POV, constantly switching between Arthur and Lee, when I personally think having Lee be the POV would have made the film stronger. The character work is also questionable, especially when it comes to Arthur. It seems Todd Phillips disliked how many people enjoyed Arthur's descent into madness and thus decided to regress him back, presenting The Joker as merely a persona, even though the first film ends with him fully giving in. By the end, I am not even sure what the point is anymore. I can see the idea, but it is poorly executed with little attention given to it. What frustrates me most is that this film is ripe with potential, but it squanders nearly all of it which leaves this film feeling half assed and empty in the writing department.Overall, this film just doesn't need to exist. It reduces any significance the first one had, whilst adding nothing new itself. It is constantly on the cusp of something potentially great, but it never commits. It is a shame, because there is great potential here, and everyone (barring the writers) seem to be giving it their all. A film that will leave you with a blank expression once its all said and done.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"My review of Joker is that it felt a bit short and didn't cover an extensive range of material. The pacing was slow, and the film was mostly confined to just two main settings: the prison and the courtroom. However, what I appreciated about the movie was the insight it gave into the Joker's mind. It was fascinating to see how his past experiences shaped him into the person he became.While Joker felt limited in scope with its slow pace and confined settings, it excelled in exploring the psychology of the character. The deep dive into the Joker's troubled mind and the events that shaped him was captivating. We got a glimpse of his transformation, from his traumatic past to the circumstances that led to his current state. The movie didn't rely on action or numerous locations to make its impact; instead, it focused on the psychological unraveling of the Joker, which made for a thought-provoking experience. The minimalistic approach in storytelling allowed the audience to fully absorb the complexity of his character.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"The best way to describe Joker: Folie à Deux is that it's an uneven road, occasionally lined with cherry blossoms, but ultimately leading to nowhere.What's frustrating is that everything is there: unparalleled performances, a multidimensional soundscape, state-of-the-art set design, vibrant and well-realised musical numbers, iconic scenes and imagery, a masterclass in cinematography and lighting - But all of it amounts to nothing as the director's ego overpowers the script's ego.An argument can be made that the film does too much, while another segment of viewers might rightfully claim that the film doesn't do enough to justify its existence.The makers try to tell a story that simply isn't there. The characters at the start are unchanged by the end (if you can call that an end). There's an illusion of journey when in reality it never began.Half of this film is a song sequence. Now, I don't mind musicals, and the symbolism of music is well justified within the film. But by the time the 15th song rolls, it feels like the magician has no more tricks up his sleeve. Symbolism comes at the cost of effective storytelling.With a reported $200 million budget, Joker 2 feels miniscule compared to its predecessor, which outclasses it in nearly every aspect. It has its moments, but the negatives outweigh the positives for me. A narrative mess, a cinematic blunder, and a disservice to the character.\",\n",

And YES, unfortunately 5 stars is a justified rating. Not terribly bad, but nonetheless a failed sequel.The bad: let's forget about the songs for a moment, let's us only focus first on the spoken acting scenes. Are those any good? All the acting is done really well, BUT that doesnt make it an interesting, captivating or thrilling sequel, ON THE CONTRARY, the spoken acting scenes are incredibly BORING. Why? Because it's basically nothing more but a boring court room movie. NOTHING BUT BORING COURTROOM TALK. Who is gonna wanna watch that?!More bad: NOW let's focus on the songs. The songs aint bad by itself either. Joaquin Phoenix CAN really sing and he has got a dark rough edge to his voice which gives the songs a nice dark twist, BUT unfortunately the songs dont add anything to the core of the movie and the songs are not that good that they stand out as a musical. So it's NEITHER a great musical (at all), NOR is it a thrilling movie, (if yoiu would only judge it by the spoken acting scenes).It's a FLOP. I LOVED the original Joker movie and I am great fan of Joaquin Phoenix, but this sequel (howewer well acted and sung) is a complete NOTHINGBURGER. Totally void of any real thrill or true drama.

       "   {'Review Summary': 'An underwhelming continuation of the brilliant original',\n",
       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is the sequel to the 2019 superhero/supervillain film \"Joker\". Once again directed and co-written by Todd Phillips (\"Road Trip\", \"Old School\", the \"Hangover\" trilogy) and starring Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, it is an underwhelming continuation of the brilliant original that doesn\\'t end up delivering what it promises.Sometime after the events of the first film, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is incarcerated at Arkham State Hospital awaiting trial for the murders and misdemeanors he caused years earlier. During his stay, Arthur struggles to deal with his duel identity as \"Joker\", unable to distinguish between his own actions and those of the destructive persona he created. As the media prepares to extensively cover the upcoming legal proceedings, Arthur meets Harleen \"Lee\" Quinzel (Lady Gaga), a new patient at the Hospital who admires him as the Joker and as his own damaged self. Amidst the ensuing chaos of media scrutiny and public outcry, Arthur and Lee\\'s infatuation with each other begins to grow, culminating in their mutual appreciation for the music inside of them.I am always hesitant to refer to a movie as a \"modern masterpiece\", however, I firmly believe that 2019\\'s \"Joker\" is well worthy of such an honour. This movie works not only as a fantastic contemporary origin story of one of the most famous comic book villains of all time but also as a social commentary on the human condition and the stigma of mental illnesses. As a result, the film managed to transcend the boundaries of your typical \"superhero\" movie, allowing audiences from all walks of life to take note of everything important it was trying to say. Although the film was clearly intended as a standalone feature, Warner Bros. Later decided to continue the story in the sequel \"Joker: Folie à Deux\", a decision that does not work in their favour as it fails to recapture nearly everything that made its excellent predecessor so impactful.In the years since his arrest, we see that Arthur Fleck has now built up quite a notorious reputation throughout his new home at Arkham Asylum. His fellow inmates fear and respect him for the anarchy he was responsible for years ago, and the guards frequently taunt him into telling them a \"funny joke\" to cause his Joker personality to emerge. Yet in spite of all this acknowledgement he once deeply craved, Arthur remains relatively quiet and mostly keeps to himself. Occasionally, Arthur\\'s signature pained laughing outbursts stemming from his condition may occur from time to time, but he does nothing about it until it eventually subsides. Later, we learn that Arthur is set to stand trial for his crimes, to which his law team try to argue that his actions were actually caused by his Joker persona, meaning he can enter an insanity plea and escape the death penalty. Though all of this seems like a solid way to begin a sequel to the original, what follows is where the film starts to fall apart from the seams.During a therapy session, Arthur comes into contact with Lee, a seemingly troubled woman who claims to have burned down her parents\\' apartment building. The two form a connection with one another and come up with a plan to \"ditch this joint\" and go on the run. The way the film chooses to present this to us is through song, with the pair of them singing and dancing to pre-existing music. Normally, I wouldn\\'t have minded this unorthodox addition to the film if it were handled properly, which unfortunately it isn\\'t. The problem here is that none of the songs are all that memorable and don\\'t really leave a lasting impression, and for a film that sets itself up as a musical, that is a major issue. Because of that, I never really felt as though these two were kindred spirits proclaiming their love for one another as much as a pair of weirdos singing along to music that only they can hear.Another issue is that the film\\'s screenplay lacks proper cohesion. In the original movie, every pivotal event that took place always flowed flawlessly from one scene to the next, with each character-focused moment communicating all of the necessary information back to the audience. Here, on the other hand, the plot feels so fragmented and inconsistent that it\\'s difficult to fixate your attention on a particular scene without concern as to whether it will matter later on. For instance, in this one scene involving Arthur professing his love for Lee, he is shown doing so during a televised interview, which you\\'d assume would lead to something important immediately after. However, this is not the case, as it quickly ends and its relevance to the plot is never brought up again. There are several other moments like this which constantly tease the audience that something huge about to happen, only for it to disappear into thin air a short time later. After a while, this makes the film incredibly frustrating to watch.To give credit where it is due, I really appreciate that the film was able to recreate the original\\'s superb cinematography and visual style. I absolutely loved the dreary, gritty imagery that director Todd Phillips used in the first film, which gave it a very distinct look to help this 1980s version of Gotham City stand out from all of the others. Thankfully, this sequel follows suit in that regard, as there were moments that I thought were visually stunning. Without giving away spoilers, there was this one part that involved Arthur and Lee looking into each other\\'s eyes with fire burning in the background. The blocking of this scene illuminates Arthur while Lee is mostly shown in the dark, symbolising the bright but destructive way she lights up his life. This proves that there was at least some creative thought put into this film from a visual standpoint, so it surprises me that virtually everything else falls flat in comparison.Reprising one of the greatest roles of his career, Joaquin Phoenix does everything he can to remind us of why his performance in the original film is now ranked alongside Heath Ledger as among the best live action depictions of the Joker. However, in the grand scheme of things, it just simply isn\\'t enough to save this film from the rest of its problems. Because of all the glaring faults in the film\\'s screenplay, direction, and plot inconsistencies, it\\'s near impossible to feel much empathy for Arthur this time around. His character does not do much aside from repeatedly yearn for Lee through song or make weak excuses for his criminal behaviour in the previous film. I missed all that anticipation and unpredictability of what Arthur would do next, as this was one of the key things that made him so interesting last time. Sadly, I never once felt any of that from this movie.Perhaps the biggest disappointment, for me at least, was the utilisation of Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn (a.k.a. Lee). In the lead up to the film\\'s release, I was actually looking forward to seeing how Gaga would portray the Joker\\'s female sidekick/love interest, as I thought she was a great choice to play this emotionally damaged character. Unfortunately, there\\'s hardly anything memorable worth mentioning about her involvement in the story other than her thinking what Arthur did in the first movie was \"bold\" and \"brave\". This could have been the perfect time to provide a commentary on toxic relationships and why many imprisoned murderers have loyal female fans, but the film squanders all these moments away at every given opportunity. What we get instead is a rather two-dimensional story of a mentally ill man and a mentally ill woman who have no other reason to want to be together other than that they are both unstable people. To add insult to injury, Lee is hardly even in the film enough to leave a lasting impression, and considering she\\'s supposed to be one of the main characters, this seems like a very bizarre creative decision.For a follow-up to one of the greatest films of the 2010s, the only thing that \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" has done is prove that just because you can make a sequel, doesn\\'t always mean that you should. After five years, I can still remember picking my jaw up from the floor in amazement after watching the first film, whereas with this one I was struggling to recall anything in great detail without the need to look it up online. Nobody is going to be playfully reenacting dance numbers from this movie and nobody is going to be quoting from it anytime soon like they did with its predecessor. In my humble opinion, Warner Bros. Should have left the original as a standalone film, as I think everything concluded perfectly then and there. It makes me think that this unnecessary sequel may just be one big joke at our expense. If it is, then I don\\'t get it.I rate it 5/10.',\n",

Especially when talking about mental health disorders. The portrayal of the disorder could have gone deeper. The failings of the system were grazed over. The ball was dropped in several scenes. However, the acting was phenomenal. Both Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga did their best with what they were given. Unfortunately, the storyline just didn't hold up. The musical additions made sense but went on for far too long. It felt like fluff and didn't really add anything to the film.

       "    'Review': \"I went into this curious and open to it apparently being a musical, but I feel kind of conned. I guess the joke's on me. As a musical, it falls really flat, and there's only so much heavy lifting Lady Gaga's voice can do. It made me wish I was rewatching Chicago instead, and Dancer in the Dark is a better crime/courtroom musical too.Joker: Folie a Deux feels provocative in an empty way, whereas the divisive original movie felt like it had a bit more to say and said it in a way that was often clear and engaging. This sequel is all over the shop, but not in a fun or varied way.The pacing is quite shoddy, and the interestingly grungy world of the first movie doesn't get explored much here, owing to so much of the film being set in a maximum security psychiatric facility or a courtroom. The fantasy sequences wear out their welcome after a very short while. There's little rhyme or reason as to when they appear and why.Joaquin Phoenix is good, but the performance feels lacking compared to the first seeing as the material lets him down. Lady Gaga does her best, but she's given far less to work with here than expected. No one gives an abysmal performance by any means, but no one has what they need to excel. The writing here feels lazy, and it hurts the actors.I'm a little more positive on how it looks. Some of this visually gives the film a pulse here and there. And though the songs aren't implemented well, the score here is excellent, courtesy of Hildur Guðnadóttir once again.I wanted to come away admiring the film going for broke and indulging in a genre lots of people seem to resist or outright reject. I feel that's what most people are going to latch onto and dislike by default with this film. I like musicals, though. I just don't really like this musical. Intriguing in theory but disappointing in execution.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Combining movie genres can be tricky business. When the mix is right, the outcome can be truly impressive, but, when it\\'s off, it can spell cinematic disaster. In the case of this long-awaited sequel to the 2019 box office and critically acclaimed success, unfortunately, the result is closer to the latter than the former. Picking up where the protagonist\\'s story left off, this saga about charismatic villain Arthur Fleck (a.k.a., the Joker) (Joaquin Phoenix) finds him in prison awaiting trial for his string of heinous crimes. Most of the picture\\'s first half takes place here, an unlikely venue for Arthur meeting the love of his life, the psychopathic Lee Quinzel (a.k.a., Harley Quinn) (Lady Gaga), who diligently stands by her man when he eventually goes to court, the primary focus of the film\\'s second half. So, at this point, the picture is already part prison film, part courtroom drama and part dark romance. But, if that weren\\'t enough, writer-director Todd Phillips draws upon a fourth genre - musicals - to make the mix even more overstuffed (but, hey, if you\\'ve got a talent like Lady Gaga at your disposal, why not, right?). The result is a convoluted, overlong, often-uninteresting offering that\\'s heavy on style but weak on substance and not especially interesting. Admittedly, the performances of the two leads and many of the supporting players (Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener and Steve Coogan in particular) are quite good, doing a more than commendable job of making this material look far better than it actually is. In addition, stylistically speaking, the picture is terrific when it comes to its production design, costuming and cinematography. And the soundtrack is great, too, including an array of superbly chosen standards to complement the narrative (even if there are a few too many selections). But these strengths by themselves aren\\'t enough to make a good picture overall; what\\'s stuck in between these elements feels more like filler than substance, and that\\'s where the movie falls apart. In my view, \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" isn\\'t as resoundingly awful as many reviewers have made it out to be in light of its artistic and aesthetic accomplishments, but that doesn\\'t mean this release is not without its share of problems, most notably in the dreadful writing and mishandled film editing. This is one of those pictures where you get to the end and are likely to heave a heavy \"Ho hum, so what?\" And that\\'s regrettable, given that the character and this picture\\'s predecessor both deserved better than what this follow-up has to offer. If you haven\\'t seen this yet, you might be better off sticking to the picture\\'s genuinely stellar trailer, as that\\'s ultimately much better than most of what\\'s found in this clunky 2:18:00 release.',\n",

The idea of Joker as a character has so much potential, and I was exited for all the interesting ways in which the story could have gone, but this simply didn\\'t. Yes, it\\'s musical, and while the musical numbers added little to nothing, yet I had absolutely no problem with them. The acting?

That realization burrows in slow, and by the end, you\\'re just sitting there thinking, \"That\\'s it? Really?\" It just seemed to go nowhere, especially where the character of Arthur/Joker was concerned. It is gorgeously shot and looks amazing; the movie, from a cinematic point of view, is stunning. The ambiance and atmosphere hit all the right notes. But with all that said and done, it doesn\\'t do anything.You just keep waiting for the story to take flight or do something major, and instead, it introduces Harley Quinn then. Nothing. It really feels like it\\'s digging itself into a hole instead of going anywhere meaningful. I think they should have taken the story in a whole other direction or did more with it.So for now, this feels like the end of this Elseworlds story, and truthfully, that is probably for the best.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'What you\\'ve heard is true. Joker: Folie à Deux is not good. But my reasons for not liking it, I think, are different from why most people don\\'t like it. Let me be clear, I don\\'t fault this movie for trying something new. I don\\'t fault it for taking big risks. I don\\'t fault it for directly challenging what made the first film so iconic. What frustrates me is how half-baked and half-assed everything is. For a film with such daring ideas, Todd Phillips clearly doesn\\'t have the courage of his convictions to follow through with any of them. The passion that should drive this film is missing entirely. Lazy is the best word to describe it.Arthur Fleck is in Arkham Asylum, awaiting trial. He\\'s beaten and run ragged by a thuggish gang of prison guards. One day, he meets Harley Quinn during a session of \"musical therapy\" and Harley falls madly in love with him. As it turns out, she\\'s attracted to the dangerous celebrity he\\'s become. Think of the psychotic love notes that real-life serial killers get in prison, and you have what this film is sort of touching upon. Since they both love to sing, they sing... and they sing... and they never stop singing. Yes, it\\'s a musical. A big jukebox musical, complete with choreographed dance numbers.I reiterate, I\\'m not against the concept of making this a musical. But it\\'s how they go about it here that\\'s so disingenuous and cynical. If Arthur and Harley sang only to themselves, with no orchestra backing them up, it would\\'ve been akin to the behavior of real-life psychopaths. Think of the Charles Manson prison interviews from the 1980s. But instead, it\\'s nothing more than an excuse to hear Lady Gaga belt out a few show tunes for the soundtrack.Lady Gaga is a fine actress, and an even finer singer, but Todd Phillips creates a version of Harley Quinn that gives her absolutely nothing to work with. She does not match Arthur\\'s mental illness in any way. She isn\\'t convincing as a person who would realistically be locked away in an asylum. You genuinely feel how cheaply she\\'s used to sell tickets here.We\\'re slogging along with this film for the greater part of two hours. But then, there\\'s the last 20 minutes. This, in my view, is where the greatest concepts and risks of the film are realized. The first Joker movie thrived as a spectacle that held a mirror to a decimated American society, obsessed with lone-wolf killers and their pathetic, selfish reasons for committing their atrocious crimes. This film wants to take that and smash it into a thousand pieces. Todd Phillips may be telling us that he never wanted Joker to be such a controversial film in the first place. I get the sense that not only is he unhappy to have made a sequel, but he\\'s pissed at how most of us interpreted it. Maybe it\\'s because I had lost so much patience by the film\\'s end, but I found the shocking conclusion to be cathartic and rewarding. As a microcosm of how we should view these horrible people as a society, it\\'s even more satisfying.I realize that everyone\\'s take on this film will be vastly different. That\\'s a great thing. Even bad films should get people talking. It\\'s a shame that that bad film is a sequel to Joker.',\n",

       "    'Review': '5.3/10 (Don\\'t Recommend)Oftentimes when I see a review, or reviews, of movies before I go see them and they\\'re on the negative side. I try and push them aside. I hope I\\'ll see something the reviewer didn\\'t see and have a better outcome. Unfortunately, that is not the case for \"Folie á Deux\".My concluding thoughts on the film were, \"man what a waste.\" The first \"Joker\" film is amazing. It\\'s fun, exciting, and you have someone to root for. This movie is utterly boring and useless. It\\'s not funny. It\\'s depressing and not memorable. It lacks actual character, and I feel like it gives me no one to root for.While some could argue that the soundtrack is good, I personally think it\\'s a distraction. Every time a musical number comes up, just as I was beginning to enjoy a sequence, I felt like the winds in the sail were blown out because it takes away from the pacing of the film. I personally think the musical numbers should\\'ve been worked in with something happening on screen pertinent to the movie.I\\'m indifferent to Joaquin Phoenix in this one. He definitely sold the depressing aspect of the film, but scenes where there should\\'ve been energy, he definitely lacked. Lady Gaga feels like she\\'s just trying to salvage her career. I don\\'t know if she\\'s still producing music, but there was a lacklustre performance from her. She\\'s also the only reason I believe this film was a musical. If she\\'s not in it then I think it would\\'ve been a normal film.Overall, it\\'s a long two hours of nothingness. The ending is atrocious and the beginning is forgettable. The middle is dredged by an ebb and flow of enjoyable film interspersed with terribly paced musicals. Also, it was difficult to understand the spoken word at times in general. Mix that with a musical and sometimes I was hoping I didn\\'t miss anything important. If I knew then what I now, I would\\'ve definitely waited for the film to hit a digital stream. For me it\\'s not even worth going on a cheap night, nor if someone was willing to pay for my ticket to go just to keep them company. But I can\\'t keep you from going so the choice is always yours....That\\'s it for now. Thanks for taking time to read my review. Happy watching and enjoy the show!',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux hardly tries to be cohesive in its Story, but then ironically interferes the story with long Musical sequences without giving them context or combining them into the plot.Funny how The Joker has nothing to do with the films story, it is about the actions of the Joker that happened prior. Joker is a passive character and we learn nothing new about him, the development he has is that he realizes he doesn't want to be the Joker anymore, which does not a single bit represent the character we've seen in the last film. It rather represents a commentary about the critics and audiences that looked at Joker from a morally questionable standpoint. And of course, Joker can't do what Joker does anymore because that would hurt the Image of the Filmmaker. Or should I say the Studio?The point is that this film plays it safe. Joker doesn't blow up things, he doesn't play games, he isn't on the verge of becoming Gothams biggest threat, he isn't the Joker. He's just Arthur. And I am watching this film to experience the embracement of The Joker that Arthur develops throughout the story, which unfortunately doesn't happen...Joaquin Phoenix does his best but it isn't enough to make this Character fully fleshed out. Even Lady Gaga, which has no depth to her character, doesn't serve the story a single bit. There is nothing they discover about each other, there is no room for development in these two. They have no chemistry together because Harley being in Arthur's Life doesn't change anything about his character. The same goes for her.The courtroom scenes have their moments, but all these moments do is referencing the first movie.I can understand that these musical scenes should give us a glimpse of Joker's mind, but there is nothing f-d up about these sequences beside a few things. The mind of the Joker is way more disturbing than dancing and singing happily.And yes, The Filmmaking and the score is great in every single scene, but it does not help when the picture releases no emotions inside of you.Yes, it is logical for Arthur to defend himself in court. Yes it's a more realistic take on the relationship of Harley and Joker. But depth is not existing. Realism without Depth and meaning means nothing.That said, I would rather have an illogical story that is thematically strong, than an story that makes sense but is thematically shallow.\",\n",

       "    'Review': '\"Joker:Folie a Deux\" is a sequel that they never really thought of making. Only after the vast popularity of \"Joker\" have they given it a thought of making a sequel. The thing is this movie doesn\\'t really connect. Its biggest issue is that at its core it doesn\\'t really know the story it wants to tell. Joaquin Phoenix returns as the titular character but there are moments here where he feels less grant than the original movie. Lady Gaga is criminally underused. Although they almost filmed it like a musical, Lady Gaga sings less than Phoenix. It also plays as romance,and sometimes as a court room drama. The truth is the movie is a little bit of all of those genres and that\\'s not bad. What is bad though is how they never really understood how to navigate all these genres to make a coherent story. The movie ends and you feel numb but you really have to try a lot to see how everything that happened falls in place in the story. The themes do come together at the end, but it should have been a more coherent storytelling. \"Joker:Folie a Deux\" is a long underwhelming sequel. It goes to show that Phillips\\' Joker was only good for what he already showed us before.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"So I'll start like most reviews I've seen for this film by starting with that i loved the first one. That was a superb slow burner of a film that built up to an amazing climax and was full of memorable scenes and quotes.Trying to pull it off twice was a tall order but I didn't quite expect it to go this way.The film is set two years after the first one with Arthur Fleck locked up and awaiting his trial and, while in there, meets Lee Quinn in a musical therapy group.The first flaw, for me, was that this really isn't much of a storyline to sustain a film well over two hours, it's just too long! It really does drag in parts.Secondly Todd Phillips can dress it up all he likes but this is definitely a musical. Now admittedly it isn't as bad as I thought. It's not like they're singing every two minutes and at first some of the musical scenes actually work but after a while they started to grate on me.The performances from everyone are superb except for Steve Coogan who makes a completely unnecessary appearance as Alan Partridge with an American accent.There's another brilliant film in here somewhere but it just gets too bogged down in its own self indulgence. The wacky opening scene was annoying and just added, like lots of other uneeded bits, to an already too long run time.I get where they were going with this at times, and it was almost clever, but it didn't quite come together for me but nice try anyway.I did get a kick out of characters, from the original, turning up in court to discuss how Arthur's behaviour affected them and I liked the use of a couple of locations from the first film.Sadly it just fails to build on the first film. There's no stand out moments, like Joker dancing down the steps outside his apartment or the wonderful dialogue on The Murray Franklin Show, you almost feel like it's going to happen and then it falls flat.Despite all that in a year full of let down sequels this, at least, wasn't completely terrible. I will definitely give it another watch to see how it works without my expectations up. But for now I shall sit on the fence and say that despite the fact it wasn't brilliant it also wasn't quite as bad as feared by early negative reviews so it's middle diddle for Joker Folie a Deux with a 5/10.\",\n",

Also the repeatabily of the scenes in jail is just boring and it adds-up to the already exosting songs . To add up this movie is not about the Joker . Arthur becomes Joker only for a couple of scenes and the switch between Arthur\\'s two characters is too steep . To be honest though the \"secret\" meanings of the movie are good and delivered superbly . For me the only people that should see this movie are the ones that havent seen the first one although I would suggest watching the first one instead .

       "    'Review': 'So, before watching this movie, I rewatched Joker (2019) and I loved it. It is one of my favuote DC movies ever. Possibly my 3rd fav. But it felt like a standalone to me. So I didn\\'t seem to care too much about potential sequals. But when I first saw the trailer scene of Joker dancing with Lady Gaga, I thought it looked awesome. Even though it was confirmed to be a muwsical, I was pretty open minded. The first 40 mins of this film is actually pretty good, and I was confuseed as to why people hated the film. Some musical scenes were decent. But as we got into the 2nd and 3rd act, I started to understand the HATE. It is so slow, messy and boring. The biggest joe of the film (no oun intended) is that it is so boring. HOW DO YOU MAKE A BORING FILM WITH TWO OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHARACTERS IN ALL OF DC? The middle act went on and on and I was BORED. The final act did capture my attention, but it all felt meaningless. While I do understand what Todd Phillips was trying to do with the ending, it falls flat on it\\'s face when the movie seems so unfocused. I didn\\'t care for the ending as I didn\\'t even enjoy the majority of the movie. Very underwhelming and a bit dissapointing. I don\\'t recommend wasting your time watching this. But if you are curious, then please, go check it out. Overall, I will rate it 5/10. It is a \"MEH\" Movie.',\n",

Riding the tidal wave from the first film. Show me a VILLAIN. Instead the whole film was confused, frustrating, boring and weak.

However, Lady Gaga\\'s character doesn\\'t allow her to fully explore her range, which feels like a missed opportunity given her talent.

       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is a film that finds itself in the middle and balances between being good or bad, in other words it is \"decent\" or \"so-so\". By adding the musical genre, the script is strange to the concept presented in the first film, and does not have that avant-garde element that director Todd Phillips hoped to capture. The script touches on interesting elements about a social idol, who creates a cult and who, by presenting himself as he really is, divides opinions among his fans, apart from this, the script fails to go further. The cinematography is good being the strong point of the film. The musical numbers manage to be of mixed quality, there are good ones and bad ones. The production level is high, making it the most notable positive point of this sequel. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance declines compared to the first film and Lady Gaga achieves a good role that loses intensity in the plot. Todd Phillips\\' work as director is very average on this occasion. \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is a film with ups and downs that works in some scenes.',\n",

In any case, the music is great as are the others in supporting roles. Nothing was left of Gotham or the story of Batman, and in comparison to the first film about the Joker, everything that held the story together was missing. The film is worth watching for the excellent costumes, mask, camera and close-ups of the two main actors that keep you awake until this hour too long film is over.

At times it looked like the story could go in the direction of exploring Joker/Arthurs psyche, to then suddenly turn the focus onto Gaga's character or another unfitting song. Other times the story would look like it was going towards Joker and Harley having the comic book relationship many would've liked to see (done better than suicide squad) on the big screen, to again ripping it out from under the audience. From the outside it seemed like the writers just wanted to write a surreal, whimsical musical, and forgot to have an actual fulfilling story.All in all, the movie had loads of beautiful cinematogrophy done by Lawrence Sher, the usual impressive acting by phoenix, and a surprisingly good performance by Lady Gaga.

       "    'Review': \"After the masterpiece that the first Joker film was, I waited for the sequel to be even more amazing-especially with the intriguing subtitle, Folie à Deux, hinting at a deep dive into the shared madness between two characters. Unfortunately, what I got instead was a film that left me feeling profoundly underwhelmed.Yes, the acting is undeniably strong. Joaquin Phoenix continues to deliver his methodical, unsettling portrayal of Arthur Fleck, and Lady Gaga shows real potential as Harley Quinn. Both actors gave it their all, but the material they were working with left much to be desired. The script gave them little room to explore the complexity of their characters. In contrast to the first Joker-a dark psychological thriller that masterfully peeled back the layers of Fleck's mind-the sequel felt hollow, relying more on style than substance.The decision to make Joker: Folie à Deux a musical was certainly not the best choice. In theory, I can understand wanting to inject something new into the sequel to avoid being a carbon copy of the original, but the genre shift felt really out of place considering how Joker was lauded for its haunting, psychological approach to topics like mental illness and societal breakdown.Lady Gaga, was clearly cast to showcase her acting chops, not just her vocal skills. So why lean so heavily into the singing? It felt as though the filmmakers were more interested in creating an extravagant showcase for her musical abilities than allowing her to fully inhabit the darker, twisted persona of Harley Quinn. Her acting moments showed promise, but the movie never gave her the space to explore her character in a way that felt authentic or emotionally resonant.In the end, Joker: Folie à Deux feels like a missed opportunity. It lacks the raw, nerve-wracking intensity of its predecessor and tries to compensate with flashy musical numbers and surreal set-pieces. But beneath that glittery surface, there's not much to hold on to. The psychological depth that made the original Joker such a profound and unsettling experience is largely absent here, replaced by spectacle.\",\n",

Having known all of this prior, I truly can't understand what people we're expecting? I set my bar for the movie extremely low. I'm not a comics or superhero movie fan, which is why the first Joker felt like a breath of fresh air. If I have to see another A list actor on steroids in tights I'm gonna gouge my eyes out. Go watch one of the billion superhero movies that follow cliche cookie cutter formulas, rehashing the same stories over and over ad nauseum if you don't like these interpretations? Like I said, I didn't have high expectations from the get go, I hate virtually all musicals I've ever seen. This seemed like an experiment. I respect director's taking risks, even if the final vision falls somewhat short. Keeps art alive. That being said, I think Joker: Folie à Deux slightly surpassed my (already very low) expectations as A MOVIE. The reality is that I will watch any movie JP is starring in, even if the movie seems bad. I watch Joaquin for what he brings to each performance, more than I generally care about the director or their movies. Joaquin brings a vulnerability, honesty, raw/realness to every performance and always impresses me with how he interprets roles. Was the movie amazing? Definitely not. Was it decently entertaining for a sequel that is a musical? Absolutely.I will admit that I kind of zoned out during most of the singing parts.... but the acting in between was great and the story was decent imo.\",\n",

However, in its defence I found it wasn't quite as dreadful as anticipated.First, let's talk positives: the cinematography effectively captured the grimness of Arkham Asylum. I found the slow-burning storyline intriguing. Although not much happens, the visual storytelling kept me engaged-at least until we hit the courtroom scenes.Now for the downsides. The film is peppered with random musical numbers that feel entirely out of place. It seems this turned into a vanity project for Lady Gaga, with Joaquin Phoenix's involvement coming off as delusional and egotistical. Some scenes were outright cringeworthy, with Phoenix looking visibly embarrassed while dancing in the dreary asylum. A few dream sequence musical numbers might have been tolerable, but this was overkill.The film's portrayal of the Joker's infatuation with Lee is another misstep. He comes across as old, tired, beaten, and weird. Lee doesn't appear crazy enough to be obsessed with him. Additionally, the courtroom scenes drag on unnecessarily. The oscillation between Joker's ego, Arthur Fleck's beaten demeanor, and the genius-crazy Joker is hard to believe.In summary, *Joker 2* is a disappointing sequel that attempts to be clever and unique but ends up being ridiculous and muddled.\",\n",

This was very similar to fan complaints of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) being too much like Star Wars: A New Hope (1977). So, for the second installment in that series, Rian Johnson made some bold and divisive choices. The difference between the choices made by Johnson then, and Todd Phillips now, is that the choices Johnson made had legs. Whether you liked The Last Jedi (2017) or not you can admit that the movie had bold ideas, but these ideas were also interesting. The same can not be said for Joker Folie a Deux.Making a super villain movie a musical is indeed a bold move, however, nothing was done to make it an interesting move/movie. For it to be a strong idea, the musical elements of the film have to land or at least be memorable. Cycling through the Best of the 50s and 60s isn't a bold musical choice. If you're going to go full musical, which this is, put some time into making original songs.Remove all the music from Folie a Deux and what do you have? A two hour slog split between Arkham Asylum and the courtoom. The few moments where Joaquin Phoenix is allowed to cook (doing a Foghorn Leghorn voice in court) are some of the few bright spots in the film. Otherwise, this was an ambitious undertaking that isn't even interesting enough to be polarizing.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'There is actually a good movie in there somewhere but Why did they have to cut away 15 times to stupid ensembles that contributed nothing to the movie, it was nothing but an unwelcome distraction. Was there not enough time to write the script so they had to fill it with songs?Parts of the movie were enjoyable with some sort of resemblance to what made the first movie so popular. However everytime I began to enjoy it another song popped up and by the end of the movie it actually began to feel like torture. It gets a 5 out of 10 for the small bits of the movie we did get to see. Hopefully a version gets released without the cutaway to annoying singing scenes, even if it will only be about 45mins long.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"I feel conflicted about Joker: Folie à Deux. As someone who loved the first Joker, I went into the sequel with some concerns, especially after hearing mixed reviews. Now that I've seen it, I'm still processing how I feel.I'll start with the musical aspect. I'm not a fan of musicals, and while this movie didn't change my opinion, it didn't bother me as much as I expected. The musical numbers felt integrated into the story, but they didn't elevate the experience for me either. And there weren't as many musical moments as I feared.Visually, Folie à Deux is just as stunning as the first movie. Todd Phillips once again proves he knows how to create beautiful, immersive sets and craft visually memorable scenes. The film's aesthetic is one of its strongest elements.Joaquin Phoenix remains fantastic as Arthur Fleck. His performance continues to be a highlight, and even though I didn't love certain aspects of the story, he fully embodies the character once again. However, one thing that bothered me throughout the movie was that Arthur's character arc didn't feel like it moved forward. Instead, the film seemed more focused on giving us a retrospective look at Arthur, almost trying to reverse or undermine the progress of his journey from the first movie. Maybe trying to hard to antagonize certain aspects of the audience who really liked the first one.Then there's Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn. While she's undoubtedly talented and adds to the plot, her character felt underutilized and a bit forgettable. She has the voice for the musical moments, but Harley herself isn't fully fleshed out, which left me wanting more from her portrayal.The film's ending also left me a bit infuriated. I personally think the movie would have been better if it had ended about 10 minutes earlier. The ending we got really made the first two hours seem rather pointless.Overall, Folie à Deux isn't as bad as some people say, but the first movie is miles ahead of this one. It is thought-provoking, and either way, whether you thought it was good or bad, you will be passionate about your feelings about it. But the sequel didn't capture the same magic, and by the end, I think it would have been better if Joker hadn't gotten a second movie at all.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'The original Joker has been categorized as a \"psychological thriller\" and this movie has been categorized as a \"musical psychological thriller.\" The theater listing categorizes the movie singularly as \"suspense.\" Let\\'s be clear. There is no mystery, suspense, or thriller here. And aside from brief acts of violence, there is no action. I agree with critics that call this a \"quasi-musical courtroom drama.\"Avoiding pre-release marketing, as I do, I had no idea I was in store for a musical. The movie \"boasts\" 15 musical numbers, oddly, only 4 less than West Side Story (1961). That said, the singing was intentionally fashioned to be \"unprofessional.\" So there\\'s that. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s singing voice sounds like Randy Newman on a bad day.To be fair, Phoenix delivers a tour-de-force performance as he did in the original. However, the feature length movie built out from it is a vapid house of cards with no true \"plot\" to speak of.The courtroom footage was dry and befuddling at best. And to say that Zazie Beetz \"reprises\" her role from the original movie is disingenuous as it\\'s no more than about 5 minutes of testimony.Phoenix is imprisoned for the ENTIRETY of the movie, and, inexplicably, Lady Gaga is seemingly allowed to come and go as she pleases.Most of the musical numbers are sung \"in fantasy\" and some seemingly (but not conclusively) \"out of fantasy.\"Frankly, then, the movie is not a satisfying musical or courtroom drama or thriller. It\\'s more akin to a clumsy campy misguided version of La La Land.',\n",

You take a character like Joker and you put him one of the most boring settings, a courtroom, and that's where most of the major scenes take place! Where's the unpredictability? Where is Fleck interacting with the world that he created? Sowing the seeds of chaos that he planted in the first movie? DC continues to prove that they have no clue what to do with this character. And it's disappointing to say the least. You're better off watching Batman the Animated Series reruns and the Dark Knight at least that Joker is menacing and a credible threat.

While the original film provided a deep and unsettling look into the psyche of Arthur Fleck and his transformation into the iconic villain, this installment seems to lack that same focus. Instead of building on the character's mental unraveling, the movie distracts itself\\nwith songs that don't seem to fit the narrative or enhance the story in any meaningful way. The plot feels disjointed and fails to capture the raw emotion and tension that made the first Joker film so compelling.The majority of the scenes come across as incoherent, lacking a clear direction or purpose. For much of the runtime, it's difficult to understand what the movie is trying to achieve, and the pacing feels uneven. The only moment that truly stands out is the final second of the film, which delivers a payoff that might resonate with hardcore fans of the DC Universe. However, for those who are not well-versed in the intricacies of the DC lore, even this moment may leave viewers feeling confused or unsatisfied.In summary, Joker 2024 doesn't capture the same depth or tension as its predecessor. Its reliance on unrelated musical choices and a plot that only makes sense to those deeply familiar with DC's background diminishes what could have been a powerful continuation of the Joker's story.\",\n",

Manipulation to his best by the director.Great performances as expected and it's a very believable story in the Joker world that's what matters, don't go away from what he his. Ofc this isn't any build up to a crazy Batman universe so you need to see this as a musical and with some understanding of who is the Joker, if you can't see the movie thinking you're in his feet's but you're just there to consume wathever is in front of you then it's not worth.For the fans of the Joker I think it's a great movie, for people that don't have any idea of who he his or just want some crazy action like its usual in super heroes movies, don't waste time.\",\n",

The shifts in tone were confusing, and one could even argue that they indirectly ruined the film. Phoenix's Oscar-worthy performance remains as extraordinary as ever, while Gaga, compared to her roles in A Star Is Born and House of Gucci, came across as a bit lackluster. But it's not her fault-the issue lies in how her character was written. Her singing ability is beyond doubt, her performance seemingly effortless, and her voice very moving, but in the musical scenes, Phoenix clearly couldn't match her.As a Batman fan, I couldn't feel any chemistry between Joker and Harley. Instead of Harley being the leading lady, it felt more like she was just a tool to drive the plot forward-and that plot was incredibly disappointing, especially if you loved the first film. The first movie showcased how a person from the bottom of society, bullied, oppressed, ridiculed, and tormented by various illnesses and childhood traumas, was slowly pushed into darkness and eventually descended into madness. In the second film, however, the focus was more on his confusion about himself and his uncertainty in facing the public's expectations. Sure, you managed to overthrow the city and start a revolution, but the crowd only idolized the symbol you represented. Once you take off the mask, no one cares about the real you. While the movie's message was still profound, the execution fell flat.The first movie, in my mind, was flawless, a 10/10 masterpiece. But this second one? I can only give it a 5/10. It was that bad and that disappointing, and I sincerely wish they had never made a sequel.That being said, I'm really glad I spent last weekend on a long road trip, looping Lady Gaga's latest album Harlequin at least ten times. It gave me some sense of connection to the musical elements in this film.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'I don\\'t like musicals, never have. I don\\'t like the music and I don\\'t like that everything\\'s always so incredibly over the top happy, I don\\'t like that apparently everyone always knows all the songs and the dance moves and they just drop everything to ... sing and dance, almost as if their lives depended on it (this might make a fun horror movie). So when I heard that the sequel to \"Joker\" would be a musical, I was very disappointed. In the end I still watched it because I really enjoyed the first movie and a sequel, even a musical sequel, couldn\\'t be that bad, right?I\\'ve read complaints about the movie not using original songs. My reply to those: Originals songs wouldn\\'t have worked. The songs in \"Folie à Deux\" actually have a point - I still didn\\'t like them (not a genre of music I enjoy) but they actually fit the overall tone - without spoiling anything, this really is the Joker we know from the first movie but he\\'s singing - and they never felt disruptive, which sets the movie apart from the few other musicals I\\'ve seen (glimpses of). There\\'s even a scene that I enjoyed (Joker and the courtroom #1).The image in IMAX was great (volume warning for the sentence!), Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga do a good job and while the sequel is sadly a lot tamer than the first one, it\\'s still not even close to PG-13. So why the bad rating (I guess you could see 5 stars as a neutral rating)?Do you remember the TV shows from the late 2000s and early 2010s? 20+ episodes per season, 20-40 minutes each. Eventually they couldn\\'t come up with a new story, so they did a filler episode. Sometimes this was a flashback episode, sometimes it was a musical, sometimes it just had the characters running around in circles. \"Folie à Deux\" is the latter. The movie is almost 140 minutes long but there\\'s basically no progress to the overall \"Joker\" story. Don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s not boring (for me at least, others who expect a \"true\" sequel might feel a different way) but, apart from introducing Harleen and Harvey Dent, and a tiny origin story, there\\'s no point to it. It\\'s a movie that feels as if it wants to set up another sequel but it barely even does that.The ending of \"Joker\" felt satisfying, the ending of \"Folie à Deux\" just left me asking: \"What now? This can\\'t be it, right? Where\\'s the rest?\"',\n",

       "    'Review': 'I wish I could erase this movie from my brain so that I can enjoy the first movie without knowing the disappointing way the story concludes.The first joker film showed us Arthur\\'s journey from a victim of society, downtrodden and unloved, to his own hero who finally passes his breaking point and learns to stand up for his own beliefs. He finally has confidence, love and self respect and all of his restraints have snapped.Folie a Deux seems to undo all of that character development and turns him back into victim who will never be able to break free. A theme of the movie is whether the Joker is real or whether he is just a fantasy or figment and the moral of the story appears to be that Arthur will always be just Arthur and nothing more.The songs add very little to the plot and some seem misplaced as if they\\'ve been forced in to the story despite holding almost no relevance.The plot is incredibly basic and moves nothing forward. Arthur attends court hearings while dating Lee. It seems as though it purposefully makes no sense like it\\'s a nod to Arthur\\'s joke \"I hope my death makes more cents that my life.\" At one point Gaga\\'s character, Lee, tells Arthur to stop taking his meds as though there is something planned for him or his rescue but it\\'s never mentioned again and is only relevant to show that Lee only really loves him when he\\'s the Joker rather than himself.They add strange social commentaries for example Gary from his work in the first movie testifying that Arthur has caused him the same fear that Arthur once felt, as if trying to blatantly point out that evil begets evil, but it just comes across as a bit bizarre and irrelevant.They also add more information about his mother mocking him to others which seems out of character for how his mother was played in the first movie as though they only added it to make something, anything, happen within the plot.Phoenix and Gaga do a fabulous job and are the high point of the movie but they\\'re really not given much of a script to work with. The relationship between the characters isn\\'t really explored and there is no Folie a Deux present. Gaga\\'s character fangirls over Joker and they begin a romance. The relationship doesn\\'t go any further, they don\\'t become any kind of chaos causing team-up, they just date a bit while Arthur attends court like she\\'s a groupie which is a disappointment. The relationship between them could have been fascinating if the appropriate time had been spent on it rather than their main on screen time together being during dance sequences.All in all the movie falls flat. Worth a watch once but once is enough.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Saw Joker 2 today.Someone behind me as I was leaving the cinema summed it perfectly - 'It's not as impactful as the first.'The first Joker was a gritty, uncompromising, nasty, tension filled and utterly unique look at a man's mental illness. Joker 2 undoubtedly shares those same qualities but to a far lesser degree, failing to reach the lofty heights of it's predecessor.Joker 2 though isn't bad - it just feels as if it's lost it's way. I totally clicked with the intentions, themes and messages of the first movie whereas in Joker 2 I can't honestly say I felt the same way. I was left confused by what the film was trying to say to me.What Joker 2 does do is greatly expand on the character of Arthur Fleck, yet strangely not in a way that felt satisfying. I kept wanting to know more or connect emotionally but the reality is I couldn't. I understood but I just didn't care. Joker built the character of Arthur Fleck up whilst Folie A Deux knocks the character right back down.The stand out of Joker 2 are the performances. Phoenix is pitch perfect again as Fleck (if sightly less menacing) whist Gaga is not a bad choice as Harley but here is where one of my biggest points against the film stands - I didn't like their relationship. I felt it didn't really build or develop as naturally as it should and it definitely didn't go the way I expected it to. Although it's clearly not a film set in the typical Batman world, Folie A Deux felt like an outright betrayal of the lore of the world.Maybe I went into Joker: Folie A Deux with too many expectations. But a film can disappoint your expectations and still be an excellent film - but Joker: Folie A Deux isn't an excellent film. IGo in expecting something unlike anything you've ever seen before and you may be pleased. Go on expecting a decent sequel to Joker and you'll be disappointed. I unfortunately have to not recommend it.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'When you decide to make a sequel to what is arguably the best \"become villain\" film ever made, you\\'re probably very confident in what you\\'re doing. How confident Todd Phillips and the team were-I\\'ll try to break down in my fresh pre-premiere impressions with a bit more analysis. When the film was first announced as a musical, it instantly received a lot of backlash. You might have already noticed the hate has grown even more after the pre-release screenings. While some think it\\'s because of the musical aspect, I wouldn\\'t fully agree. My friend Tarik, who joined me in the packed IMAX theater, did protest by wincing at the start of each singing scene.The musical here operates largely on an abstract level, and as such, it\\'s visually very pleasing and aurally effective in the context of Joker and Harley\\'s \"madness for two.\" However, since most of the musical segments don\\'t really affect the plot, they feel unnecessary. The few songs integrated into the real-time narrative didn\\'t convince me of their purpose, leaving the overall musical component as passable but far from what a good film in that genre should be.Before diving into the plot elements without spoiling anything, I must address the film\\'s title, which is there purely as \"bait\" to get you into the theater and spend money on the film. \"Folie à Deux\" refers only to the abstract part of the film, so if you were expecting wild and murderous adventures of Harley and Joker, forget about it. As the trailers suggested, the plot takes place in a prison, two years after the chaotic events in Gotham when we watched Arthur Fleck\\'s transformation into Joker. Now, Joker is facing trial for what he\\'s done, making the majority of the film a courtroom drama. But we\\'ve all seen good courtroom dramas, and \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" functions quite well in that regard. The drama is tense, filled with great dialogue and, I must say, humor. The film carries a wonderfully subtle humor-at least that\\'s how I interpreted many scenes, though I can\\'t say for certain whether that was the director\\'s intent.Like the first part, this film boasts visually stunning shots, phenomenal acting from Joaquin Phoenix, decent performance from Lady Gaga, and top-tier set design. Harley Quinn, portrayed well by Gaga, has little impact on the plot, which didn\\'t sit well with me. On the other hand, Joker\\'s psychological development is notable, something I found impressive at first, but it eventually ruined the film for me. Despite its flaws, this was a good movie right up until the end. However, in the final third, the writers take a narrative turn that reduces Joker to just another average socially distorted character, rather than the symbol of nihilism, madness, and chaos that he has always been. This is a shallow, misguided, and, to use a colloquial term, idiotic choice by the writers, further exacerbated by the film\\'s conclusion. It\\'s unlikely to sit well with even the most hardcore fans, and I really wanted to like this film.In conclusion, \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is not only an inconsistent sequel but also a completely thoughtless approach to the core idea this story should represent, leaving a bitter taste for all fans.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Rating is 6/10Watched on Sept. 30 2024 @ Fan First Premiere (First Watch)Format: (Digital) IMAXTodd Phillips repeats exactly what he did to The Hangover trilogy with Joker 2. The director goes on to make a sequel that is unfortunately empty and has no character development.Phillips outdone himself in directing a film that has an outstanding cinematography/visuals that portrays every feeling and emotion that it wants to tell and express. BUT, he failed in creating an engaging storyline. From a part one to a part two, usually the characters of the film change. Their arc either declines or inclines. Their personalities change. Events/obstacles come along their way to shift their lives. OR new character/s enter their life which opens the door for more interesting events to come along their way resulting in a \"Folie à Deux\". In this film, Joker\\'s/Arthur Fleck\\'s life doesn\\'t seem to change much as Gaga\\'s character, Lee, is added. Instead, the film keeps repeating its events by REvisiting the past (the first Joker film) or reacting some of its scenes. It also keeps coming back and forth to the same locations and events within this film itself. Resulting in an overall dull film that is ONLY visually entertaining.This film introduces two major characters within the Gotham world, Harvey Dent, who is played terribly by Harry Lawtey and written even worse. By the end of the film, I felt like he was useless and is taken advantage of because of his \\'name\\' within the comic books fandom. Same goes to Lady Gaga\\'s Lee that simply felt like it wasn\\'t even in this film.I enjoyed how this film uses music/songs to showcase that it\\'s an ESCAPE for our inner selves. But, the song choices weren\\'t on point. On the other hand, their performance was well done by Gaga or Joaquin Phoenix and Lawrence Sher\\'s cinematography skills.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker 2 attempts to once again dive into the mind of Arthur Fleck, but unfortunately, it treads too much of the same ground as the first film. The original Joker was such a meticulous and thorough character study that by the end, it felt like there was little left to uncover. That exact feeling haunts this sequel, as it struggles to find new dimensions to Arthur's complex psyche, leaving the film feeling more like an epilogue rather than a fresh narrative.Joaquin Phoenix, as expected, delivers an excellent performance as Arthur Fleck, further cementing his unsettling portrayal of the Joker. Lady Gaga also brings depth to her role as Harley Quinn, adding a new dynamic to Arthur's story. However, the movie continuously pulls away from their strong performances with unnecessary musical numbers and courtroom drama that feel out of place.Ironically, the movie feels its best when it alludes to the iconic scenes and atmosphere of the first film, rather than when it tries to experiment with new elements. The callbacks to Arthur's lonely and disturbed journey in the original film evoke the same eerie tension and emotional weight that made Joker so powerful. However, the attempts to add new layers with the courtroom drama and out-of-nowhere musical sequences ultimately detract from the story's flow, feeling more like distractions than meaningful additions.The film shines brightest when it focuses on the twisted and toxic relationship between Joker and Harley. The chemistry between Phoenix and Gaga adds a fascinating layer to the film, but unfortunately, these moments are too few and far between.Ultimately, Joker 2 feels more like a continuation that didn't have much more to say. While it has its highlights, particularly in its performances, the film feels like an unnecessary add-on to the first rather than a compelling new chapter. For fans of the original, it might feel redundant, offering little new exploration of Arthur's character or the world he inhabits.\",\n",

My actual rating would probably be around 4 or 5, but I\\'m giving it a 6 because I know this film is going to get a lot of negative votes, and it does have some merit.First off, it felt more like a musical promoting Lady Gaga\\'s \"new album\" than the dark psychological thriller I was expecting. Don\\'t get me wrong, Gaga is talented, and her performance was solid, but the excessive musical numbers really disrupted the mood. This isn\\'t the kind of film where I want to be pulled into a Broadway show mid-story.

The pacing dragged, and it lacked the intense energy that kept the original Joker engaging from start to finish.On the positive side, the cinematography was beautiful, and Joaquin Phoenix is still excellent as Arthur Fleck. The acting was there, no doubt about that. But even with these strong elements, something was off. The film felt overly long, and by the end, it just seemed to lose direction.In the end, Joker: Folie à Deux had its moments, but the musical direction and uneven pacing left me feeling underwhelmed.',\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': \"Folie d'un Seul\",\n",
       "    'Review': 'In 2019, Todd Phillips\\' \\'Joker\\' took the world by storm. A moody origin story for the infamous Batman villain- as well as a powerful examination of mental illness- the film grossed over a billion dollars at the box office, and is still the second highest grossing R-rated film of all time. Superbly acted and beautifully shot, the drama- inspired by the films of Martin Scorsese, most evidently \\'The King of Comedy\\' and \\'Taxi Driver\\'- received near unanimous praise, from viewers and critics alike.However, it was not without some critical controversy. Some writers, like Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair, suggested the film was overly sympathetic \"towards white men who commit heinous crimes.\" Others, such as Jim Geraghty of National Review, felt that it would encourage \"America\\'s angry, paranoid, emotionally unstable young men\" to commit crimes like the ones depicted in Phillip\\'s narrative.Despite this, most concede that the film acted as a poignant, cautionary tale; showing how a societal disregard for the vulnerable can create someone as dangerous as Arthur Fleck, aka: Joker. In this way, it was an important film, that actually had something to say (which the majority of Phillip\\'s previous directorial features largely hadn\\'t). This made it something of a rarity in the landscape of comic-book adaptations- as did the fact that Phillips never intended to follow it up with a sequel.A rarity and a gamble, for studios want a sure thing. Indeed, it must have been incredibly difficult to get Warner Brothers to pony up the dough for a dark, stand-alone comic book adaptation in the age of the Marvel movie; where certainty is measured by quips, meta-humour and familiarity. That Phillips got \\'Joker\\' made- combined with its whirlwind success- seemed to be a harbinger of sorts; heralding that smaller stories could be just as affecting and as successful as the juggernaut Marvel franchise; proving that not everything actually needs a sequel.However, in Hollywood need is dictated by profitability; and if anything makes over one billion at the box office, a sequel will surely follow whether viewers, or the filmmakers, necessarily feels one is really warranted.Hence \\'Joker: Folie à Deux,\\' which, if the original was a gamble, is like a game of Russian Roulette with half the chambers loaded: a very risky business indeed. Whereas the first \\'Joker\\' was a dark psychodrama following Arthur Fleck on his descent into madness, \\'Folie à Deux\\' is a musical, detailing Fleck\\'s struggles with his dual identity in the run up to his trial for murder, alongside his number one fan, fellow inmate and love interest Harleen \\'Lee\\' Quinzel.Off the bat, credit must be given to Phillips for taking such a risk and going in a new direction, genre-wise. He and fellow screenwriter Scott Silver could have easily rested on their laurels, simply remaking the first film all over again, knowing it was a blueprint for success (as has been happening with the Marvel movies since- what now feels like- the dawn of time). That they decided to make a musical of all things takes genuine guts and, while perhaps foolhardy, must be applauded. It\\'s a massive swing, that not many directors would take.A massive swing that doesn\\'t exactly result in a hit. The first film had an engaging, tightly plotted narrative, with a compelling central character whose story arc felt organic and real. The sequel feels scattershot in comparison, as if Phillips and Silver weren\\'t sure what to do with Fleck and Quinzel, nor in which direction their story should head. The musical numbers within- and the runtime seems to be at least 50% song and dance- are routinely strong and emotionally resonant, though often feel like padding.Phillips has stated that Fleck sings when he can\\'t find \"the words to say what he wants to say,\" though, to a cynical viewer, it seems that Fleck sings because Phillips and Silver realized their narrative was too slim to justify a runtime of two hours and eighteen minutes. Indeed, much of proceedings are centred on characters recounting events from the first film, or consist of direct flashbacks.In addition, the idea- hastily introduced at a late stage- that Fleck may not be comfortable being turned into an icon at the expense of his own personality is shoehorned into the cigarette-paper-thin veneer of a plot. This feels at odds with his established character as a whole and, especially, the ending of the first film. Furthermore, the trial sequence- bar an extended scene featuring Gary Puddles, the diminutive clown from the original- is surprisingly dull and forgettable.Having said that, the doomed central relationship between Fleck and Lee is a genuinely affecting one. There have been on screen relationships between arguably insane characters before- Mickey and Mallory in \\'Natural Born Killers\\' and Lula and Sailor in \\'Wild At Heart\\' come to mind- but rarely are they as grounded and as tender as Fleck and Lee\\'s. Had the narrative around them been stronger, or if he and Silver had been more assured with regard to the film\\'s message; Phillips would have had a great work on his hands.Unfortunately, as it is, \\'Folie à Deux\\' lacks enough substance to make its own mark, outside the shadow of its predecessor. This is not to say, however, that it doesn\\'t have anything going for it. As mentioned above, the musical numbers are heartbreakingly performed and expertly choreographed. A sequence involving a Sonny & Cher-style variety-show is a stand out, as well as a devastating moment when Fleck recites \\'Ne me Quitte pas\\' into a courthouse phone.Additionally, Mark Friedberg\\'s production design atmospherically creates a seedy, cold Gotham City, where hope is a rare commodity; and love even rarer. Moreover, Lawrence Sher\\'s striking cinematography recalls the first film, though his use of stylizations and colour makes \\'Folie à Deux\\' a distinct beast; more like the films of Gene Kelly than Martin Scorsese (that Sher has mentioned Francis Ford Coppola\\'s ill-fated musical \\'One from the Heart\\' as inspiration is unsurprising, though also bitterly ironic).Furthermore, the performances are all incredible. Joaquin Phoenix once again powerfully portrays the complexities of a damaged mind, and is electrifying. Intense, nuanced and sadly believable, he carries the film squarely on his shoulders. Lady Gaga does similarly fine work opposite him as Lee, credibly bringing to life a borderline psychotic with aplomb. The madness in her eyes is disconcerting, and she has rarely been better on film. She and Phoenix work well together, performing the various musical numbers masterfully, whether together or apart.In addition, Brendan Gleeson does typically sterling work as the sadistic prison guard Jackie Sullivan; elevating what many other actors would have played as a straight villain into one of the film\\'s more interesting characters. Catherine Keener impresses greatly as the film\\'s only real \\'good\\' character, Fleck\\'s lawyer Maryanne Stewart, while Harry Lawtey brings the smug DA Harvey Dent to life well; even if the character is as generic as cardboard.Moreover, Leigh Gill\\'s excellent, impassioned performance as Gary Puddles in the film\\'s best scene lingers long after the credits have rolled, while Zazie Beetz\\'s strong work as Fleck\\'s original love interest Sophie is similarly impressive. Both deserved more screen time. Contrastly, although Steve Coogan has made his bread-and-butter playing smarmy characters, from Alan Partridge to Tony Wilson, his stereotypical American accent as journalist Paddy Meyers is jarring; though he\\'s still effective.In conclusion, Todd Phillip\\'s \\'Joker: Folie à Deux\\' could potentially have been a great film, were it not for its weak narrative and familiar plotting. Where 2019\\'s \\'Joker\\' ran, it crawls, often straying into the drab territory of the underwhelming. Despite lush cinematography and terrific performances, it comes as a bitter let-down. Although the songs are admittedly well-performed, they fundamentally feel like filler in a film that doesn\\'t know what it wants to be. It is neither as clever nor as controversial as its predecessor and- in comparison, sadly- decidedly disappointing. In the end, although it took guts, why Phillips made the film as a musical is not a folie à deux, rather a folie d\\'un seul- which makes the joke on the audience.',\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': \"Phillips; A Director Who Doesn't Care For The Devoted Audience\",\n",
       "    'Review': \"Todd Phillips is a masterclass director, directing some of the highest grossing films of all times like The Hangover. Joker (2019) was no exception to this, being the highest grossing restricted movie of all time at time of release. I was lucky enough to snag two tickets to a premiere in my area for Joker: Folie a Deux, and I left the theatre more disappointed than I anticipated. All of the ingredients were there to make a good recipe, and somehow, this movie came out of the oven tasteful but insanely dry.The film follows Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) after the events of Joker (2019). He now has a devoted fanbase outside of his imprisonment at Arkham Asylum, and has even made friends with fellow guards and prisoners. Upon being upgraded to a minimum watch zone within the penitentiary, he meets Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga), a superfan who has devoted her life to following Arthur's mentality. Together, they devise a plan to get them both out of jail where they can eventually live a happy life together, but at the cost of putting the Gotham in danger.Heres what the movie does right: the direction and cinematography. Being a direction nerd, I was so taken aback by the beauty of some of the shots in this film. Please see this on the biggest screen you can. I saw it in an IMAX theatre and it was so beautiful to behold. Phillips knows exactly what he's doing with these shots and what they are adding to the story. Also, the performances. Gaga, as always, never fails to surprise me with her acting abilities. Phoenix, reprising his oscar-winning role, hasn't lost sight of the character at all, and once again wowed me, a similar, slightly less scared, feeling as when i left the theatre to Joker (2019). The production and scenic design were also great as always, but we knew that going in. Especially knowing that this is indeed a musical, they really went for it.Heres what I perhaps didn't like as much: 2 main factors. The musicality, and the script. I love a good musical; some of my favourite movies are musicals. In this movie, the music felt so forced and not needed. I got exactly what they were trying to do with the numbers, and some worked (If my friends could see me now, Oh when the saints). But a lot of them just felt like filler in a rather empty movie. Which brings it into the next major point, the script. This movie has no clue what it wants to be. Its mostly a courtroom drama that has an outcome anyone could see coming, and also jumps the shark with less than 10 minutes left in the runtime. Phillips doesn't trust the audience to have either seen the first one, nor follow any DC lore. Lee Quinzel, obviously an anagram for another very famous DC villain, feels completely underwritten in this movie. We have zero clue who she is and when we see her character for the final time, you still don't really have a clue who she is. Harvey Kent plays a pretty main role in this film, and anyone knowing batman knows exactly who Harvey Kent is, who he becomes, and what his intentions are. It wasn't shocking. Nothing surprised me with this movie, which is so sad because the first one left my spine tingling. That was the most unfortunate part once the credits started to roll.Overall, this movie is indeed watchable, but after coming off of such a high from the first movie, it leaves a sour taste in your mouth. It's not bad by any means, in fact, I enjoyed it more than I didn't. But I really dont think this movie got to the apex it needed to, but it got 70% there. I predict it will get big but not the levels of Joker (2019)\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"This movie had the potential to be a great follow-up to its predecessor, but unfortunately, it falls short in several areas. While Joaquin Phoenix once again delivers an outstanding performance, elevating every scene he's in, the rest of the film doesn't live up to the same standard. His portrayal of Arthur Fleck remains deeply compelling, and if it weren't for his commitment to the role, the film would have been much harder to sit through.The story, however, felt disjointed and left far too many questions unanswered. It seemed as though much of the narrative either stalled or was confined to the courtroom, creating a repetitive structure that lacked forward momentum. We barely learned anything new about the characters or their motivations, particularly Lee. There was so much potential to explore her backstory, but instead, her character felt one-dimensional, like she was just upset over a bad breakup, which felt underwhelming and incomplete.Lady Gaga's performance lacked the depth and emotional intensity that the role demanded, making her character feel flat and uninspiring. Given the complex, chaotic nature of the Joker's world, this lack of dynamism felt like a major missed opportunity.Overall, this movie could have been great. With Joaquin Phoenix's talent and the rich potential of the Joker character, there was a real chance to dive deep into compelling, gritty storytelling. Instead, the movie opted for a repetitive plot and underdeveloped characters, making it fall short of its potential.\",\n",

I love the experience of watching a creation like this on a Dolby big screen but I was so confused the whole time as when will stuff start blowing up and the action begin?This movie does not really satisfy the expectations that was built from the first one. It is not crazy, it's not madness, it's just odd drama. Half the scenes are a creation of Arthur Fleck's (The Joker) imagination and my sister actually argues that the whole things was a dream!One thing I like about this movie is Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn, and the singing really added a new exciting element to the movie (Sinatra fan here). It's a pity the story just wasn't there to support it. It's worth a watch anyway just don't expect a lot.\",\n",

I still remember the goosebumps I had once I was done with the 2K19 version, not to mention the standing ovation crowd gave to Joaquin's performance that completely shattered everyone's impression that Heath Leager's joker depiction cannot be equalled.Just like Dark Knight trilogy I expected the creator to take this franchise a knot above but they completely failed everyone's expectations. Even Joaquin's performance and epic background score weren't enough to save this sequel. Lady Gaga is underutilised and is there in the movie just for the songs. Folie à Deux completely diminishes the legacy of Joker. Why make a musical to an epic and ruin the anticipation of fans???Although I would say it's a visual masterpiece, with many scenes that will make long lasting impression especially the one where Phoenix is escorted by prison guards and it starts raining and all guards open their umbrellas which are of different colors and Phoenix is standing in the middle drenching in the rain. These scenes will make you think how great this movie could have been.A huge disappointment for sure!!!\",\n",

Those who paid to see it shelled out $17. I would NOT recommend spending that much money. Also, I can't think of anything that happened on screen that justifies IMAX.I appreciated how they incorporated the musical elements. I wouldn't call it a musical in the Broadway sense, although there were some nods to that. The songs did reflect the emotions of the characters and weren't just plopped in to do musical numbers.The story does pick up from the first movie. In fact, several of the questions about the first movie were answered satisfactorily (at least to me). Unfortunately, I think this diminished the mystique (at least to me) of Joker himself. I did not care about him, or his journey, as much as I did in the first movie.I've got to say, though, that this ain't your Hollywood ending. Something is thrown in in the last scene that dropped my jaw.This isn't a movie you go to to be entertained. It provokes thought and discussion. At this screening, a group in the first row turned around and asked the rest of the audience what we thought. I put my head down and walked out because I wasn't sure what I thought. I'm still trying to figure it out. That makes it a movie worth seeing but not for full price.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"It feels like Todd Phillips hates that people really liked the first movie. It's as if he thought that anyone that liked Joker wanted to BE Joker. No Todd, the audience is smarter than that. You made an interesting empathetic character where we learn how a man could commit such evil acts. You feel bad for Arthur but we're not excusing his actions. Yet, some of those that didn't like the first thought you were promoting that behavior. Maybe, don't listen to the people that misunderstood your first movie Todd because it seems like that rhetoric steered your decision making in this sequel.Technically, this movie does a lot right. The acting, score, cinematography, etc. Is all good. Heck, even a couple of the musical numbers are good. The idea of a musical has some potential, while not necessarily a take I'd go, a couple parts show how it could have been very interesting. The movie never commits to it though. So most of the singing feels routine and dull. Ultimately, the writing drags this movie down.Obviously, there was no plan for a direct sequel to Joker, but it was a huge success, therefore WB offers a big paycheck to Todd Phillips to make a sequel. So he creates a movie that no fan of the first movie wanted. Todd gets the last laugh because he's now richer and the punchline is the audience who spent their money to see this movie he knew most wouldn't like. Get it, it's meta, you shouldn't like this stuff, not what you expected, gotcha!\",\n",

They were self aware, stopping short of dragging on and giving an additional dimension madness amongst the looming destruction.The performances are solid all round. The pacing is calculated, allowing us contemplation on Arthur's character and what his new relationship with Quinzel will mean.However, despite what seems like a broiling build up to a cacophony of insanity, this film ultimately bails at its last hurdles and even puts to bed any expectations that another sequal could be the explosive conclusion to a trilogy. Where the original topped off with a bold and manacing statement, this one pulls away. Yet again, this seems entirely self aware. It's a subversion tactic that no one expected but no one wanted, either.We wanted Joker. We got Arthur Fleck.\",\n",

Me personally, I not only didn't mind the singing but I believe it did nothing to hurt the film. All in all, it was an enjoyable watch but given its predecessors success as a masterpiece with Oscar awards, it's no question why people are bashing on this film.

Probably would have been best just to call this joint the Clown and leave Batman's Rogue out of it.Funny thing is there was a lot of potential to appeal to Fanboys, but they did not take it, in a move that felt pompous on the filmmaker's side. If you hate comic book superhero movies that much then why'd you do one?I did not hate Lady Gaga's version of Harley Quinn, in fact overall her connecting story arch with the joker made this movie worth seeing, but still, this is not the original DC animated Universe version or the comic book version. Truly, this is someone else who may have been better received in another movie.And to think, my biggest worry going in is that i hate musicals and hoped if Gaga was doing some of it I would tolerate it. Not even worth mentioning it! It does not make sense why it even needed to be a musical. Were the musical ques met to metaphorically allow me to enter the heads of the two main characters or was it a poorly done trick to make a film seem artier and more interesting? Definitely both!Sometimes lighting can't strike twice and the funniest thing about this film is how far from the mark they missed it!Don't sit through this.\",\n",

I don't mind the singing/music, I think a few were out of place, but otherwise okay to give atmosphere.So the main character was missing - Fleck's development was a psychologically, exciting drive in Joker (2019), and there was also action, but here things almost came to a standstill.So basically lack of action - and the absence of the main character in Joker-apperance.The acting was great, but the screenplay nothing like the first movie.Was this a villain in a superhero movie from Gotham city?

If anyone watched the interviews and with Tod Philips mentioning he had NO PLANS of making a 2nd film neither did Joaquin.But they took a different approach and honestly to me who loves the first this movie makes perfect sense.Some ask where the story is? Are you even watching? Or are you just criticizing every scene and not letting yourself go?Anyone knows the comics and these two relationship shouldn\\'t have expected anything different or new.It\\'s a live action, dark comedy, drama, crime and psychological film.He was captured and put into Arkham Asylum/Hospital in the end of the last one.This shouldn\\'t be news to anyone that you are viewing someone\\'s life via an insane asylum for an entire movie and getting their perspective. The musical elements are mentioned as to why they are used in the movie as well at Harley\\'s class, they use music for a form of therapy and it makes sense.The entire movie is his life in the asylum lost and trying to cope with whatever his life was. Then he finds love and has meaning again in his life and they use a musical to portray his feelings and her\\'s. They are both in a hospital and playing out their fantasies for the most part in their minds so why does that not seem like a good way to approach it?It builds up towards the third act and the last bit is super sad but when and IF you can open your mind and realize these are mental health patients expressing themselves then maybe you will understand and appreciate the movie better.I\\'m so sick and tired of movies getting hate and people find like 1 thing to make it sound like the entire movie is ruined because of it.I don\\'t care for musicals but I do for dark ones such as Sweeney Todd with Johnny Depp. If you enjoyed that one then you\\'ll enjoy Joker 2.This film almost could have been a stand alone to if it didn\\'t rely on repeating his crimes from the first film because even Arthur Fleck said he is done focusing on his past.Anyways that\\'s my two cents.

I don't know what your problem is, but chill out.The film was inconsistent, but the acting perfromances, Gleeson in particular, are what in my opinion set this movie from being average, to being a decent film. There's a lot of bad film. A lot of over the top super hero movies. It's almost refreshing to see a played out villain story where we expect so many things due to our familiarity with the adapted literature, turned into a boring court room drama with some musical components. Really subverted my expectations, and I found myself laughing at just the idea of that, which is genius, because the production company, had to know this would piss off so many nerds and incels and low iq americans who devour action movies like cheesburgers.The movie wasn't deep, im not saying that, but i did enjoy the critism of american symbolisation and fanaticism. I didn't love it, but I enjoyed my viewing. I tend to not love musicals and I didn't really like the first joker, but this one was funnier, more tragic, and a good fall date night movie to share and drink beers to.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Going by most reviews you may think this movie is worse than cancer...Coming out of the cinema theater, I\\'m no different from, perhaps, thousand other moviegoers who consider 2019 Joker a cinematic event in both themes and artistry.However, here in 2024, Joker 2: Folie à Deux Director Todd Phillips comes back with an idea that could\\'ve / should\\'ve been genius - what if Arthur Fleck\\'s Joker is the inspiration of the true Joker?This approach tries to break free from repetition when compared to any other comic film. The problem is, and this is the biggest oversight in Phillips\\'s way of thinking, that audiences worldwide chose Arthur as their new Joker.The idea of switching his creation for Christopher Nolan\\'s - and let\\'s not go around the bush, the Psychopath who ends Arthur\\'s life at the end of this film is none other than Heath Ledger\\'s Joker, is both clever and dumb. First, it makes absolutely no sense when we try to understand both timelines; Phillip\\'s Joker takes place back in the 1980s while Nolan\\'s Joker is thriving in the early 2000s. Second, minimizes completely Arthur\\'s journey leaving him as the pathetic disappointment that inspired the real Clown Prince of Crime.This also means that Ledger\\'s Joker was in his mid-40s??This opens the possibility of a third chapter, that according to Phillips will never happen; at least not with him as Director, where Harley Quinn returns to Arkham as the Psychiatrist she truly is after finding out that Arthur was slain by the new Joker - who is everything she wanted Arthur to be, but couldn\\'t.If instead of musical numbers, and slowly than watching paint dry sequences, this film would\\'ve included that ending - the ending where Harley meets Nolan\\'s Joker and their \"Folie à Deux\" connects. If I had gotten that this film could\\'ve been something truly special.At least to me.Unfortunately, we got this half-cooked thing that feels like a mockery, I think unintentionally, of what should remain as a film classic; 2019 Joker.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Rating: 6.6\\nOverall, a clear cash grab as this movie does not provide anything new or interesting to the universe and ruins the unique, open-ended brilliance of 'Joker'; but it is a decent watch for its cinematography, visuals, technicals, and acting.Direction: Pretty Good\\nThe direction on a macroscale is great as he uses cinematography and imagery to really paint the screen and build the world; the direction on a microscale is not that strong as it feels like it is kind of rehashing what they did in the last film, and the interpersonal scenes between Phoenix and Gaga were not that amazing; the storytelling is a lot less innovative as last time as they really don't subvert your expectations because the movie just goes through the progressions; the use of music and musical numbers to help tell the story was not that strong as it really only hurt the movie by moving away from what was going on; they build tension well as they still use score and cinematography to help with this, but it feels like this is just using experience from the last filmStory: Bad\\nThe concept is not that great; it is not that original, and really just feels like a cash grab; the movie does not really provide anything new to these characters and just shows why there should not have been a sequel; the idea of having this be a jukebox musical really kinda backfired in the end because it did not feel like it was executed well and took away from the charm of the first movie; the plot structure is way more linear this time around and pretty predictable, with the interjections in musical numbers being the only thing that deviates from the linear structure; the character writing is not that great this time around as it does not provide any additional depth to Arthur Fleck; it honestly makes his character worse as they took away a lot from what made the character interesting in the first film, and Lee really just feels like an uninteresting interpretation of Harley Quinn; this story really hurts the first movie as the predecessor no longer has an open-for-interpretation endingScreenplay: Pretty Good\\nThe dialogue is alright for the most part, but has a lot of corny and cringey lines that really stand out and make the movie feel pretentious; the humor is not as strong this time around, but does have some noteworthy moments; there are so many illusions and homages in this movie as the movie references like 'Singing in the Rain' and 'Psycho' while also referencing important historical trials like Ted Bundy and Billy Milligan, but it does so in a little too overt manner at times; the symbolism is not as strong as the previous movie as there really isn't anything to take away from this movie; the foreshadowing is not as strong as the first movie as they really plant seeds that never come out, kinda subverting our expectations by being predictable this time aroundActing: Good\\nJoaquin Phoenix: Good to Very Good (Uses a lot of his experience from playing to role to help define this character and feels like he never left in the more dramatic scenes, but does not really hold his own well in the musical numbers; does not have the best chemistry with Lady Gaga; does not feel like he was given as much runway to work with this time around)\\nLady Gaga: Good (Does very well in the music numbers and holds her own well; is not really given that much material to really show off and stand alone outside of Phoenix's performance; does not have the best chemistry with Phoenix)\\nBrendan Gleeson: Good (Has a surprisingly charismatic performance and has good chemistry with Phoenix)\\nCatherine Keener: Pretty Good to Good (Plays her role well and has good chemistry with Phoenix)\\nZazie Beetz: Pretty Good (Really just a cameo)\\nRest of the cast: Pretty Good (Supports the main cast well and shows the different faces of Gotham)Score: Very Good\\nStill has a lot of the same themes as the first movie and is still used to create tension, it is just used way less than the first movieSoundtrack: Decent\\nThe song selection was pretty good; it is just the musical numbers were pretty hit or miss; I enjoyed the grand dance sequence numbers that felt like non-sequiturs, but felt like the singing in the middle of scenes really took away from the filmCinematography: Incredible\\nThe best part of the movie, as I felt, was the cinematography; it really painted the screen with stunning visuals and was effectively used to display imagery to make this movie feel like an art piece; Some of my favorite shots were the 'Singing in the Rain' reference, the pills making a smile, the smile with the lipstick on the glass, and the courtroom scene where Arthur is out of focus but you see his face looking at the audience from the video-camera screen; The use of IMAX shots was done well as this was mostly used to show grand sequences, inside Arthur's mind, or the musical numbers; The color grading was really nice in helping show the dark, colorless side of GothamEditing: Great\\nUsed very well in conjunction with the cinematography to make this movie visually appealing and an art pieceSound: Very Good\\nUsed well to build tension and show some of the action sequences; the constant laughing and distant sounds in the background really helped us feel like we are inside Arthur's mind as he constantly hears thoughtsVisual Effects: Good\\nHelped paint the world of Gotham; the pyrotechnics and practice effects felt fine, but not that surprisingProduction Design: Very Good\\nReally enjoyed how they created Gotham (basically New York City) and Arkham Asylum; really enjoyed some of the sets for the musical scenes as they felt like they paid homage to the 50s and 60s; the production design as a whole did not feel as amazing/iconic as the last movieMakeup: Very Good\\nHelped paint and create the Joker and Harley QuinnCostumes: Very Good\\nHelped paint and create the Joker and Harley QuinnPacing\\nPacing was good for the most part, as the movie felt like it was getting through a lot of plot in such a short runtime; the climax could have been cut a littleClimax\\nThe climax was poorly executed, as it felt like it did not end the movie well, as it felt like nothing interesting happened; the sequel was definitely more straightforward and not as iconic or innovative as the first movieTone\\nTone is not good as it tries to be a musical while simultaneously trying to be an auteur-driven psychological thriller; the former really hurts the intentions of the latter as it does neither very wellFinal Notes\\nI really felt like this movie wasn't necessary going into the movie and I feel this way even more after watching the movie; this movie just feels like a cash grab as it does not provide anything new or interesting to the universe; the idea of having a sequel really hurts the open-ended nature of the first movie and kinda makes it worse in retrospect.\",\n",

This film is a musical, which gives it a cool twist, even if it's a bit dark. Some folks might say it's less dark than the first one, and I can see why. The first part really built up the Joker's character, but this time, it focuses more on Lady Gaga's character and how she connects with him.This phase is super important for the Joker because it shows how he'll become more wild. By the end, you get a hint of how he'll really let loose in the next movie. The film talks about serious stuff like mental health and how people treat each other, and it does it well. Plus, the music and the way the city looks are really impressive.I didn't see any big problems with the movie. It's strong and makes you think. Overall, Joker: Folie à Deux is definitely a must-watch!\",\n",

Lady Gaga's Harley is suitable as his love interest, and the musical numbers are poignant and well made.The film is something we don't get very often...it's art. It almost reminds me of the old 60's Batman episode where Joker paints a blank canvass and calls it art and wins a contest - it's just...art. The movie is art.The film completely flips the superhero/supervillain genre script on its head and commits to being a Broadway musical as Fleck deals with the repercussions of his actions in the first film and the madness of the forces battling inside of him and in the world around him. Who saw that coming?The third act of his movie could have been stronger and I would have rather set up a third Joker film - but I liked the way this movie took risks and committed to them and made something the world has never seen before.\",\n",

It was just the ending to me and the closing actions which really started to bore me purely because the ending was so rushed.

       "    'Review': \"Joker Folie À Deux is a bold and ambitious sequel and I really respect just how creative this film is. Just like the first movie Todd Phillips killed it in the directors chair and the cinematography is the most beautiful I've seen all year. Joaquin Phoenix returns to play Joker and he does a great job. I also really like Joker's character arc in this film of coming to terms with who he is compared to who he wants to be. Lady Gaga brought her phenomenal acting chops to her portrayal of Harley Quinn and she did a great job with what she was given. However she wasn't really given all that much. This version of Harley Quinn was inconsistently written and underdeveloped. Her motivation makes less sense as the movie goes on and the character really is Harley Quinn in name only. She doesn't really act anything like the Harley Quinn we have grown to know and love over the years. This brings me to my problems with the script in general. This is a movie that hits you over the head with what it's trying to say. This is a film all about Arthur Fleck growing as a person and trying to be more than the Joker persona that he used to start a movement. There is definitely some interesting social commentary but all the slow burn subtlety from the first film is thrown out and exchanged for loud and obnoxious messaging that feels like a script trying to check boxes and not a natural story. This is frustratingly obvious with the ending of the movie where one of Joker's followers feels betrayed and stabs him to death. I also don't understand why Harley Quinn didn't just kill Joker instead of that random guy. It would've felt more natural and personal while still representing what that message was supposed to be. The movie's pacing also feels off. I think a lot of that has to do with the musical numbers which just feel kind of pointless and unnecessary. Since the musical numbers don't add much of anything to the story they just make the movie drag. The music isn't very memorable or interesting which doesn't help either. However the musical set pieces look great. The production design is great all around, and same goes for the makeup. The costumes are hit or miss for me personally. The costumes during the musical sequences are pretty cool but most of Joker and Harley's outfits are kind of bland, especially the more modern take on Harley's red and black outfit. Overall this is a well made movie from most aspects of film making. While I don't think it deserves the immense hatred that it's getting it definitely has problems. The movie is focused on a messy script and the clunky pacing just highlights how messy it is. The fact that the first movie is so much better also hurts this movie a bit too.\",\n",

I would agree the first film is stronger it has a overall stronger direction I would say but at the same time I still enjoyed this film more than a lot of other people seem to. Joaquin Phoenix is really great as expected he was really great in the original joker film and lady Gaga did a pretty great job as Harley Quine she still isent as great as Margot Robbie's Harley Quine but she was really good and fit the film. This film definitely Doesn't have nearly as strong of a direction as the first one it kind of just keeps going and then stops and then goes again but it's still not bad I don't think this is that bad of a sequel.

I also enjoyed that it didn't take itself too seriously and was not just a traditional sequel to Joker.But they also sprinkled in some numbers that felt jarringly weak in comparison to everything else. You can't just awkwardly film Phoenix singing poorly and justify it being in a musical. It felt like they didn't know how to actually make a musical at times. Quality over quantity should've been the idea when it came to the songs.Also the ending was a giant middle finger. I'm not saying movies have to have the expected or happy ending - it's more interesting if they don't. But it felt like they didn't give care and just wanted to be contrarian. There was no intention to do anything meaningful with the relationship with Arthur and Harley.\",\n",

The acting from both Phoenix and Lady Gaga was good.I was previously aware that the movie was more or less a musical. I'm not a fan of musicals but I thought that using that to give the audience a sense of Arthur Fleck's confused state of mind fit. And it did work - to a point. However it was overdone to the point where it overshadowed the overall story. It reached the point where the continued musical numbers became tedious and boring. By the time the film reached it's conclusion I was no longer riveted like I had been earlier. I was pretty much bored and waiting for it to be done with.Story-wise, I felt that everything about it made sense. I just got the sense that the story wasn't told well.

       "    'Review': \"The Joker sequel has to be one of the least wanted sequels in a long time - and boy, is it unnescessary!When I first heard about them making a sequel and making it a musical I was sceptical but still curious with caution to see what they would make of it. The general idea of the jokers mind being portrayed through musical numbers was promising - and very much in character in my opinion. However, the execution of this film was far from great.Firstly, I want to applaud the performance once again from Joacquin Phoenix who still plays the roll of Arthur Fleck to perfection, he has not phoned it in for this sequel. Lady Gaga made a good contribution too - when she actually gets to act. She has unfortunately not been giving much to act on and the focus is more on the musical aspects, since Lady Gaga is a musician after all. She is a great actress and it's a shame they didn't let her act more.The cinematography, lighting and assets, choregraphy and music is great in this film.Where Joker: Folie a Deux really stumbles is in the story department. It really adds NOTHING new to the first film, it's basically the same film as the first one retold. Todd Philips does NOT know how to make good sequels, it seems. An example I can think of is The Hangover films, who did not need sequels, and once they came out, they basically were the same films. No character progression, no additional story features that we did not already know about, it has NO substance what so ever. It's a shame because the musical aspect is really interesting to me. Unfortunately, the story falls flat, does not add anything and the musical numbers also felt quite abrupt at times, like they were just thrown in there for the sake of a musical, which ruined the pacing as well.This film is not as bad as people depict it to be, however. It's an all right enough film that unfortunately gets bogged down by the awful writing, pacing, and general direction. The ending of this film (no spoiler here) is also a very strange, and to be honest, badly written one. It felt like fan-fiction.It is completely unnescessary and should not really exist. If you've seen the first one, then you can expect that the second film is just the first one being retold through a courtroom drama / musical numbers. You won't get much out of it. I enjoyed it for what it was, even if it wasn't what I expected, and I don't think this movie is deserving of the low rating it has. It deserves at least a 6, which i base my rating on. I would give it a 6,5 but I can't rate it like that here.Short summary:Story - 2/10\\nMusic - 8/10\\nActing - 10/10\\nCinematography - 8/10.\",\n",

Lady Gaga was okay in the film. The tone and the atmosphere in the film was the same as the first.Making the moving musical made sense to me because of how Arthur Fleck interacted with music and how he imagine stuff in the first movie, in the stairs scene or the show scene. Also there is some perspective in the society side is that Joker now is the entertainer and the hero to them so that's why Arthur was imagining himself as an entertainer. The music choice was great and it wasn't too much or little it was perfect.Todd Phillips should've wrote the Harley's story more we didn't see why she want to be with the joker. The writing didn't gave Gaga an opportunity or justice to deliver a good performance during the film. The idea of she doesn't want to be with the Joker because Arthur doesn't want to be the Joker anymore is brilliant but the delivery was so bad and rushed. That shows that Harley loves the joker not Arthur.The trial scene was great and one of the best in modern cinema and again Joaquin did an outstanding performance.Another thing in the movie is that they don't show us more of the Arthur they only show us little bet of what his mom thinks of him but I felt I wanted more. The movie felt like it doesn't have that core but there is some messages and meanings but it lacked the core.The ending was one of the worst ending ever I have ever seen because the ending was missing a conclusion I mean poor Arthur what he has done to deserve bad writing from Todd like that. At the end watching that ending made me saying that we didn't need a sequel in the first place I give the movie between 6 to 7.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I knew from the moment I saw the trailer and heard it was a musical that Joker: Folie à Deux wouldn't match the first film. The movie is very slow paced at times and the story is kind of messy and all over the place. Also, like the majority of people, I think the musical aspect of the film was very unnecessary. I don't hate the idea of putting 1 song (2 max) in the film because I do believe that's something Joker would think of in his mind while he's not in touch with reality but it felt like there was a musical number every 5 minutes and it gets old fast. I believe there was 15 songs in the film. Warner Bros. Was scared to market this as a musical so I'm not sure why they took that route to begin with. However, there are great things about this film like the cinematography and the wonderful acting by Joaquin Phoenix, just as we saw in the first movie. Lady Gaga was very good in this as well but I thought her character was underutilized, so much more could've been done there. If you loved the first Joker, you still might like this film. I'm kind of in the middle, I don't dislike it but it's nowhere near the first. It's not one I'd rush out to see right away.\",\n",

The musical sequences fit well, and while they're not as excessive as people claim, they add depth to the story.

As with the first film this sequel is dealing with some serious mental health issues. After I saw the first one I remember thinking, \"I don\\'t want to see Batman punch this guy, I want to hug him\". It\\'s the same here. It\\'s hard to look at Author as a villain.

       "    'Review': 'Let\\'s begin by saying that this film is nowhere near as bad as many as insisting. The original Joker is a stand-alone masterpiece that didn\\'t need a follow-up but was forced to have one due to it\\'s colossal financial success. That accepted, Todd Phillips appears to have been of the attitude that, \"You want a sequel? I\\'ll give you a sequel!\" approaching this second flick with the same anarchic irreverence that Arthur Fleck himself might approve of.What we end up with is a bizarre love-story musical / courtroom drama hybrid, interspersed with show-tunes and dance sequences imagined by Joker as he enters the throes of love, having finally found a soul-mate (or so he thinks). The problem is that few of the musical numbers propel the story forwards or even add to it, not least of all because there\\'s very little story to shift. There\\'s an amusing rendition of \"If My Friends Could See Me Now\" and a genuinely poignant and fragile version of Jacques Brel\\'s \"If You Go Away\", but Lady Gaga is pretty much under-used, and Phoenix is certainly no singer.In terms of drama, the film merely treads water, though the scenes outside the courtroom and prison smack beautifully of the same dark, dank imagery used so superbly in the first film. What this means is that we have some excellent atmosphere but no real substance, at least for most of the 140 minutes on offer. For much of the time, the audience is left intrigued by certain ideas - about where the film might be going - but so much is left unrealised, that a sense of disappointment is probably unavoidable.However, the real reason why Joker: Folie a Deux might leave lovers of the first film so disillusioned is that the former undoes much of what Joker presented. If Joker was the tale of a desperately unhappy, abused and lonely man finally finding his voice and identity through his own insanity, this sequel drags Arthur back to reality - to the point where he has to face who and what he actually is. In that respect, Phillips, Phoenix et al deserve huge credit for an audacious attempt to give the public what the do NOT want - to make even the biggest fans of the first movie realise that they weren\\'t watching what they thought they were watching all along. That alone is an incredible attempt at something different and deserves credit.Does the film succeed? Not really. There again, to quote Malcolm McLaren, \"Better to be a spectacular failure than any kind of benign success.\"',\n",

       "    'Review': 'After watching this film most like me will say that director Todd Phillips took a different approach from his 2019 original. Picking up where we left off Arthur Fleck(in another good turn from Joaquin Phoenix) is in prison at Arkham awaiting trial. However aside from seeing his identity issues between his self and \"The Joker\" themes are introduced of love and music. In a wild card like way is character Lee(the talented Lady Gaga) who\\'s given Arthur the hope and fantasy of love while introducing him to music which is like an escape for Fleck. While all of these themes play out the film has plenty of flashbacks and foreshadowing as Arthur sees it all in the form of his \"Joker\" past and present. Overall any \"D.

Joaquin Phoenix rightfully earned his Oscar for the role.So now we have a sequel. \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" works best when addressing the criminal (in)justice system. The musical scenes, meanwhile, look out of place for this kind of movie. There are plenty of movies where it works perfectly for the characters to break out into song - even movies dealing with an unpleasant topic - but it doesn\\'t add anything here, even with Lady Gaga giving it her all as Harley Quinn.In conclusion, it\\'s not a terrible movie, but still no comparison to the original.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"I just got out of Joker: Folie à DeuxThis isn't a disappointment. It's a bad movie, full stop.Todd Phillips has massively dropped the ball. Everything that was great about the first movie, is missing here. The first movie was meant to be a stand alone movie. But when it made as much as it did. Money talked and it may have talked about making a deadline for the release date, as this is a mess.I don't read or watch reviews before I watch a new movie. But I seen a headline that said Joker Folie à Deux feels like it was bad on purpose. And I get what they mean as it seems Phillips is angry at the fans for making the first movie so successful. He has deliberately gone out of his way to make a movie, they will not even like, let alone love.As what we get is a boringly paced, badly edited, totally unfocused movie, that never gets going, lacks any clear direction (it's all over the place) with a script that needed at least another rewrite.I love a good musical. But the musical sequences in this, stop the movie in it's tracks. They do not belong in this movie. Take them out and you have a better movie. I'd say it's 50/50 songs and dialogue.I think a lot of people, especially people who loved the first movie, are going to hate this. As Phillips totally tears the character of Joker down in a lot of ways.I will say it looks gorgeous with some sticking images and it does have some moments of genius and real standout moments. I think everyone will agree on what the stand out moment of the movie is.Joaquin Phoenix again nails it. Lady GaGa was great too, very charismatic, in a very poorly written role (she doesn't even really become Harley Quinn. She is very unlikeable and downright cruel.I think she has been the victim of some last minute editing, as the ad campaign make this seem like she is co-lead. That is not the case at all. It's a supporting role. A lot of her stuff has been cut from the finished movie. The title doesn't even make sense Folie à Deux translates to a shared delusion. That is not this movie. Arthur and Lee share very little.Brendan Gleason is great too, but when isn't he??They should have turned down the money and kept it at one movie.\",\n",

His lawyer, \"Maryanne Stewart,\" played by Catherine Keener, is trying to get a responsible defense against the prosecutor, \"Harvey Dent,\" played by Harry Lawtey.The guards in \"Arkham\" can be hit or miss, but correctional officer \"Jackie Sullivan,\" played by Brendan Gleeson, gets \"Arthur\" in a class where he meets fellow patient \"Lee Quinzel,\" played by Lady Gaga.You watch as the trial of the century takes place in \"Gotham.\" Along with how \"Arthur\" wrestles with a mix of emotions and his fandom. All while falling in love with \"Lee.\" In this musically inspired sequel.\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" was a tease. It had the template for something magical. I mean, you saw the first film. But this one dropped the ball overall.I\\'m not a huge steak eater. But I hear the true steak lovers say if you have a good steak, you don\\'t need A1 sauce on it. The first film was a tomahawk; they just needed to cook it the same, maybe add some different sides. Instead, they added a crap ton of A1 sauce and drowned out the whole steak. You could taste how good the steak was in spots, but your taste buds would get thrown off by the mouthful of A1 sauce you were consuming.I get it. Todd Phillips isn\\'t following the comics per se. He made the first film about mental health. It was a unique and real take on a villain we all know. In this film, with Lady Gaga, I was so excited because she can act with the best of them. We saw how the first film ended, so I expected or at least wanted them to terrorize the city together.Todd Phillips went in the exact opposite direction. I did not like his creative vision for this film. At all. When I heard it was a musical, I was confused. This just seemed like adding something unnecessary to an excellent film already.Every time I got into what was going on, then a random musical number would appear. It got annoying. Some of the music went along with the flow, but others derailed the pace and feel of the scene. The acting was so good I wanted to see more, especially at pivotal moments. Just for me to constantly get something that didn\\'t fit. It\\'s a lot of music. Joaquin Phoenix can hold a note. But I just didn\\'t think this film called for it.If the first film is about becoming \"Joker,\" then this film is about returning to \"Arthur Fleck.\" They had some really good ingredients in this film. You could tell they paid a pretty penny to film it. I didn\\'t like the vision for \"Harley Quinn.\" I mean \"Lee.\" I liked them adding \"Harvey Dent.\" He was a tool, by the way.I\\'m not a huge musical fan. I still could appreciate some of the musical numbers. But you\\'re alienating a huge chunk of your original fan base to make this move.Overall, the acting is phenomenal; you just wish they focused more on that than the music. Joaquin said it was hard to film because losing weight was fine, but now adding all this dancing and singing makes it extremely hard to film.Lady Gaga said she had to switch her singing voice up and sing with a completely different tone. You could tell, but her iconic sound still came out a couple of times.It\\'s not all bad, but it\\'s far from great too. Mental health is a huge component of this film. It was still extremely deep. The music isn\\'t bad; it just felt unnecessary. If you enjoy musicals, you will probably like this film.By the very end, I expected any scene I loved to get ruined by a musical routine. I was over it and kind of down on how it ended. Todd Phillips had a masterpiece. If they were going to go so drastic then they should\\'ve done it the first film or just not do a second film. A decision I know they wish they could redo. Someone should have said, \"Hey, you know you don\\'t have to add all this extra stuff, your meal is already delicious\".

It Is genuinely a very well made movie, the visuals are gorgeous, the score and editing I found to be fantastic, I did like the dark tone this movie had, similar to the first. There are also scenes in this that I thought were good. The performances were especially fantastic, even with the weak script that the actors had to work with, the performances, manly Joaquin Phoenix's performance felt oscar worthy. I wouldn't put this movie near the worst comic movie ever made because the movie at least felt unique.I do have a lot more to say about this film but overall, Joker: Folie a Deux belongs on the long list of disappointing sequels.Overall Score: 65/100.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'To be honest, I only watched Joker 1 because of the reviews people were given for Joker 2, and I wanted to see why people were upset.Author Fleck in the first movie was a mentally ill man who even though he kills six people he exposes the hard life people in Gotham City deal with and how they largely have no chance of living good lives. It\\'s understandable, personally the Joker character is not my type, but it was a good watch.Author is now in prison and is on trial for his murders - did he commit his crimes due to insanity (multiple personality disorder) or did he act with a sound mind and should be executed. Okay simple enough story and personally would have enjoyed a story where they sat in the court for the whole 2 hours discussing the matter similar to how the 12 Angry Men (1957) was directed however they went another way.Before Author attends court, he meets Lee Quinzel, who claimed she had been abused and was put in a mental prison by her crazy mother, they bond over this and make plans that once Author is out, they will live a good life not worrying about the craziness around them. Again, I would have been fine with this even though I could not care less about a love interest, and I seriously don\\'t understand how she truly fits into the story. Lee Quinzel is comparable to tumble girl crazy - had a good upbringing, has a good life but wants something exciting and thus wants to be around actual hard-on-their-luck people to feel like them and be them. Which is why I don\\'t like her; her insertion does not completely flow unless we are looking at an angle of the rich wanting to cosplay the poor or exploit them.Which brings in another part the singing, why was there singing I don\\'t know. Yes, Author liked music however it wasn\\'t necessarily a big part of Joker 1, mainly it was the song \"that life...\" which was used as an emphasis on his horrible life (and for him to dance around - which made him look free in Joker 1) but in this movie, singing is seemingly an integral part like it a musical however it misses a point in that during a musical number we move from scene to scene the songs flow into the next scene - they essentially take out the dialogue and replace it with singing and it transitions (whilst explaining) to a different scene. But here they talked about something and then sang the about same thing and stayed in the same scene PLUS they often sang the \"same songs\" (songs that had the same idea all the time - so it became annoying and repetitive). So yeah, singing was completely unnecessary and did not match the tone of the movie.And then the ending - okay interesting but I kind of did not care after watching 2 hours of everything else.Overall, I did not like the movie. The acting was good, everybody did their job. The singing from Lady Gaga was good (of course) but I did not care for the Author\\'s singing. I do not know what I was expecting but possibly Author working on his comedic material and acquiring a better community inside prison. Or maybe replace Lee Quinzel with Ricky where Ricky does not look up to Joker and rehabilitate together or something because he kept showing up but nothing much to his character.I do like the fact he was made into a \"normal person\" as I do feel like some people overly interpreted Author in the first movie as their hero who stood up against \"the big dogs\" where in reality even though he did do that; he did it because he was being provoked or abused, the man is the definition of what happens when social services don\\'t do their job or funding is cut. He was not a Giga Chad.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"No Spoilers...\\n5 years ago JOKER was released and it became an phenomenal sensation throughout the world for it's unique take on character showing harsh reality of this world in a bleak and violent story about an mentally ill character, it was a masterpiece but after that film earned 1B WB forced a sequel that shouldn't have made in the first place..\\nThis film continues the story from 1st film but didn't deliver what it promised rather it becomes a meta movie which mocks the character and audience instead of progressing the story in a meaningful way.. Joaquin pheonix still manage to deliver a steller performance and Lady Gaga was also good but film fails from a storytelling point where nothing really happens which makes audience feel the same way they felt in 2019,Harley Quinn is barely present and appears only here and there only to manipulate Arthur which let nowhere at the end..Arthur is now imprisoned in Arkham Asylum and waiting for his trial where he meets Harley Quinn but after that it becomes just some fantasy filled musical sequences and courtroom drama with an lackluster climax which destroys the legacy of the original film and the character shown in that,maybe a film about Joker and Harley escaping and doing crazy acts would've been received better .. Now I don't have any problems with musical numbers and court room drama scenes were also we'll acted but joker was more of a plot device than an actual being here.. This film should have been about Joker and Harley doing ultimate madness which delivers on its Foile à Deux name which means madness for two.. Twist ending was good but it feels forced instead of earned there were also some deeply disturbing scenes like the first one and dark beautiful cinematography and haunting score is what keeps this film together.. It also makes a point that people will only love you when you act like their own will but if you don't they'll abandon you, and that's what it happening in this movies in real world also audience wanted a Joker who goes on killing spree and doing ultimate madness associated with character instead they got another character study of an mentally ill man that's why the hate.. But Todd Phillips should've known people have already seen this aspect of story 5 years ago and rehasing the same old character study theme won't settle well with audience because they want something new not some old boring crap which didn't even matched the half level of the previous film.. Overall Joker 2 is a good film which completely falls flat due to uninspiring story and over the top deconstruction of the character no one wanted at the first place it was a step backwards instead of going forward after setting up a good ending in the last one..\\nWB should have focused on the real sequels that fans want like MoS 2, JL 2, WW 3 etc instead they wasted 200m dollars at something which shouldn't have existed in the first place...Typical bad WB move.

       "    'Review': \"The image, photography, lighting, sound, colors, scenery, shots, symbols, focuses and blurs, interpretations, costumes, makeup and production are MAGNIFICENT. Explosive scenes both in their metaphor and literality, an amazing control of shading, lighting and color, which together with the photography, encourage and solidify my beliefs as to why this footage is an audiovisual marvel. Apart from this, the original plot feels almost empty, the only character I managed to empathize with was the dwarf who had lost his job (which is cool because he's a great character but in the first movie I was able to empathize in a certain moment with The Joker and his mother).The script is so basic that it is not even decent, lacking all that brilliance with which they showed off in the originality of the shots and symbols of abundant moral meaning. The film also fails to have a clear main reflection, no matter how good or entertaining the moments of the songs are, which are vaguely calming and in my opinion they put too much. Furthermore, the ending did not leave me wanting more, or even satisfied. At all. I was expecting a Joker madly in love with Harley, and of course they put him in, because he was already crazy before. The bad thing is that when he falls in love, the character loses all kinds of mischief, insight, and especially his instinct, one of the qualities that made this character such a charismatic icon.I liked it, undeniably; there were parts that I didn't enjoy as much as I would have liked, and they almost seemed tiresome, but the film kept its pace relatively well and it is worth seeing, especially for the tremendous performance of the aforementioned Joaquin Phoenix. He demonstrated, without a doubt, all the professionalism he possesses and how versatile he is.Conclusion & overall: underrated recommended movie. It's worth seeing and enjoying it without taking into account the first footage, because instead of giving you the somber vision that you expected from a story like this, so real and so painfully human, they decorate it with songs that, at least in my opinion, are half left over, if not almost all of them.For more reviews like this one, don't forget to follow. Thanks.Sincerely,\\nbiggest 446.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Todd Phillips\\' \\'Joker: Folie à Deux\\' boldly transforms the gritty realism of the first film into a musical. Set in Arkham Asylum, it delves deeper into Arthur Fleck\\'s psyche, now fully embraced by Joaquin Phoenix\\'s chillingly transformative performance as the Joker and Lady Gaga\\'s debut as Harley Quinn.The film\\'s ambition elevates it but unfortunately leads to its downfall. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s captivating and unsettling performance, coupled with Lady Gaga\\'s vocal prowess, creates a captivating chemistry, especially in the musical numbers. The choice of classic tunes and modern renditions offers a nostalgic yet eerie soundtrack.However, the decision to make this a musical feels misjudged. The integration of songs disrupts the dark, brooding atmosphere of the first film, serving as distractions rather than deepening the narrative. This shift in tone dilutes the original\\'s stark brutality, attempting to broaden its appeal but losing its impact.The story and direction are well-crafted, but the musical elements detract from the overall impact of the film.\"Phillips\\' visually engaging homage to classic musicals struggles with a cohesive narrative. The film\\'s excessive time in Arkham Asylum, while thematic, feels claustrophobic and repetitive. The plot, focusing on Arthur\\'s trial and his budding romance with Harley, lacks the societal critique and rise-to-infamy arc of its predecessor. Instead, it centers on personal madness and love, which is intriguing but doesn\\'t fully satisfy expectations.Criticism centers around Harley Quinn\\'s underdevelopment. Lady Gaga\\'s performance is magnetic, but the script lacks depth and backstory to fully showcase her beyond her musical talents. The film\\'s reluctance to fully embrace either its musical or dramatic elements leaves it in a thematic limbo. The potential for exploring the duo\\'s dynamic is partially realized.\\'Joker: Folie à Deux\\' is a film of contrasts: brilliant in its performances and musical moments, yet disjointed in its narrative and tonal consistency. It\\'s a daring experiment that, while commendable, doesn\\'t fully land. For fans of Phoenix and Gaga, or those intrigued by the unusual marriage of comic book adaptation with musical genre, there\\'s enough to appreciate. However, for those who found the original\\'s dark realism compelling, this sequel might feel like a step into a different, less satisfying universe. A 6 out of 10 reflects this film\\'s ambitious yet flawed attempt at combining the criminal with the carnivalesque.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Todd Phillips, I see you! The intention behind this sequel is so clear, and I believe that it was an organic continuation of the first movie. In my opinion, Arthur was never meant to be idolized, neither from the people in the movie, nor from the general public in the real world. It was not to generate a villain-hero, it was a commentary on social causes, on how society failed Arthur.This sequel remarks the idea that we all got the first movie wrong. It screams: it is not what you think it is, this is not what we should be talking about (semi-cit).Does this sequel add something to the story? No.Does something really happen in the movie? No.Was this movie necessary? Yes.Acting-wise, Joaquin Phoenix is superb! Lady Gaga, despite relatively limited screen time, since scene one is utterly credible in the role of an unhinged and dangerous narcissist.The only problem is: where is the folie à deux? This is probably my biggest critique to the movie. The idea behind the interaction of two main characters is very interesting, but I was left with the sense that it could have been explored more in depth.I wasn't sure about the musical aspect of the whole movie, but overall it makes sense and I believe it works well in setting the scene of complete delusions that the character are in. A few musical numbers felt a bit off tho, either in the placement along the movie, or because completely disconnected from the narrative. Whereas Phoenix's performance of 'The Joker' really is pure art.Overall, an Ok movie, with its highs and lows. Far (but not too far) from the first Joker. But ultimately directed to set the record straight.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker: Folie à Deux just had its premiere, and I have never seen so many people at an opening night. The line stretched all the way outside. Expectations were sky-high, to say the least! But how did people leave the theater? Many walked out feeling confused, and that\\'s understandable. The movie does something no one has ever seen before, and people certainly weren\\'t ready for it.At first, I was ready to harshly criticize it. But the more I thought about it, the more conflicted I became. There are two ways to interpret this movie/musical. One interpretation is that it failed. Failed to entertain the audience, failed to deliver what people wanted-especially for those expecting something similar to the first film. That\\'s because Joker: Folie à Deux chooses the musical format to convey its message. Now, that\\'s not inherently a bad thing. We\\'ve seen musicals that have done the exact opposite, like La La Land or Chicago. But here, even though the musical element is a core part of the movie, with Lady Gaga\\'s inclusion promising a spectacular show, it falls short of delivering on that promise.Gaga sings flawlessly, but it\\'s not the Gaga we know. It\\'s as if her larger-than-life persona has vanished. Meanwhile, most of the songs feel flat, not taking you anywhere, making you experience them as pauses in the story rather than moments of progression. Unfortunately, the story itself feels repetitive at times and doesn\\'t quite hook you in. Additionally, the chemistry between Joker and Harley Quinn is not what you\\'d expect-it\\'s weak. If the film had 3-4 fewer musical numbers (since some were genuinely worth keeping), we might be having a very different conversation. There are individual moments in the film that are brilliant, but they fail to connect with the rest, losing their impact within a broader, somewhat unpleasant whole.At one point, Joker says to Harley, \"Stop singing,\" and I think the entire theater collectively agreed with him. But that\\'s where the second interpretation of this movie comes in. With that line, it\\'s as if Todd Phillips is winking at the audience, telling us, \"I know you\\'re not having fun. I feel you. I\\'m not clueless; I know what I\\'m doing.\" And what he\\'s doing is as bold as it is necessary. He\\'s creating a new reference point in art. He sacrifices the mainstream success of his film to make a statement and leave behind something that we might never see again.Think about it-when will you ever see one of DC\\'s darkest villains, the Joker, in a musical again, and not in some indie production but in a blockbuster? In short, Joker: Folie à Deux may fail as a blockbuster, as a film for everyone, as basic entertainment, but it succeeds in shaking up pop culture. It might very well go down in history as a bold, audacious piece of art that inspires future creators to break the norms.Now that this movie exists, others can attempt to blend the most unlikely genres, hoping to create something extraordinary, a new hybrid. Joker: Folie à Deux certainly wasn\\'t that, though. But the start has to come from somewhere. So, I rate it a 6/10 as a viewer because it could have been much better, even in the format it chose, but as an art lover, I tip my hat to it for what it may inspire in the future.As for the ending, which many didn\\'t like at all, for me, it was the entire movie :)',\n",

This guy is just not capable of writing a really good, well-balanced and complicated script. Musical scenes, even though they're beatifully sang, feel very much out of nowhere and unnecessary. The whole court trial is a bad joke. And there are also a few plot wholes, of course.Phoenix is great again, maybe even better than before, but his role is much less flashy, so people will appreciate it less. Gaga is also doing a great job, but she has much less to do, that she should. The whole movie obviously looks really good and the technical side does the job.In the end, it's much more original and treats mental problems more seriously, but it's still a bit worse than the first movie.

       "    'Review': 'Believe me I would have loved to praise Joker Folie Á Deux as a cinematic masterpiece - like the first Joker film. I really would have. But unfortunately it is not.The main problem is the storyline. Despite of +2 hours runtime the plot can be retold in four short sentences. There really is not much to it. Sadly, because there was so much potential for shaping Arthur Fleck into the supervillain from the Batman franchise and complete the best origin story ever made.When you look at Joker: Folie Á Deux as an independent movie - and we have to, right? - there is barely no development in the plot. Almost no progression. It feels more like a brief postscript to the first film, than like a story in its own right. Like it is living on all the qualities we remember from Joker and not really taking us any further - not telling a new story.It could have been so great. Building on the storyline from the first film with its public riots. Where the rage and the anger was rising from the filthy city gutters. The poor, the working class and the mentally ill to start a rebellion against the rich and the powerful in Gotham City. Led by The Joker ultimately entering organized crime. A layered and complex story like a major jigsaw puzzle slowly assembled to fit in perfectly with the Batman universe. This element is totally missing in Folie Á Deux.All right then. Acting is still spectacular. Singing is great too. Arthur Fleck is the perfect protagonist. Brilliantly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix making the rise of the most unbelievable yet legendary cartoon supervillain a very human, emotional and social realistic story. All love and respect for the immensely talented Joaquin Phoenix acting with so much emotion and charisma - maybe the greatest actor alive.However, he cannot save this film which somehow seems fitted to Lady Gaga to quite a large extent. It\\'s a musical, and basically half the runtime takes place in the imagination of Arthur Fleck reflecting his profound love for the theatrical performance - and maybe continuing his tendency to engage in imaginary relationships? However, the singing scenes really don\\'t drive the story forward. They convey emotions. But they are sort of irrelevant with regard to the plot progression.One more problem: In the singing scenes Lady Gaga sometimes make it seems like, Joker is redundant and the only thing Joaquin Phoenix can do is raising eyebrows and averting his eyes. She steals the picture - for no reason other than \"we want some songs in the movie\".I hate saying this: But honestly, it gets boring on the way. I could not help but sigh with irritation when they began singing for the seventh time. The social realistic story of Arthur Fleck continues in the musical Folie Á Deux. But the sophisticated and intelligent origin story to the Batman universe got lost on the way.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Originally having no interest in the film, but getting curious due to the overwhelmingly negative reviews, I decided to watch Folie à Deux today to see what went so wrong. But ultimately, I don't think it's nearly as bad as people are making it out to be and I honestly thoroughly enjoyed it. However, it most definitely has multiple flawsNow, this movie is ultimately a courthouse drama, with basically only 2 locations during it's entire runtime. However, I personally found the story interesting and engaging enough to keep watching and not get bored. There are a few very questionable moments in the script though.The movie itself looks gorgeous. The cinematography and the directing was amazing and there isn't a single even remotely bad looking shot in this film. The acting from Phoenix is as outstanding as expected and Gaga also did quite well in my opinion.But where the movie fails, is that it's more of an epilogue than a sequel. There's not much new it puts on the table. Even Harley Queen seemed like an unnecessary addition that ultimately didn't matter. The whole movie is basically just talking about the events of the last one. There are some moments where it tries to show the consequences of the last film's actions (and I did like what they did do with that), but this aspect also seemed to be overshadowed by just recapping things that we already did see happen previously.The musical aspect of the movie is definitely something people are torn about, but I find myself in the middle of the pack. Sometimes the singing worked quite well in the context and the movie did have some fantasticly directed musical segments. But other times, this aspect felt too forced and just took you out of the mood. I also think they could've been built into the movie better. Instead of them being just day dreaming sequences, they should've tied them into regular scenes, like a normal musical would.People really seem to hate the ending, and I honestly don't get why. I thought it was (for the most part) a quite powerful, fitting and tragic end to the character. But it wasn't anything revolutionary or anything that would keep me thinking for more than an hour after the movie.In conclusion, there is a lot of flaws with this film and it could've been so much better. But I do feel like it's very overhated and I found myself engaged and interested in what was happening in the film. Despite the cons, I still liked the movie, but it is quite forgetable.\",\n",

People have complained about the music not fitting the scene, which is not true. Complaints of it just rehashing the first movie are fair criticisms. The complaints about no story or plot, are not fair complaints. The focus of the movie is the toxic love between Joker and Harley, and this movie plays with the standard weight of Joker being the more toxic aspect of their relationship. I think people don't understand that, most people don't understand that Harley and Joker are not a healthy couple. There is also going to be people who are sour on the ending, and the implications that are possibly made, which I won't spoil, but they are also fair complaints.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"After reading several bad reviews about this movie, I was a bit scared that I would be very disappointed. Luckily, I entered the cinema with an open mind and tried not to be affected by what most people were saying.The truth is, I was a huge fan of the first Joker movie and Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Joker was, and is, brilliant. Even on this second movie. That didn't disappoint. What I think is not everyone's cup of tea is the fact that there's a lot of singing going on and at times, I felt like it was dragged and forced only because we had Gaga in it. She's a great singer and a good actress but in my opinion, I suppose that all the singing is there because she's in it. It wouldn't be bad, if there weren't so many scenes with songs that cut the serious and darker moments of the movie short. ( And yes, I do like musicals!). However, I believe that, like me, most people enjoyed precisely that darker aspect and armosphere of the first movie in the first place.Also, although I understand that there needed to be an end to close the Todd Philips' Joker chapter, I didn't quite like this particular ending.All in all, I think it's a creative and brave attempt of the director but It was also a shot in the dark. It's one of those movies that you either hate or you are confused about whether you really liked it or not. Joaquin's astonishing performance will hopefully help you see that, in the end, it was a good movie. Not brilliant like the first one, but still a good one.\",\n",

Directed by Todd Phillips, the film ambitiously incorporates musical elements, adding a unique layer that may feel disjointed at times but showcases Gaga\\'s musical talent. Phoenix\\'s portrayal remains a masterclass, while Gaga\\'s transformation into Harley Quinn is gradual and captivating. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher and Hildur Guðnadóttir\\'s haunting score enhance the psychological tension, making this film a daring and artistically ambitious follow-up deserving of higher acclaim, even if the musical flourishes might not resonate with all viewers.',\n",

It was gut wrenching, sad and the acting is impeccable. Just amazing. Especially Lady Gaga. How can someone be so talented? It didn't seem as if they just casted her because she's famous. She genuinely is a good actress. I also liked that Lee was her own character. She loves the Joker but she isn't just that (a fact that I sometimes miss in other Harley Quinn interpretations).Brendan Gleeson is amazing as well and Joaquin Phoenix did a great job again.This film was a bit weaker than the first one but highly enjoyable to watch.Closer to reality as well as the other films surrounding the Joker story.If I knew before that this was some sort of musical I probably would have been put off by that too. But it makes sense and feeds the story. It's also fun and weird, just like Harley Quinn and the Joker.So: interesting and thrilling new take on a story that have been told a few times.

Phillips' bold choices don't all pay off, but they beat the fan-serving rehash that could have been. This quasi-musical courtroom drama is as deliberately obtuse and anti-crowd-pleasing as it possibly can be. Turning the whole Joker and Harley dynamic on its head and inversing their usual roles, Harley manipulates Arthur into the man she wants instead. It's a bizarre stroke of genius that works wonders when coupled with Pheonix and Gaga's performances. Uncertainty is the best element of the film, which sees the performances kicking off at angles when you least expect them to. The two take centre stage and deliver shining interpretations of these timeless characters, Gaga especially, such an inspired choice for Harley. Fantastic production design working in conjunction with the photography gives Director Todd Phillips a major helping hand, the musical moments do tend to come out of nowhere and stick out but I ultimately ended up liking the majority of them, the Hildur Guðnadóttir really did a number on this score. Laudable as the intentions of Folie à Deux may be, it feels thoughtfully but tiresomely stuck in the past. Still better than The People's Joker though...\",\n",

Now after the movie I'm still thinking about it and developing my own theories. The acting was excellent, even if the dialogue wasn't top tier, they made it work. Definitely recommend, but don't go in expecting something it's not. It's a movie that will make you think, not just have gratuitous violence for the sake of gratuitous violence.

       "    'Review': 'What starts out as a compelling and suspenseful psychological thriller loses itself in an unexpected transformation into a musical drama. The transition feels abrupt and misplaced, leaving the audience wondering what the film really wants to be.Yet the performances are phenomenal. Joaquin Phoenix once again brilliantly takes on the role of Arthur Fleck, a man who doesn\\'t so much embrace crime anymore in the chaos of his own psychological confusion. Lady Gaga, with her raw emotion and powerful presence, is a worthy addition, and together they lift the story to impressive heights. But even their phenomenal performances can\\'t completely save the changing pace and abrupt genre switch.Perhaps the disappointment for many viewers lies in what Arthur Fleck turns out to be. He is not the genius criminal mastermind we have come to expect from traditional antiheroes. Instead, he is portrayed as a man who is scarred to the core by trauma. Arthur is sick, deeply wounded, and his extraordinary ailments seem like nothing more than a failed attempt to cover up his unbearable pain. There is no plan, no strategy - just chaos and self-destruction.The film leaves you with a sense of oppressive unease, but perhaps that is precisely the point. \"Joker 2\" forces you to witness the pain of a man who is not a master of his fate, but a victim of his own mind. What the film seems to lack, however, is the balance between that inner despair and the societal responses to it, as its predecessor did so powerfully.\"Joker 2\" is a bold attempt, a film that is brilliant in moments but ultimately loses itself in its own experiments.',\n",

Striving for excitement and leaching off of one's pain, and their dive into murderous insanity and fascination they have for him, so much so that it propels Arthur fleck into embracing the joker persona...Harlee Quinn is one of those people.She's fascinated by the joker's chaotic murderous acts but wouldn't even bat an eye at the real Arthur fleck before the joker persona took over.The movie really shows how uncompassionate and inhumane society can really be.How humans can prop people up as some kind of superficial idol. And how quick we are to turn on them when they don't remain the plaything you wanted. It also depicts how detrimental mental illness can be.The music can be a little much at times, but it wasn't nearly as bad as people are saying. I saw a lot of reviews saying the music had nothing to do with the plot. It was very much a part of the plot if you pay attention. And in all honestly i wouldn't classify this movie as a musical its more of a thought-provoking drama with some singing here and there.All in all, i think it was a good movie that has you thinking at the end. And the ending of the movie in my opinion has fight club written all over it if you have seen it i hope you understand what im saying.Was it perfect?

The first film had a powerful narrative and character dynamics that deeply affected the audience, but this sequel doesn't create the same impact. It feels as if the director and the team made this film just to get it done, without any passion or creative energy. Given the success of the first film, audiences would have expected more from this sequel. Unfortunately, everything I watched felt lacking and disappointing.One of the biggest problems is the incredibly slow pace of the film. Of course, some films are deliberately slow to carefully build the story, but that approach doesn't work here. It takes far too long for the action to kick in, and in the meantime, the movie loses the audience. No matter how deep or interesting the story might be, if it drags on this slowly, viewers can easily lose patience. The first film had a rhythm that captured the audience's attention from start to finish, but this sequel struggles to maintain that rhythm. It feels as if the story and character development are unnecessarily prolonged. This doesn't make the film more engaging; instead, it turns it into a tedious experience.If I weren't a fan of musicals and dance, I would have struggled to give this movie even a 50 out of 100. There are some nice musical elements in the film, and the dance scenes make it somewhat watchable. However, these elements are not enough to save the overall tone of the movie. Unfortunately, even these scenes aren't placed in a way that matches the pacing and rhythm of the story. A musical or dance scene should energize the audience, but in this film, even those scenes lose their effect.The film's pace is incredibly slow, to the point where it's slower than what you would expect from a sequel. Usually, sequels pick up where the first film left off and speed up the action or plot progression. But here, it feels like everything that was built in the first film has been forgotten, and instead, it takes a step backward. In a movie that drags on this much, it's hard to keep the audience engaged. The story itself might be interesting, but when presented this slowly, it does nothing but lose the audience's interest.On the other hand, casting Lady Gaga was a good choice. When I first heard about it, I thought it was a bit risky, but her performance surprised me. The emotional depth and charisma she brought to her character helped salvage the film to some extent. She managed to build a nice chemistry with Joaquin Phoenix, and this is one of the film's strongest aspects. However, even this chemistry isn't enough to make up for the film's overall sluggishness and shortcomings. Gaga's performance is strong, but the disjointed script and pacing prevent her from truly shining.As a sequel, one of this film's biggest failures is its inability to sustain the spirit and energy of the first movie. The dark atmosphere and deep character explorations that were so central to the first film are almost nonexistent here. Instead, we are given a more superficial narrative and storyline. This makes it harder for the audience to connect with the characters, leaving a sense of emptiness by the end of the film. This is especially disappointing for characters that were so well-developed in the first movie. As a viewer, I wanted to see the characters evolve, but this film doesn't deliver that.In the end, this movie turned out to be a disappointing experience, one I had high expectations for. While there are some strengths, like the musical scenes and Lady Gaga's performance, overall, the movie falls short due to its slow pace, disorganized story, and inability to recapture the magic of the first film. If the pacing had been better managed and the story more focused, this film might have been much more successful. But as it stands, unfortunately, it falls far short of meeting the audience's expectations.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Don\\'t get me wrong, this film is by no means an outstanding sequel, but it makes a statement in its own right.The positives:\\nJoaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga\\'s performances were stellar, and the musical score added an ominous tone that fit the film well.Music:\\nSome viewers have complained about the disjointed transitions between the plot and musical sequences. I also found these moments quite jarring, but part of me feels this may have been intentional. The film is bleak and disturbing, and the musical interludes, while out of place at times, might have been meant to reflect that. However, the musical segments could have been trimmed, given the film\\'s already lengthy runtime. Songs like \"If You Go Away\" and \"To Love Somebody\" felt overly sentimental, in my opinion.Film duration:\\nThe movie is quite long, and some sequences could have been shortened. There were numerous drawn-out scenes of Arthur simply walking or staring out from inside a car, which slowed the pacing.Character development:\\nLee\\'s character felt underdeveloped. I\\'m not sure if this was the director\\'s intention, but it left me wanting more depth.In summary:\\nThis is an unusual film that deserved a stronger ending, though I don\\'t believe it warranted the level of criticism it received.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Back in 2019, Writer/Director Todd Phillips teamed with actor Joaquin Phoenix to create an interesting, dark, multi-level character named Arthur Fleck in JOKER. This character was so compelling that Phoenix (rightfully) won the Oscar for best Actor and Phillips (rightfully) was nominated for a Best Screenplay Oscar. So, what do Phillips and Phoenix do to \"up the ante\" in the inevitable sequel?Why, make it a musical, of course.Picking up after the events of the first film where Arthur Fleck is awaiting trial while incarcerated at Arkham Asylum for the murders he committed in the first film, JOKER: FOLIE A DEUX focuses on the relationship that Arthur strikes up with \"SuperFan\" Lee Qunizel (Lady GaGa) and the sparks and chaos that ensue.Or do they? For this movie focuses on the blurred lines of fantasy vs. Reality that these 2 live in - and the musical numbers emphasize the fantasy portion of it.One needs to be a very certain type of viewer to enjoy the musical aspect of this film - you need to be a Dark Comic Book Movie fan that also enjoys Movie Musicals of the 1950\\'s. This just happens to be me, so I really enjoyed the Musical numbers that were grounded in \"reality\" (at least, the reality of these 2 characters) while also helping to move the story forward and to enhance the characters and the relationships of Arthur and Lee.As for the performances, Phoenix is terrific (of course) as Arthur. The problem is that one is going to judge his performance against his previous, Oscar-winning performance and it just doesn\\'t measure up (mostly because of the script - more on that later). However, his singing is a pleasant surprise. Sure, at times it falls into \"talk singing\" (aka Rex Harrison in MY FAIR LADY), but Phoenix acts his way through the songs and the roughness of his voice in his musical numbers works for his character.However, Phoenix has an issue in this movie that he didn\\'t in the first Joker film, he has a VERY strong performer to work against and the performance that Lady Gaga gives as Lee just might be a Oscar worthy performance here. Her Lee Quinzel is layered, nuanced and interesting and (as one might imagine) she slips in and out of the musical numbers with ease and when it is her time to shine, musically, she shows that she is...well...Lady Gaga!Where this movie really fails, though, is in the script that Phillips wrote with Scott Silver. This film is, in essence, a courtroom drama - and a thin one at that - and Phillips and Silver just don\\'t have the depth of character or circumstance that makes one care much about what is happening on the screen and though Phoenix and GaGa try mightily to elevate this film above the thin script that they are given, this film ultimately, falls apart like a cheap shirt in the wash.And...don\\'t get me started about the \"deus ex machina\" ending that seemed to come out of nowhere!So...if you\\'re a musical theater and dark comic book movie person this film just might intrigue you, if not, knock 2 points off my grade below.Letter Grade: B (for me), probably a C for everyone else.7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to theBank (ofMarquis)',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie a Deux continues with the story of Arthur Fleck(Joaquin Phoenix), after the events of Joker(2019). Wrestling with his dual identity as the Joker, Arthur meets & falls in love with Harley Quinn(Lady Gaga), while serving his sentence at Arkham State Hospital.Joker: Folie a Deux is a pretty good film. It's definitely not terrible, like most critics & viewers are saying. Director Todd Phillips has given us a movie, that takes many bold swings by playing with multiple genres. However, it doesn't really commit to any single genre & that's the film's downfall. Making the sequel to one of the best character studies of a major comic book villain, a musical, was definitely not the way to go. The songs are not at all memorable & completely unnecessary. Each time either Joker or Harley Quinn break into song, I was just waiting for the song to end. The production design by Mark Friedberg during the elaborate song & dance sequences, are incredible & look even better in IMAX. Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal as Arthur Fleck. If Phoenix was given the same dark thriller genre that he had to work with in the predecessor, he would have knocked it out of the park. Because it's a musical, Joaquin Phoenix's performance suffers because, he doesn't really have flawless singing skills. Lady Gaga is spectacular as Lee Quinzel. Brendan Gleeson is great as Jackie Sullivan. Catherine Keener is superb as Maryanne Stewart. Zazie Beetz is incredible as Sophie Dumond. Harry Lawtey & Leigh Gill are perfect as Harvey Dent & Gary Puddles, respectively. The supporting cast is effective. Joker: Folie a Deux is worth a watch for fans of Joker(2019). However, keep your expectations super low. You will be disappointed but, at least you won't be extremely disappointed.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"The movie starts with a very random comic sketch written on Joker about him and his shadow and how it was his shadow all along who did all the crime and blamed it on him. The scene abruptly cuts to Arkham Asylum where Arthur Fleck is now on medication. He has no zeal to tell jokes anymore, maybe he gave up, or the medications were working on him.Later in the movie, he meets another cellmate Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga) and they started talking and he finds out how she is a big time joker supporter, and how she believes in him. Our movie starts with this one statement now, and the movie is all about how Arthur Fleck fights with his own reality.Coming to the performance, Joaquin Phoenix did it again, absolutely brilliant with his Joker and Arthur Fleck both. This time, a lot of things happened in his mind, rather than in real life but in different way and thay brings out the madness of his character. Lady Gaga on the other hand, could not show her acting skills much because she was busy singing everywhere abruptly which was not at all required to be honest.According to me, making it a musical was not at all a good decision, there was a lot of missed opportunities in the movie. When the story tries to grab you with the performance of the actors, somehow an abrupt song breaks the flow so even if the songs were beautifully written and sung, they were not at all required because they ruined the little left plot in the movie.The songs somehow drags the movie down because there could have been gripping and chilling dialogues instead which would have made so much sense in those scenes. It was 'madness of two' and all you can see is one getting mad, in all those songs, that is the audience.Overall, the ending will surprise you if you think about it in depth. The ending gives you the hint of the origin of the Joker we all know, we all love. In the end, the movie is not as bad as the people have told you, and not as good as you have thought it to be. It was a too flashy attempt to glorify an already successful movie and it went bad.Having all that said and heard, I want to tell you to watch the movie and decide yourself, if that is the Joker you really deserved?\",\n",

I will say the movie might surprise fans of the first movie because of some stylistic differences but those that can look beyond all the musical numbers might find a movie very similar to the first in terms of grit, acting performances and the anti-superhero movie character study style. I will say that the movie is good but not great, it is brutal shocking bloody and includes a very new version of Harley Quin that fits very well into the sort of movie that the Joker is. I think this might get more love from critics than fans because Joaquins performance expands to show musical theater chops in a way that we haven't seen from him before. There is a lot that is memorable with this movie. The shocking ending is something and though the movie is very much in the same spirit as it's predecessor it feels like a different kind of film.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Since the moment Folie à Deux was announced I feel like the narrative around it has been that it just didn't need to happen. I would combat that by saying no movie has ever had to happen, the first Joker didn't have to happen but in this movies case I just really struggled to understand the appeal behind continuing the story of that first film. There was just something so beautiful to me about Joker being its own self-contained story and I was mainly worried that the existence of this sequel would undermine so many plot points from the first film that would be better left ambiguous. It's a flawed experience for sure but I kept waiting for the moment that it would lose me and it honestly never came.I think a large part of that comes down to Todd Phillips' wholly unique vision for this movie. It by no means always works but it always kept my interest. Making this a musical is a bold idea but made total sense to me given how important music was to the first film. I personally liked that it was a jukebox musical, I thought it kept the tone closer to that of the first movie, and as obviously great as Lady Gaga was in those moments Joaquin Phoenix brought out that aspect of the character in outstanding ways. I just found those sequences to be inserted in really clunky ways and for as impressively realised as they are it just left me feeling like a lot of them could've been removed and it wouldn't really have affected the flow that much.Honestly I would say for the first hour or so I as totally onboard with what this movie was trying to do. Everything that takes place within the confines of the prison were brutally well realised and I feel like it gives us a version of the Joker we've never seen before. It made this movie feel more standalone and less like it's trying to retread the beats from the original. It's after the first hour, when we get more scenes outside of the prison where things start to become uneven. It essentially becomes 3 or 4 films in one and it massively bogs down the pacing. It can drag considerably because so many scenes feel like they're unnecessarily long and it made me not as consistently engaged as I wanted to be. The court room stuff took a while to become interesting for me but once it did I found a lot of the call backs to the first film to be more impactful and less like it was just a recap of events.I also don't know that I ever found the insertion of Gaga's Harley Quinn to be as successful as it could've been. I thought her and Phoenix had great chemistry and I always bought the connection between those characters but I never really felt like she came into her own. Her appearances become more sporadic as the film goes on and I kept waiting for the moment where she had a real impact on the actual events but it never came to be. I wasn't a huge fan of how her arc ended and I have to be honest and say that the final scene left me very mixed. It's a bold swing that did have an effect on me and I can see what Phillips was going for but nothing in this film or the first one leads me to believe that this is what they were ultimately building towards.From the moment Folie à Deux was announced I questioned if Joker really needed a sequel and having seen the actual film now I still don't feel like I have an answer to that question. It is a very interesting experience that mostly held my attention and I ultimately admired the story that Todd Phillips was trying to tell here. Nothing about this film offends me as a fan of the first but I couldn't help but scratch my head at some of the decisions that were made. For as many scathing reviews as this movie has been getting, I am surprised that I left feeling more positive than most. Maybe this movie should never have been made but for better or worse I don't think it's going to leave my mind anytime soon.\",\n",

However, I felt like Todd Phillips did a wonderful job crafting a true comic book movie here. The musical number cutaways not only made the movie feel more like a comic book but also depicted well the insanity of Joker and Harley Quinn, especially JokerI may be a little biased here because I enjoy musicals and comic book movies but, I would have thought less of Todd Phillips if he hadn't showcased the talents of Lady Gaga. This is a great movie, see it for yourself and make your own judgment. I'm happy as a clown that I did.\",\n",

This seems right. It seems to suddenly turn around and realize there was this trope behind the camera that it now sees, consequence. But it still stokes a little bit of the cult fire, even if it blows much of it out.I'm happy and proud to have watched it. It went a direction it should've.\",\n",

I believe it is a glimpse into a cross-section of society that is very well done and, from what I am seeing, successful in its purpose. I didn't love the musical, even more so the ending.

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux is a bit challenging to watch. Polarizing in the sense the film lacks the punch of its predecessor. However, it does excel in certain aspects.Set two years after the first film, the story follows Arthur, in a psychiatric ward and on trial. His life takes a turn after meeting Harleen Quinzel (Gaga), a fellow patient infatuated with his alter ego, Joker. Together, they spiral into a surreal, hallucinatory world, blending reality with vivid musical fantasies reminiscent of classic Hollywood musicals.Despite the singing and dancing, the movie struggles to be an effective musical.The story falls flat due to weak writing. The characters felt underdeveloped and the film's attempts at social commentary were kinda blunt, lacking the subtlety and depth that gave the first installment its emotional weight.Despite its shortcomings, Folie à Deux is not without its merits.Phoenix shines. Again. His performance is commendable; shows his incredible range and commitment to the character. Gaga was good and her singing was better. Their infusion in music sequences lends the film some quality, giving it the essence of a dark musical.The background score was really good, added another layer of depth maintaining the class of the first film. Although the selection of the songs were not on point and pretty forgettable.The background settings were satisfactory but could have offered greater variety, especially considering it is a musical.Cinematography was superb. Lighting, bursts of smokes/mists pound you with rich hues of blue, red, teal, yellow etc. All the while immersing you in some dark musical spectacle.Phillips has done well in directing a film that has great cinematography/visuals with splendid acting performances but could've given more in creating an engaging storyline. He has kept his standards though.Joker: Folie à Deux certainly lacks the spark of the previous film. It ends up prioritizing style over substance. Musical film fans would wanna enter with mild expectations but joker fans would be happy to see their character in all its glory. Nevertheless, quality acting, stunning cinematography, decent direction and a solid background score, make the film worth watching.\",\n",

Those scenes show him happy for once, in love, so the music fits his mood perfectly. This film isn\\'t really about the Joker anyway; it\\'s more about the symbol he represents. Plus, age-wise, Arthur\\'s too old to be Batman\\'s Joker. For me, it beats the prequel by about 0.5 points - more layered, more interesting.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux is a film with slightly different kind of musical elements. The film explores themes of myth, perception, rehabilitation, devotion, and self-sabotage. The plot of this film only discusses what happened after the first film, and in terms of execution it feels sloppy without a clear conclusion. There are too many musical elements in this film, but sometimes the placement and timing are not quite right, which disrupts the plot. We won't see the madness that we saw in the first film often in this film, it's only limited to Arthur's imagination. In terms of character development, it is like in the first film, only Arthur is having an identity crisis again. The cinematography is really really pretty, especially during the musical scenes, with the coloring making it feel a little colorful. In terms of production design, nothing has changed, it's still good. The soundtrack music is really pleasant to listen to, especially combined with the suspense scoring. Joaquin Phoenix's acting is definitely very good, and Lady Gaga's acting is quite impressive. Overall, this isn't a bad film but it's not good either.\",\n",

Now, his sequel is released reprising the role of Joker aka Joaquin Phoenix and newly added his love interest Harley Quinn played by Lady Gaga himself. I come straight to the point , i didn't find this sequel better than the original or came close to it. This is morely about a trail with the musical essence which was filled to the top. However, it is not bad i would say. I was expecting something else and they give us something else which is not settle in my vision. Although, the music was good , the direction was supremely good, but the writer fell short in the storyline i think i was a good plot about the trail and all but it will be sweet if it's done and sorted till the interval not stretched to the climax. As it is a musical one , it was beautifully executed. If i talked about the performance, they both preachingly delivers so good man. I have no doubt about Joaquin but Lady Gaga is so good performer too. Exceptional. As its starts you will fall into their world of joker. Simply outstanding. But came up short with the plot and the elements. Not a masterpiece like the Joker (2019) but a decent one.One Time Watch. Recommended.\",\n",

This movie isn't perfect at all and neither was the first movie, but this movie has soul and artistry. This clearly wasn't just some product pushed out of a machine like wonderbread. There was someone behind this that clearly cared about the end product. Look, maybe you don't like musicals, that's okay. Maybe this movie isn't for you. Not every movie has to be for everyone.The songs in this are fun and mesh very well with the time period. Joaquin phoenix puts on yet another great performance along with a very good performance by lady gaga (I never thought I would type that). I do wish there was more mind-bending segments and social commentary like there was in the first movie admittedly. Maybe if they were included alongside the musical numbers it would be too much.Ultimately, I liked this a whole lot. It had its issues that held it back from being an 8 or a 9, but it takes a lot of guts to make a sequel that isn't just more of the same.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie a Deux really doesn't deserve the hate it's getting. Sure it has it's issues, but for the most part it is a very solid if slightly unnecessary sequel.The biggest issue with this film is most definitely the story. It is painfully long considering it is devoid of any significant meaning or drive. I think it meanders far too much and doesn't add much to the first film. When it finally does get down to its point it is too rushed and as a result loses most of its impact. I was expecting a film bringing Harley and Joker together on screen in a grounded setting to lead to a more interesting story, and I think they missed a trick here.What really can't be faulted with this film though are the performances of Phoenix and Gaga. This is no surprise as they are both brilliant, but the chemistry they share is also incredible. Everything they did with these characters from the design to the creative choices I thoroughly enjoyed.Then there's the musical element. Perhaps people were unprepared for a musical? The patrons of the theatre I was in certainly were, as every song outbreak was greeted with audible signs and murmurs. Personally I thought this was one of the best parts! Lady Gaga singing? What's not to love. And the musical element just really works for these characters and the relationship they had and really complimented that well. A bold choice but one that really worked for me.Aside from the lacklustre story I really don't understand the pile on for this film. Great characters and performances, inventive storytelling with the musical elements, and a good tone and vibe to the whole thing.\",\n",

Then he finds out that it was really all a show and did it purely for others but never for himself. That is for me the reason that i think its a good movieThe funny thing is that in the first movie you really get to know him as a crazy man with very weird twists. But in this movie you're kind of used to him and he suddenly becomes normal. I wonder if people like that or not.And in the end; he is a good actor.\",\n",

Joker falls madly in love with her and fantasizes about getting out of jail to have a life together; however, she ends up breaking his heart by rejecting him towards the end of the events.I personally think that this sequel of the Joker disappointed many for not continuing along the path that characterized the first one, that is, we practically see no scenes of violence or where the Joker gets upset. Let's remember that his defense mechanism to escape reality is fantasy with Harley and singing.We have a Joker anesthetized by love who is capable of doing anything to satisfy his partner's desires.I think that the singing scenes, particularly the duets between Joker and Harley, are well done and contribute a lot to the story; they make a good couple on screen.\",\n",

The songs get more dramatic and crazy as the film goes on and I think this was a very good way of showing just how crazy Arthur truly is. To add, the performances of the musical scenes of these films are purely brilliant. Lady Gaga shows just how much of a talented artist she is and Joaquin Phoenix truly holds his own.Although the ending has been seen as disappointing by some, I think this ending opens up this story to be expanded even more and for us to be opened to a new world of The Joker.Overall, Joker Folie à Deux is a very entertaining watch with strong lead performances.

It was good in the aspects it always was. Though this is a sequel, we really shouldn\\'t be comparing this with the first Joker. Folie à Deux embraces the road of sharing trauma and how to deal with it correctly while focusing on a romance between the leads. When I say it was visually amazing, I mean it. The film perfectly captured the acting, the visual essence, and its expectations the first film had set. There were some scenes that screamed \"mind-blowing,\" and the music. Oh God, the music. Was the music good? Sure. But was it too much? Oh, absolutely. The music was too much. TOO MUCH. Don\\'t get me wrong, yes, I love the different take on this movie by adding original songs. But they overdid that by jamming it with songs that weren\\'t needed in certain scenes. Not every scene needs a song. I\\'ll try to phrase it without spoiling. Joker: Folie à Deux is, in itself, amazing. The visuals, the acting, the score behind, the sets, even the dialogues maybe. But the songs were a bit too much in terms of quantity. No hate to the creators, but honestly, it ruined the entire experience. I believe taking a more selective approach could\\'ve been stronger, letting the story breathe with the right dialogue moments. Oh, and there\\'s the big miss that the writers did. The first film was about how Joker symbolized the struggles of the common or the low folk, while in the sequel, you stripped him of that title. This made absolutely no sense in any way, and this is the one thing that acts as a complete opposite to what the first film stood for. But hey, all this is my opinion. Some might like the movie, some might not. It\\'s the whole point of a review that it\\'s your own opinion.I would give it a 7.8 out of 10.',\n",

I know this doesn't stand high as the OG Joker but but but the amount of hate this film is getting is too much I would say it wasn't a disaster but also not as outstanding as the first part. I love the creative choice of Todd Philips wanted to add some drama in the life of Joker as to express his dramatic life but the music it didn't go well sometimes it hits us but mostly i was getting annoyed that plan was good but the execution wasn't up to the mark. As we see in LaLa Land the music takes the movie forward as the story line and each music had its own way of expressing the story but here it fails. Besides the creative choices talking about the story, the plot the story was the X factor here whether it was Joker or Arthur Fleck who committed those crimes whether the Joker is a fiction in Arthur's mind or is it the real Arthur the movie puts you in this dilemma. I think the makers should have focused more on this aspect than putting unnecessary songs. And the ending was too confusing and a cliffhanger it forces you to think whether Joker is a person or thinking/character/a symbol/an image. All in all if you are expecting any more drama than the actual plot I wouldn't recommend it but if you love to think from the makers or the directors perspective what they want to convey through that story then you should go for it.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Folie à Deux is not so much a double madness as it is a madness reversal.The success of the first Joker lies in the fact that its dark representations and interpretations profoundly elicit the dark side of the public's heart. When people see their dark side, fear and have to face it. The Joker is the best point of expression, even its dark influence far beyond the director and the main actor's expression. Then the subsequent fear has to be saved and glorified by the director and production attempts.Although it is said to be a double madness, it is actually the first step after the Joker's madness controls Arthur, the director wants the second madness to be Arthur controlling the Joker back. But the director and production underestimated the reality of the darkness. This attempt to return to social normality was not accepted.Or the viewers who came to watch Joker 2 to challenge their values by making it even darker were forced to go back and watch the reversal. It's madness on the part of the director, but it wasn't accepted.What I saw was the director and producer's fear and redemption of the impact and deep darkness of the first movie.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Same vibe as the first one. Making a movie about what society makes you feel sometimes when nobody really cares about what you are really saying and feeling, feeling like you are not really heard by anyone. This one is more about a love story that many people can relate to; when you meet someone who sees you, hears you, and is able to read you like you always want to show to the real world. This person sees the true colors of yourself. It\\'s called love. This carries a profound message like the first but with a different touch that makes it comforting.The filming of the movie is sublime, and you can clearly see the high budget they had with these shots. Joaquin was perfect again in the role, and it\\'s easy for the viewers to have empathy with this character. Lady Gaga was a nice addition for sure, for her voice alone but sometimes it was too much... Let me explain.I feel like it was a \"dramatic musical movie.\" At certain times, it makes you feel like they just want to show off Lady Gaga\\'s voice when it wasn\\'t really needed in the scene. Joaquin has this aspect too. I found many times that I was bored by that aspect during the film. Don\\'t get me wrong, I like some musical comedies when they are done at the right time and the movie is directly going for that direction, but I really feel like Joker Part 2, a DC movie, was not really the place to show as many musical scenes like that. I mean, I\\'m pretty sure if they replaced these parts with real conversation and profound scripts that add more value than just songs, it would be a far better movie. I haven\\'t read any reviews yet, but I think I\\'m not the only one who thinks that. Besides that, the first one was a better film, no doubt about that in many ways but because Joker 1 was excellent, the expectations for the second part were surely pretty high, and I think for that reason alone, you will have some disappointment about certain things in the movie that in your head you would have done differently to make it more interesting. Sometimes it was a bit too much political, too much rules but I can understand that direction because of the plot. It may had been better again if it was less intense in that regard but I think they have also done a great job because it was a psychological drama in a sense so it was needed for sure.It had some pretty intense scenes. Some of them made my heart pound like crazy, creating a rollercoaster of emotions just like the other movie. I cried also, don\\'t really know why but at the beginning, I found myself too deep in the story, feeling like Arthur (Joaquin) deserved to be treated better than that. I found the instant connection he had with Lee so touching, and it made me smile and feel really comforted as well just like a feeling of warm in the winter.This was an intense film that makes you think about your relationships in life and how you treat people around you, specially people that are different from the \"normality\". You definitely feel the buzz a bit after you exit the cinema, and it makes you rethink the whole movie. It opens discussions with other cinephiles about your experience when watching the movie, and I think it is really well done for that reason too. I\\'d give it a 7 out of 10. Love it or hate it, the purpose of cinema and the essence of art that they capture is on point, you cannot deny it. That\\'s life...Viewed on October 8, 2024.',\n",

So much potential lost.Gaga was good.. not what was needed for this version of joker in my opinion. In fact the musical element just got annoying as the film progressed.

       "    'Review': \"Let me start by saying I wasn't all that impressed with Phillips' original Joker movie. It wasn't a bad movie, but it seemed quite simply like Taxi Driver and The Killing Joke smashed together. Not wholly original, and I came away wondering whether the Joker character really needs a backstory or justification for existing. I mean, isn't the lack of a backstory what made Heath Ledger's portrayal in the Dark Knight so appealing? The enigmatic agent of chaos who just wanted to watch the world burn - for no apparent reason? Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal, while skilfully done, was clearly not that Joker, nor was he meant to be.Yet somehow, it's as if the audience of Joker: Folie à Deux didn't get the memo on that. It seems like many original Joker fans, somewhat bewilderingly, expected this movie to be his glorious transformation into the criminal mastermind who would go on to be Batman's arch nemesis. If you haven't yet seen the sequel, and that's what you expect, you will be disappointed. But ask yourself - would that even make sense? At what point in the original did you believe Joaquin Phoenix's Joker to be a criminal mastermind, who could competently stay several steps ahead of a well-educated billionaire vigilante who's described as 'the world's greatest detective'?This movie is fine. It's not brilliant, and it's not awful. The musical numbers go on quite a bit and don't really add anything meaningful to the story. But I think it's a real shame for people to totally misunderstand the Joker character being set up in the first movie, and then hate on the sequel for not making him an inconsistent mess. When you read other reviews claiming there is no character development - what they mean is they didn't get the character development they wanted. Owning up to ones crimes and reconnecting with ones humanity IS character development. Realising that a need for love and connection in a brutally uncaring world has driven you to pretend to be someone you're not and led to even more division, destruction and brutality IS character development.People will probably hate this review for pointing that out, and that's fine. Everyone's entitled to an opinion. But at least be honest about your reasons for having those opinions.\",\n",

The first film was a fantastic exploration of Arthur Fleck's descent into insanity and violence. So what to do with the second...?The choice to make it a musical was bold. It captures Fleck's need for escape, and the twisted romanticism of his relationship with Harley.Unfortunately, the strategy falls flat at times, with the musical sequences dragging on and the plot being very thin. Phoenix is once again amazing as Fleck, showing the full range of his talent. Brendan Gleeson plays the cruel Irish prison guard like it is second nature and Lady Gaga is fine as Harley (but not outstanding - Margot Robbie has nothing to worry about).I would give this film 6/10, except for the ending, which is (in my opinion) brilliant, thus earning the film an additional point. I cannot say more about the ending without spoilers, other than it fixes one of the issues that I had with the original Joker film.\",\n",

One thing for sure the acting is once again faultless, whether he (Pheonix) wins again is a matter of opnion. Lady Gaga is solid as Harley and gave her a more sultry demeanour, then her predecessor.There are times again like the first you are almost cheering the anti hero and that's a testament to Pheonix and his performance. Script and storytelling wise it does fall flat as it really doesn't move forward. Set soley pretty much in the prison and courtroom it seems its rehashing the inner demons of Arthur which we already are aware of.Also Folie A Duex is almost lost in its meaning as it seems only an after thought.

       "    'Review': 'To start off, I\\'ll say that I absolutely loved the original Joker (2019), like most of the other reviewers have stated. This film is something different entirely from the previous entry, which was specified early on when it was first announced. With it being revealed as a \"musical\", fans of the first film were immediately turned off, which is understandable - at first glance. It may be hard to head into this knowing the prior information as it may be discouraging, however, the film pulls it off in more ways than one.This is Todd Phillip\\'s interpretation of the character of The Joker. As a director, he does have the right to interpret the character in any way he chooses. I fully supported the way he explored the character in the first film. I still support his choices here, because in reality, the sequel has more of the same themes and elements of the original. The film is bold in a lot of ways, changing the style here and there to focus on a new aspect of Arthur Fleck\\'s mental illness, being music, and expressing himself in that new way. Of course the musical aspects are not for everyone, and it\\'s going to turn a lot of people away, but it\\'s important to give it a chance as I did. Did people just forget that in the first entry Arthur danced, sang, and even listened to old songs to get in the mood to be Joker? The themes are just stronger in this film.Joker (2019) is my favorite film ever made, so seeing the reviews pour in so negatively for the sequel of course had me worried. After seeing it for myself, I can confidently say that people are severely overreacting. Whether it\\'s fans of the original, Batman comic book fans, or just people who hate musicals. I\\'m not a huge musical fan myself either, and it was a bit difficult to adjust to this after the first song began, but with time it did weave into the story perfectly. Arthur and Harley bounce off of each other so perfectly, and they feel like a real dysfunctional couple. They share the screen in such a unique way that it fits so well into the universe that Todd Phillips created.As for the acting, Joaquin Phoenix is again fantastic, Lady Gaga isn\\'t as terrible as people say she is either, and everyone else in the film pulls together to make it one cohesive story. There are still emotional gut punches, there are shocking reveals, and there are even funny moments too. This is completely different from the original, but it is also very similar in a lot of thematic ways. The cinematography is outstanding like the first film, the sets are amazing like the first film, and the story is pretty good all things considered.So, the bottom line, is it perfect? Not even close. Is it worth watching? Of course. It\\'s not that bad, and that\\'s coming from a die hard fan of the original. It\\'s experimental, it tries a lot of new things, it succeeds for the majority of the time, and fails few and far between. As for the whole ending debacle, I thought it was a fine ending. It was shocking of course, as I\\'m sure that was the intention, but it was a fine ending to the story. Give it a chance, maybe rewatch it again if you have to. Look at it with an open mind, like we all did with the first film. 7/10.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Having watched Joker: Folie A Deux, the critique makes so much sense, but so does all the praise. While I totally get the outrage and disappointment of the audience with this one, this much anticipated sequel of the award-winning 2019 banger is by no means a trash or a waste, not even close, and I\\'ll tell you why Joker 2 is not as bad as people say!It is not Todd Philips\\' failure, but sheer bravery to chalk out this movie like he did, when it could have been so different and so much more, in so many ways. I mean no one would remotely think of filming a psychotic drama as a musical, given the amount of constraints one would face in execution, but Todd did; and mind you, he not just did it, he outsmarted me, pulling me in for something I was not ready for.Joaquin, capitalizing on a commendable support from Gaga, blew it out of the park as he makes it increasingly difficult for me to take my eyes off him at many points! He continues to do full justice to the fractured soul of Arthur Fleck who still struggles to find and justify his true identity amidst the chaos of the past and the present. Gaga was a delight to watch as well!So what accounts for the mass disappointment?This is one hell of a difficult movie to absorb along with its cinematic intricacies. NOT EVERYBODY WILL LIKE IT. If you CANNOT catch and appreciate the subtle nuances that Todd and Joaquin navigate through the entirety of the movie\\'s duration, you WILL NOT appreciate the beauty of the movie.I feel that a good majority of Indian audience and \"moviegoers\" is just not ready for Joker 2.Oh and talking of beauty, some shots of the movie are such treats to the eyes owing to a masterful cinematography.While the loaded and very frequent songs, music, and dance might annoy you (and remind you of a typical bollywood low-grade romance drama), it is well-executed for two reasons - first, the songs! The music (including the background score) is wonderful. Second, the music-movie-integration! If you pay attention to all songs played throughout, you will see how they couple magically to the elements of the movie, and to fragments of Arthur\\'s soul, as they depict the characters\\' voice, both figuratively and literally. However, there is no denying that the loaded musical element kind of takes away the spark that this movie \"could have\" ignited otherwise.Joker and Joker 2 take two very different paths to approach the same goal - The Character of Joker, and it is this difference that needs to be acknowledged, and respected. While the prequel prepared the audience for a banger with its gritty, dark and psychotic approach, the sequel seeks to bring home the central study of character, delved only more deeply this time, via a musical (again, that\\'s brave!), but that doesn\\'t mean we have to hate it. While the benchmark set by the first movie was just too damn high, the sequel has its own subtleties that MUST be appreciated. Again, its not just a musical that happens to be a sequel (or vice-versa), but its a good musical sequel.So why did I call it Joker 1.5?That\\'s because a sequel is something you need but this, I feel, is not a movie we necessarily needed. It is more of an offshoot that picks up right after the events of the first movie and then builds upon it. However, even though we didn\\'t need it, I am glad they made it; that\\'s exactly why its not a waste. If anything, it only navigates the character of Joker more profoundly and gives us deeper insights into how Arthur percieves himself. As the movie progressed, I found myself INSIDE Arthur\\'s struggle of finding himself and not just being a spectator; that\\'s exactly where the movie succeeded, that\\'s exactly where Joaquin succeeded (what an astonishing actor!) - in involving and capturing the audience in his own chaos.Its Joker 1.5 because while the Joker (the idea of it) is now out there in the world (with a profound influence on the masses), Arthur still finds himself very much confined and fractured within himself.And so the movie artfully brings out (yet again) the central idea that the Joker is not one man, its a concept, an idea! Arthur Fleck emerges as merely a conduit in whom that idea was born - all of that garnished with exceptional performance, great music, and a spectacular cinematography.What didn\\'t work out was the unfulfillment of people\\'s high expectations from the villain of Gotham, and obviously some structural and executional defects here and there in the movie; so much could have been so much better in so many ways. While the first half is still something you feel captivated by, the second half gradually makes you vulnerable to the idea of hating the movie.Therefore, it is only with a patient acknowledgement of cinematic nuances of Joker 2 that you will appreciate this well-made sequel which struggles a lot to live up to its prequel, and could have been far better, but it isn\\'t.',\n",

It brings to life what someone like the Joker would actually be experiencing and gives an honest voice to mental illness.

       "    'Review': 'The acting by Phoenix and Gaga is top tier. Whilst people currently dislike it due to it having an alternate musical genre people will realise the masterpiece that has been created using an alternate genre not following the same niche that has been the meta for the previous decade. The songs are perfectly spaced adding an enjoyable element to continue to register the audiences engagement throughout the film. Furthermore the movie offers and amazing deep dive into insanity and a split personality whilst offering an in depth and entertaining court room scene that offers the perfect mix of drama, comedy and suspense.',\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': 'Great poetic drama. Not easy for mass audiences.',\n",
       "    'Review': \"The movie brings novelty, not relying on the formula of the previous. It's a story about suffering, a true drama about how cruel real life is. To make it softer, the musical format and a poetic narrative are adopted. It is a great work of art, but mass audiences expecting fun, excitement, or some repetition of the original formula will get very disappointed. What more real than a cruel world, full of obstacles, full of twists, with an unpredictable plot, and where what matters are not individuals, but the image they project? Still, the movie is more superficial than the previous, or at least more subtle on its depth, leaving for reflective audiences to get the deeper meanings.\",\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': \"Joker: Folie à Deux isn't quite as good as the first film, but it stands on its own as a unique, compelling piece of cinema.\",\n",
       "    'Review': 'I attended an advanced screening of Joker: Folie à Deux (2024) this evening. The storyline follows Arthur Fleck after the events of the first film, framed as a sort of prison drama. He is set to be reevaluated for his crimes and must return to court. In order to defend himself, he must convince the world that there are two versions of him: Arthur Fleck and The Joker. As he prepares for his trial, he meets a woman who changes his life forever-but will she help his case, or send him spiraling in an entirely new direction?Directed by Todd Phillips (The Hangover), the film stars Joaquin Phoenix (Walk the Line), Lady Gaga (A Star is Born), Catherine Keener (Capote), Brendan Gleeson (28 Days Later), Steve Coogan (The Other Guys),!and Harry Lawtey (The Pale Blue Eye).I could watch a million of these Joker movies. Joaquin Phoenix is a national treasure, once again delivering an iconic performance of a man battling his inner demons-except now, love is the new demon in his life. His seamless transformation from The Joker to Arthur Fleck and back is a masterclass in acting. The entire cast delivers tremendous performances, and every scene Phoenix shares with Lady Gaga and Brendan Gleeson is masterfully crafted. Their dialogue, mannerisms, and chemistry are pitch-perfect for the story.The filmmaking here is top-notch, with stunning cinematography, lighting, and camera work. While some of the musical numbers were hit or miss, certain songs were perfect for fans who understand the Joker\\'s inner turmoil. One song in particular, \"The Joker Is Me,\" is an absolute standout-a 10/10 moment that resonates deeply with the audience. There\\'s also a courtroom scene featuring \"Mr. Puddles\" that\\'s cinematic gold. The writing is sharp, with lines like \"no more singing\" serving as a clever relationship metaphor. The ending is completely unexpected, making the film even more enjoyable.In conclusion, Joker: Folie à Deux isn\\'t quite as good as the first film, but it stands on its own as a unique, compelling piece of cinema. I\\'d score it an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"The Joker 2 is simply a better film than the first one in my opinion.The original was well made but to me felt very derivative.It didn't capture me like it did many others.But this sequel was brilliant.This is how the story had to end if it was set apart from the usual batman storyline.This is about Arthur Fleck not Bruce Wayne.And it was great to see a very nasty person get the ending he definitely deserved.The Joker ridiculously became a hero to a lot of misguided people after the first film and it was sad to see his image alongside rather ridiculous quotes on some Facebook pages.The use of songs was genius and Lady Ga Ga was pitch perfect is song and in her acting.Showing that she was also a maniac who wanted to use Joker as a conduit for her unfulfilled psychopathic desires.Harley Quin is a pathetic and nasty character here. No humour, one liners or comic violence in this version of her.Just a liar and user.This is a rare case of the sequel being much better than the last film.If you want to see Joker v Batman watch the Dark Knight. It was definitively done there.The Joker 2 is it's own thing.\",\n",
