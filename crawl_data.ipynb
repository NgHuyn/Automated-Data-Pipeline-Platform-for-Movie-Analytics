       "    'Review': 'I\\'m so irritated. \"Joker\" was a gritty, intense psychological thriller that explored complex themes of mental illness and societal breakdown. It was a raw, dark film that didn\\'t need gimmicks or unnecessary changes to make a statement. So WHY in the world would anyone think it\\'s a good idea to turn \"Joker 2\" into a musical?This is a slap in the face to fans of the original. We didn\\'t ask for dancing and singing - we wanted more of the same unsettling atmosphere, not a Broadway-style number in the middle of Gotham\\'s madness. I signed up for a continuation of Arthur Fleck\\'s descent into chaos, not a flashy musical break that completely destroys the tone.The first \"Joker\" was a masterpiece. This sequel choice feels like a desperate attempt to be \"different\" without respecting the core of what made the character and story so compelling. Ridiculous decision.',\n",

It lost the entire spirit and message of the first one.The first hour was next to pointless and felt like a long, strung out, snoozefest. The second half had a spark of something acceptable, but that dumpster quickly caught fire again and led to one of the worst endings imaginable. Cutting the awful music would\\'ve saved 45 minutes of movie.If the goal was to make a bad movie, it would win film of the year and I swear I gave it to the last frame to be good, but it just fell flat on its face. I\\'m going to pretend it was never made, and that I didn\\'t waste two hours of my life on this. If you actually want to watch this, wait until it\\'s free.If I were to say one thing positive, it did have ONE good song and sequence to accompany it, \"Every Deck Has a Joker, and That Joker Is Me\".Moral of the story is, I\\'m never going to watch this again.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux was a huge disappointment. The movie failed to capture the essence of the Joker character, feeling more like a hollow follow-up than a meaningful sequel. Harley Quinn's introduction brought no impact or depth, and her presence felt unnecessary rather than complementary. The story lacked the intensity and psychological complexity that made the first Joker film so compelling. Honestly, it didn't feel like a Joker film at all !!! It should have been titled something else because it didn't represent what fans expect from the Joker universe... I'm sure lots of people will leave the movie from the half because the story is not moving forward at all !!\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'It seems as if the audience is being punished for enjoying, celebrating and supporting JOKER 2019. This sequel was a disrespectful and malicious take on the Joker. The movie was mainly divided into three parts being prison, courtroom and musical all of which robs the Joker of any personal agency. At no point did we get a display of the criminal mastermind, psychopath with a warped, sadistic sense of humor that are staple characteristics of a the villain we have come to know and love. Furthermore, there is an added frustration because the level of financial investment, production and quality acting is evident. If you have any affinity with previous versions of the Joker this movie will annoy and aggravate you. I recommend that you save your time and money.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker Folie a Deux... Or just Joker 2 for normal people, is a completely unneeded sequel, that got made by Todd Phillips.He decided to shred and spit on his original, praised movie, to cut himself away from the \"toxicity of Joker\".Joker in this movie goes back to miserable Arthur Fleck, who is emasculated, ridiculed and humiliated for most of the movie. He has no agency in his movie, he is just there as the events take place around him, and when he finally gets his moment it just ends with one of the dumbest decisions he could\\'ve made.The ending is the ultimate end to Joker franchise by Todd Phillips, like he wanted to make a statement about his first movie and to be perfectly sure nobody in WB will ever ask him to make another one.Movie is a boring slog, with no story, no character development, musical scenes being just there out of nowhere - just because we have Lady Gaga on screen, who is a good actress by the way, but almost everything involving Gaga is a musical, and she gets no way to actually act.Todd Phillips already showed us that he is bad at sequels with The Hangover movies - but still there was some enjoyment to be had with 2 and 3... and especially with 2.This is an insult to the fans, to the Joker and to the cast who tried their best with the crappy material they were given.

It's a crushing letdown, and honestly, it's even more underwhelming than Coppola's Megalopolis this year. I was hyped for this film, but it failed to deliver on nearly every level. Warner Bros. Needs to take a hard look at their creative control over their hit movies, because this sequel is a straight-up embarrassment. It's like they took everything that made the original great and threw it out the window.I'm genuinely sad to see a beloved character and story fall so far from its former glory. This franchise deserved better, and the fans deserved more. The plot was a mess, the characters were paper-thin, and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. I'm still wondering how a film with so much potential could go so wrong. I hope the studio takes this as a wake-up call and goes back to the drawing board to figure out what made the original film so great in the first place.Right now, I'm just left feeling disappointed and frustrated. This sequel was a waste of potential, and it's a reminder that sometimes, it's better to leave well enough alone rather than trying to revive something that's best left in the past.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"The original Joker was a dark, gritty exploration of mental illness and societal decay. It was a critical and commercial success, leaving audiences stunned and disturbed. However, its sequel, Joker: Folie à Deux, is a disappointing departure from the original's success. The decision to turn the film into a musical was a baffling one that completely undermines the tone and themes established in the first film.The musical numbers in Joker: Folie à Deux feel forced and out of place. They disrupt the narrative and detract from the film's overall atmosphere. The songs are often generic and forgettable, failing to add anything meaningful to the story. Additionally, the musical style clashes with the film's dark subject matter, creating a jarring dissonance that is difficult to ignore.Beyond the musical elements, Joker: Folie à Deux suffers from a lack of compelling storytelling. The plot is predictable and the characters are underdeveloped. The film fails to capture the same intensity and emotional depth as its predecessor. The pacing is slow and the dialogue is often clunky and contrived.The ending of the film is particularly disappointing. It feels rushed and unsatisfying, leaving many questions unanswered. The conclusion is a far cry from the shocking and thought-provoking ending of the original film. It is a letdown that leaves the viewer feeling cheated and unsatisfied.In conclusion, Joker: Folie à Deux is a significant disappointment. The decision to turn the film into a musical was a major miscalculation that undermines the film's tone and themes. The storytelling is weak, the characters are underdeveloped, and the ending is unsatisfying. Fans of the original film will likely be left feeling disappointed and confused by this misguided sequel.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"It's incredibly disappointing to say, but Joker 2 fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. After the phenomenal success of Joker (2019), I, like many fans, was eagerly anticipating the sequel. The first film was groundbreaking in its portrayal of mental health, societal unrest, and the psychological descent of Arthur Fleck, brought to life masterfully by Joaquin Phoenix. It was a powerful and darkly emotional story with a stunning narrative arc and visuals that lingered in the mind long after the credits rolled. Naturally, I had high expectations for Joker 2, but unfortunately, the film fell flat in nearly every aspect.To start, the plot is almost non-existent. Unlike the first movie, which had a compelling story that kept you hooked from start to finish, Joker 2 feels aimless. There's no sense of direction, and the events that unfold seem arbitrary, almost like they're there just to fill time. The narrative doesn't build up to anything meaningful or significant, and there's a lack of the emotional depth that made the original such a standout. Instead of focusing on a coherent storyline, it seems the filmmakers opted for style over substance, and that really diminishes the experience.One of the biggest issues with Joker 2 is how predictable it is. The first movie was filled with shocking twists and moments that genuinely took you by surprise, but this sequel fails to deliver on that front. You can almost see every scene coming from a mile away, and by the halfway point, the film becomes boring because you know exactly where it's heading. There's no suspense, no tension, and nothing to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. It's frustrating to sit through a movie where every plot point is telegraphed long before it happens, and that's exactly what Joker 2 does.Character development is another area where Joker 2 falls short. In the original, we witnessed Arthur Fleck's transformation into the Joker in a slow, methodical way that felt earned and organic. In this film, however, the characters seem stagnant. There's no growth or evolution, and they don't go through any significant challenges or changes that would make them interesting. Even Joaquin Phoenix's performance, which was the highlight of the first film, feels subdued and lacking in intensity this time around. It's almost as if the actor is going through the motions without the passion and commitment he had previously shown.The pacing of the film is also a major issue. It drags on, with long stretches where nothing of significance happens. Scenes feel drawn out for no reason, and the film never really builds any momentum. By the time you reach the climax, you're left feeling underwhelmed because the movie never really earns its big moments. It's difficult to stay engaged when the film keeps losing steam every few minutes, and that's something Joker 2 never manages to overcome.Overall, Joker 2 is a huge disappointment. It lacks the heart, soul, and depth of its predecessor, and instead of building on the success of the first film, it feels like a watered-down version with none of the originality or impact. The story is weak, the characters are underdeveloped, and the film is plagued by predictability and poor pacing. If you were excited about this sequel, I'd suggest tempering your expectations because, unfortunately, it falls far short of what made the first movie so special. In the end, Joker 2 is a letdown, and not worth the time or money to see in theaters.\",\n",

I'm not averse to musicals in general, only when the singing is terrible, and Joaquin Phoenix couldn't carry a tune in a basket - Gaga can only do so much, and even she is given little opportunity to shine, only occasionally belting out the tunes like we know she can.Add the fact that the plot is stupefyingly dull - part dreary prison story, part boring courtroom drama - and what you have is the sequel that no-one wanted. The themes are the same as the first film - madness, mental illness, societal collapse etc. - but the execution is so left-field as to alienate the established fan base. It's an undeniably gutsy move to make something so completely different, but there's something to be said for the old adage 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' - especially when your leading man is so musically challenged.1/10 - quite possibly the worst film of the year.N.

       "    'Review': 'If you watched the first 20 minutes of the movie, left for an hour, and then returned asking what you missed, your friend would likely say, \"Nothing.\" I\\'m not particularly fond of the first part, but at least it had something worth watching or a story to tell.However, this work is a disaster no one could have imagined. Literally nothing happens, and even the songs and performances feel incredibly dull and out of place. The acting might be relatively good, but without a script, without events, and without a true film.The shock lies in how the filmmakers convinced themselves that what they were making was a movie. The entire hall was filled with boredom, despite it being a special screening of the film. Everyone felt bored, and half the audience even fell asleep. And when we finally reached the climax and everyone was expecting something to happen... nothing did. If you asked someone to come up with the worst possible ending for this film, it still wouldn\\'t compare to the sheer absurdity of the actual ending.This film might become one of the worst in the last five years, not just because of its poor quality, but because of the downfall from a record-breaking film that was agreed upon by both critics and audiences, to a repulsive movie that\\'s hard to finish watching.',\n",

Yes, half of a Joker movie is a musical. Second, it seems like something went off the tracks during production. Either the director got mad, Lady Gaga got mad, or the studio got mad. Nothing makes sense. Nothing gets resolved. The script is all over the place. Third, this movie adds nothing to the original Joker. It is as if everyone wanted to see how to absolutely ruin this Joker franchise and did so with flying colors. Fourth, what was the point of this movie? More questions. Zero answers. The story is just confusing, boring, and put people to sleep at my showing. Fifth, the ending pushed this to a 1 for me. I had it at around a 5/10 until the last 10 minutes. Only see this movie if you got extra money to waste and want to be disappointed beyond your wildest dreams.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Seriously, who thought a musical sequel was a good idea? They ruined a perfect movie with stupid singing and dancing. It's like they forgot what made the first one great. This is a joke, not a movie.The original Joker was a dark, gritty masterpiece that explored the depths of mental illness and societal decay. The sequel, however, is a complete departure from that tone. The introduction of musical numbers feels forced and out of place, disrupting the film's narrative and destroying the atmosphere that made the first movie so compelling.The idea of turning a serious drama into a musical is a risky one that ultimately doesn't pay off. Musical films require strong songs and a well-crafted narrative to be successful. Joker 2 fails on both counts. The songs are forgettable, and the plot is weak.The performances in Joker 2 are also a mixed bag. While Joaquin Phoenix delivers a solid performance, the rest of the cast feels underwhelming. The supporting characters are one-dimensional and fail to make a lasting impression.In conclusion, Joker 2 is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. The introduction of musical elements is a significant misstep that undermines the film's narrative and tone. While the original Joker was a masterpiece, Joker 2 is a forgettable mess.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Let's cut to the chase: Joker 2 is an unholy mess-a dumpster fire wrapped in a pretentious bow. It's as if the creators decided to throw out everything that made the first film a haunting exploration of mental illness and replace it with a hollow, cliché-laden spectacle that panders to the lowest common denominator.Remember how Joker held a mirror to the darker corners of society? Well, this sequel is just a funhouse mirror, reflecting distorted caricatures of its characters while simultaneously obliterating their depth. Arthur Fleck's descent into madness was a visceral journey; here, it's just a lazy stroll through a comic book cliché.And let's talk about Harley Quinn. What happened to the brutal, chaotic love story that rocked the very foundations of their twisted relationship? Instead, we get a half-baked romance that feels more like a marketing ploy than a genuine connection. Arthur and Harley's dynamic is now as shallow as a kiddie pool, stripped of the raw emotion that made their narrative compelling.The climax? A nonsensical mess, featuring a random character who exists solely to meet a bloody end-because apparently, shocking violence is the last refuge of a lazy script. There's no coherent story arc, just a series of aimless scenes that fail to capture the essence of the original. It's as if the filmmakers threw darts at a board of plot devices and hoped for the best.The musical numbers? An auditory assault that adds nothing but further emptiness to an already vacuous experience. It's almost impressive how they managed to achieve zero emotional resonance in a film filled with song and dance.In conclusion, Joker 2 is a painful watch, a cautionary tale of what happens when studios prioritize spectacle over substance. Here's hoping the creators take a long, hard look at their choices-or, better yet, just step away from the industry entirely.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I'm really disappointed with this new direction for the 2024 Joker film. The original 'Joker' was a raw, dark exploration of mental illness and society's failings, with a tone that was unsettling and deeply impactful. It didn't rely on cheap tricks to make a point; it was grounded and gritty, which made Arthur Fleck's descent into madness feel real and haunting.So why turn the sequel into a musical? This feels like a complete disconnect from what made the first movie so powerful. Instead of continuing with the same intense atmosphere, we're bombarded with music at every turn, even in moments that should have been suspenseful or emotionally heavy. It almost feels like the filmmakers were more interested in crafting a musical experience than telling a compelling story.The constant musical interruptions destroy the tone of Gotham's chaotic underworld. It's frustrating because it feels like a decision to stand out rather than honor what made the original so memorable. A flashy musical? That's not what Joker fans signed up for. We wanted to see Arthur Fleck's journey continue, not break into song. If you don't have Spotify Premium, you can watch this movie.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"As a huge fan of the first *Joker*, I went into *Joker 2* with high expectations. The original movie was dark, intense, and told a powerful story about Arthur Fleck's descent into madness. It was gritty and had a raw energy that made it stand out from other comic book adaptations. But sadly, *Joker 2* completely misses the mark, and to be honest, it's a massive letdown.The biggest problem with *Joker 2* is that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. The original film was very focused on its message and its tone, but this sequel is all over the place. It lacks any clear direction, and I found myself constantly wondering where the movie was going. Instead of being a tight, gripping story like the first one, it feels scattered and confused.What makes things worse is the decision to turn *Joker 2* into a musical. When I first heard that this film would include musical numbers, I was worried. It's such a strange choice for a character like the Joker, and unfortunately, my fears were confirmed. The musical element doesn't fit at all with the tone of the movie. Every time the story starts to build up some tension or emotion, it gets interrupted by a random song or dance sequence. These scenes are supposed to add something unique, but instead, they end up making the movie feel silly and unfocused.It's frustrating because there are moments in *Joker 2* where you can see glimpses of what made the first movie so great. The darker, more dramatic scenes still have potential, but they're constantly undercut by these nonsensical musical numbers. It's like the film can't decide if it wants to be a serious psychological drama or a flashy musical, and as a result, it fails at both. The musical scenes turn what could have been intense moments into awkward, boring parts of the movie.Joaquin Phoenix, who was brilliant in the first movie, feels wasted here. You can tell he's still giving it his all in certain scenes, trying to bring that same depth and intensity to Arthur Fleck's character, but the film doesn't give him the room to fully explore it. Instead, he's forced into these strange, out-of-place musical sequences that take away from his performance. It's a real shame because we know Phoenix is capable of so much more, but the movie doesn't let him shine the way it did in the original.Another issue is the pacing. *Joker 2* feels both rushed and dragged out at the same time. There are parts of the movie that feel like they're rushing through important plot points without giving them the time they need to develop, and other parts that drag on forever with no real purpose. The result is a movie that feels uneven and disjointed, and it's hard to stay engaged when the story is so all over the place.What made the first *Joker* so impactful was its slow, deliberate build-up and its focus on Arthur's character development. You could feel his descent into madness, and it was hard not to get pulled into his world. *Joker 2* lacks that same emotional punch. It's missing the subtlety and the tension that made the original so powerful, and instead, it feels like a chaotic mess.There are a few redeeming qualities in the film. The cinematography is still visually striking, and there are some moments where the film manages to capture that gritty, realistic atmosphere from the first movie. The supporting cast, including Lady Gaga, delivers solid performances, but even they can't save the movie from its own confusion.In the end, *Joker 2* just doesn't live up to the first film. It's a disappointing sequel that doesn't seem to understand what made the original so great. The musical element, in particular, feels like a huge mistake, and it turns what could have been an interesting follow-up into a confusing and boring experience. Fans of the first movie will likely walk away feeling let down, wondering how a sequel could go so wrong.\",\n",

Despite Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga's involvement, their performances fall flat in a confusing narrative with erratic tonal shifts. The result is a cringeworthy sequel that fails to live up to the original's intensity. The film's attempt to blend psychological drama with romance feels forced and awkward, adding to the overall confusion. Ultimately, what could have been a gripping sequel collapses under its own disorganization. Save yourself the disappointment and skip this one. Despite the hype, Joker fails to deliver anything memorable, leaving audiences frustrated rather than entertained.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"The first Joker is in my top 10 movies of all time. But this movie was a complete disappointment. Surprisingly the musical elements worked. They really did. Ignore all the review bombs about it being a musical. Because that is not the problem here. They were one of the best parts of the movie. It was enjoyable up until around the last 20 minutes. Had me thinking I was going to love this one too. But then they take the most drastic character change possible and completely destroy the character. It's like the director set out to piss in the mouth of the fans of the first movie and fans of the Joker character. There's no other way this could have been thought of. It really seems like they set out to ruin it for the fans. If you are not a fan of the first you will probably like this. This movie completely ruins everything the first did. So please, if you are a fan of the first don't ruin it for yourself by watching this :(\",\n",

The waiting time for something exciting to happen was unbearable, and the pacing made the entire film boring. I found myself on the verge of sleeping through the middle, as it failed to hold any real tension or intrigue. Many parts of the plot felt like non-sensical twists, trying too hard to be profound, but coming off as confusing and empty. Overall, it was a horrible viewing experience, lacking the brilliance of the original. I really really hate the fact I didnt left the room earlier.',\n",

In this, the second film, it's as if Arthur/joker is just being punished over and over again, to the point where the joker no longer exists and Arthur is more broken than before. Is this some kind of message to the downtrodden? Know your place, go with the narrative, do as you're told or else?I really don't understand why they chose to go in such a direction with this film.\",\n",

Sequel's are already hard to pull off with these movies, but it feels very little thought was put into the making of this movie. The ending was pointless it felt like a whole two hours focused on a court room and music. They could have thrown in some childhood throwbacks or something worth while!\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Imagine you love a certain brand of chocolate, you genuinely think it\\'s the best chocolate in the market. You wish for years the creators came up with an evolution of the chocolate, a slight variation just for fun sake\\'s. The company finally announces a new product, marketing it in the same way with the same name but just a different subtitle (Say Snickers \"Almonds\" or Snickers \"Peanut butter\" or whatever). You excitedly go to buy the product, open up the wrapper and take a first bite. You feel your face start to melt when your brain understands you\\'re not even eating a chocolate, it\\'s some sort of terrible protein bar with mint flavor and a little line of chocolate fudge on top. That is exactly how I felt about this movie.I don\\'t care who is to blame here. If Todd Philips as a director for putting out this terrible scam, or execs for forcing him to do it. Either way, the bottom line is that it is ethically wrong to take a movie that developed such a strong identity, force it to be something entirely different, and then let a massive fanbase flock to theaters to experience this heartbreaking surprise. As a fan of a the first movie, I went right back to theaters for the second one, logically expecting to see a second part of the first movie. Not a movie about lady gaga with joker as a secondary character.Cannot think of a worse scenario.',\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': 'Really bad musical',\n",
       "    'Review': 'Joker: Folie à Deux promised to be a daring, artistic exploration of the Joker and Harley Quinn\\'s twisted dynamic. Instead, it serves up a baffling misstep: a musical. Yes, you read that right-a musical that somehow manages to gut the intensity and nihilism that made the original Joker such a cultural phenomenon. And not just a musical, but a disappointing one, where the songs are as forgettable as a dropped cup of coffee on a rainy day in Gotham.First off, the music. Remember when we thought Joker was about gritty realism, descending madness, and psychological torment? Well, Folie à Deux throws that out the window in favor of ...show tunes? The songs come across as half-baked, neither catchy nor deep, with no lasting resonance. You won\\'t leave the cinema humming the tunes because, frankly, there\\'s nothing to hum. It\\'s almost like the filmmakers thought, \"Hey, what if we took all the tension and grim beauty of the original and drowned it in unremarkable piano chords and lyrics that sound like they were penned in a day?\" The result is a soundtrack that feels as relevant to Joker\\'s original film noir aesthetic as a karaoke night in Arkham Asylum.The original Joker was a gripping exploration of mental illness, social decay, and the creation of a monster-a character study with noir influences, dark alleyways, and eerie lighting that matched its protagonist\\'s crumbling psyche. It thrived in its starkness, its minimalism, and its refusal to hold your hand or sing to you about what you\\'re meant to feel. But in Folie à Deux, we get elaborate musical numbers that feel misplaced, unnecessary, and at odds with the bleakness that worked so well before. It\\'s almost like someone saw La La Land and thought, \"You know what this gritty psycho-drama needs? Jazz hands!\" Because that\\'ll totally fit, right?The songs themselves do nothing to advance the story, nor do they provide insight into the characters. This isn\\'t Les Misérables where the musical format elevates the narrative to emotional heights. No, here the musical numbers act as speed bumps, derailing any chance at building tension or atmosphere. Just when you think you\\'re about to dive back into the intense psychological drama that made the first film so compelling, bam! Here comes an awkward duet that screams \"filler\" rather than \"emotional depth.\"And let\\'s talk about the character of Harley Quinn. Sure, she\\'s always been quirky, but the way her character is introduced and utilized in Folie à Deux feels like a watered-down Broadway version of the chaotic, unpredictable force of nature she\\'s supposed to be. Instead of pushing the Joker deeper into madness, she dances along in a subplot that seems only half-interested in the descent into insanity that Joker should be. Lady Gaga\\'s performance is fine, but it\\'s hard to tell if it\\'s the casting or the musical numbers themselves that make her feel like she belongs in a different movie altogether.If you went into Joker expecting the tragic elegance of noir, the dissonance of Folie à Deux will hit you like a clown car driving through a funeral procession. The dark cinematography, the brooding score from the first film, all replaced with flashy, glitzy numbers that don\\'t know what they\\'re doing in this story. There\\'s no thematic continuity.',\n",

       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie À Deux\" is an exhausting misstep that betrays the bold spirit of its predecessor. Where the first \"Joker\" was an incisive psychological thriller, this sequel is an overstuffed, self-indulgent mess, trading subtlety for spectacle and losing sight of what made the original so compelling. The film stumbles under the weight of its own pretensions, trying desperately to be provocative but only succeeding in being hollow.The decision to make this a musical feels more like a gimmick than a thoughtful creative choice. The music sequences are jarring, out of place, and do nothing to further the narrative. Instead of enhancing the emotional landscape, they disrupt it, turning moments of potential tension into unintentionally laughable scenes. It\\'s as if the filmmakers are screaming for attention, hoping to distract the audience from the film\\'s lack of substance with over-the-top set pieces and dizzying visuals.Joaquin Phoenix, who gave a haunting, layered performance in the original, seems to be on autopilot here. His portrayal of Arthur Fleck feels more like a parody than a continuation of the character\\'s descent into madness. The film\\'s attempts to explore his psyche again are shallow, rehashing the same themes without offering any new insights. The character\\'s arc stagnates, and by the end, we\\'re left wondering if there was any real purpose to his journey this time around.Lady Gaga\\'s Harley Quinn feels equally misused. Her talent is undeniable, but the script gives her little to work with. Her character comes off as a caricature, lacking the complexity or tragic depth needed to balance Arthur\\'s madness. Instead, the film leans too heavily on their chemistry, hoping it will be enough to carry the story, but it never really gels.Visually, the film is as chaotic as its narrative. Todd Phillips seems more interested in crafting striking imagery than in telling a coherent story. The cinematography, while impressive in its ambition, often feels like style over substance. The film\\'s color palette and set design, though aesthetically bold, can\\'t hide the emptiness at its core.In trying to be a provocative commentary on society\\'s ills, \"Folie À Deux\" feels more like a desperate plea for attention, a shallow imitation of the first film\\'s more profound moments. It\\'s a sequel that misunderstands its own success, turning what was once a powerful character study into an incoherent spectacle. Rather than leaving the theater feeling unsettled or reflective, audiences are likely to walk away feeling bewildered and, worst of all, indifferent.Ultimately, \"Joker: Folie À Deux\" is a muddled and overwrought sequel that squanders the potential of its predecessor. It aims for high art but crashes under the weight of its own ambitions, delivering a film that is neither thought-provoking nor entertaining.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"I watched this movie joker that left me utterly disappointed, and I must say, it was one of the worst cinematic experiences I have ever encountered. To anyone who is a fan of good movies, I urge you to avoid this film at all costs. From start to finish, it was a disaster in almost every possible way, leaving me thoroughly unimpressed and even frustrated by how poorly executed it was.Let me begin by addressing the characterization of the joker, which, in my opinion, was one of the biggest letdowns of the entire movie. The film attempted to bring the joker character to life, but instead of capturing the essence of this iconic villain, the filmmakers turned him into a real joke, quite literally. The portrayal was so over-the-top, exaggerated, and lacking in depth that it became almost unbearable to watch. Rather than being the menacing, cunning, and psychologically complex character that fans of the genre are familiar with, the joker in this movie was reduced to a caricature. It was almost as if the filmmakers completely misunderstood the appeal of the character and decided to make a mockery of him instead.But the problems didn't stop with just the characterization. The direction of the movie was equally appalling. I've seen bad direction before, but this one took it to a whole new level. There seemed to be no coherent vision, no clear narrative direction, and no sense of pacing. The scenes were disjointed and felt like they were thrown together without much thought or purpose. There was no flow, and at times, it felt like the movie didn't know where it was going. Transitions between scenes were jarring, and instead of building tension or suspense, the film stumbled from one poorly executed scene to another, leaving the audience confused and disengaged.The acting was another major issue. It's hard to believe that talented actors were involved in this project because the performances were utterly lackluster. It felt as though the actors themselves didn't believe in the script or their characters. There was no emotional depth, no connection between the characters, and no chemistry that could have salvaged the weak plot. The lines were delivered in a way that was either too flat or overly dramatic, making it hard to take the movie seriously. It's rare to find a film where almost every performance feels phoned in, but this was one of those rare cases.The movie's beginning was another sore point. Right from the first scene, it became apparent that the film was going to be a tough watch. The start was abrupt, poorly written, and did nothing to establish the world or the characters. There was no build-up, no intrigue, and no reason to care about what was happening. It felt as though the filmmakers were trying too hard to jump straight into the action without setting up any meaningful context. This lack of a solid foundation made it difficult to become invested in the story or care about the outcome.The ending was no better. After enduring two hours of bad direction, acting, and storytelling, the film concluded with one of the worst endings I've ever seen. It was rushed, unsatisfying, and left more questions than answers. Rather than providing a resolution or tying up any loose ends, the movie just abruptly ended, leaving the audience in a state of disbelief. It was as if the filmmakers simply gave up on trying to create a coherent ending and decided to stop the movie without offering any closure.To top it all off, the dialogues in the film were atrocious. The lines were poorly written, often cringe-worthy, and lacked any sense of wit, intelligence, or emotional weight. The dialogue was so bad that it became unintentionally funny at times, which only further detracted from the movie's already weak attempt at serious storytelling.In conclusion, I would strongly advise anyone who values their time and enjoys good cinema to skip this movie altogether. It's not worth watching, even out of curiosity.\",\n",

       "    'Review': '*Joker: Folie à Deux* had high expectations to meet following the success of the first film, but unfortunately, it falls short in several areas. While Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga deliver strong performances, the movie struggles to capture the same intensity and originality that made the first *Joker* a standout.One of the main criticisms is that the sequel feels unnecessary and lacks the gripping narrative of its predecessor. The film is described as a \"dreary, underwhelming, unnecessary slog with much of the story set in Gotham\\'s Arkham Asylum and a courtroom, which fails to engage the audience as effectively as the chaotic streets of Gotham did in the first film.The decision to incorporate musical elements, while ambitious, does not pay off. Critics have noted that the musical numbers, although showcasing Lady Gaga\\'s vocal talents, feel out of place and disrupt the film\\'s tone The courtroom drama aspect is also seen as a misstep, making the movie feel more like a drawn-out legal debate rather than a thrilling psychological explorationAdditionally, the sequel lacks the same social commentary and emotional depth that resonated with audiences in the first film. While *Joker* was praised for its raw portrayal of mental illness and societal neglect, *Folie à Deux* seems to miss the mark, offering a less impactful and more superficial narrativeIn summary, *Joker: Folie à Deux* is a letdown compared to the original. Despite strong performances from its lead actors, the film\\'s disjointed narrative, misplaced musical elements, and lack of compelling storytelling make it a sequel that many fans might find disappointing.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Despite all the painful-to-watch and cringeworthy singing moments, I believe what makes this film a complete disaster is Todd Phillips\\'s failure to recognize that the Joker from the Batman series is not the character he wanted to portray. He aimed to create a film about a broken man finding his place in the world. While in the first film, many of us, at least myself, saw it as a \"set-up\" prologue, in this second installment, it is evident that it wasn\\'t. The character he wanted to flesh out has nothing to do with the Joker from Batman. I would even argue that he played us all for fools, taking advantage of the huge following of the series to obtain the resources he desired.However, this accusation is irrelevant, because what is truly aggravating is the fact that the Joker is supposed to be a kingpin-an insane mastermind who knows how to bend people to his will, even Batman. His insanity is not what makes him scary; it\\'s how his genius conceals it, making the most unsound arguments seem reasonable. This is something that Nolan and Heath Ledger truly understood at its core.I don\\'t care if Todd Phillips wanted to do something different; he should have done it under a different name and not within Batman\\'s universe. In my view, it is terribly disrespectful to those who were expecting a worthy origin story. He knew what he was doing; he wanted to tell the story of a victim-with zero eloquence, zero ambition, zero intelligence, and a dull persona. In Batman, he is anything but. That\\'s why people are upset: \"you get what you deserve\" when you strip a character beyond recognition. Justice has been served by the audience, and honestly, I couldn\\'t be happier for this to become a cautionary tale for anyone who wants to ignore the fact that Batman and the Joker became popular in the first place not because there weren\\'t enough stories around.',\n",

The creators totally lost there marbles on this one, vs the main character.There is a song and dance sequence like every 7-8 minutes. Would have been nice, to have had a heads up that they changed the genre, as alot of us do not watch musicals. Maybe it was to accomodate Lady Gaga, but it totally missed the audiance. Hasn't been too many movies where groups of people are walking out of the cinema, but Joker 2 sure made that milestone. The director also misses a few details from previous movie and the batman franchise.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I've never seen a follow up movie revert so far back with a character when creating a sequel.The joker/arthur fleck at the start feels like he's reverted back to the beginning of the first movie.The back story for Harley Quinn as a character was non existent and changed like it wasn't important. The whole point of Harley is to show the impact of the joker n how he changed her, this was basically skipped.The musical aspect was sickening to the point I left after 1 hour and 15mins because I just couldn't watch it anymore.We've all been made aware of directors straying from source material e.g. Henry cavill with the Witcher series, halo etc.. Here we are again.I understand that the musical aspect worked from the first movie but having the characters in a dark story singing is just bizarre and completely different from having an iconic character dancing to a fitting soundtrack. It felt like the movie and story was adjusted to accommodate GaGa, like she'd had a musical clause in her contract.Overall I've never been so disappointed. To have such potential and destroy it like that was sickening. Surely seeing the Batman and penguin success, the blueprint was there and ignored.If I could get a refund I would. Joker 1 was different but still the joker. I don't even know what to call this. Save your money. Stay at home.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'This is what happens when you have a producer/team that actively hates the movie or show they\\'re supposed to make. Calling this a movie is an insult to other movies.Now I know that some people have a problem with it being a musical, which I\\'m personally not a fan of, but that\\'s somehow the least bad thing about this thing. It\\'s not a decision many people would have made, but it definitely could have worked if this were a stand alone movie, instead of sequel, which it barely is.The problem is more with the message & what they\\'ve done with the main character, which they clearly despise. Why make a movie you don\\'t wanna make, about a character that you hate? Who knows. I\\'d say they did it for a quick paycheck, but that\\'s not gonna happen with this monstrocity.Todd Phillips has admitted that comic movies aren\\'t real movies to him, which is an opinion he\\'s allowed to have, but then why make a comic movie then? And when it turns out to be a success (1st Joker movie) & you still hate it, why would you instead of doing the same thing again, sabotage the movie on purpose just because you personally don\\'t like it?If you don\\'t like the work you\\'re doing but you need the paycheck, there\\'s 2 options. You either do the work for the money or you find a different job that you actually want to do. He picked another option, do the job very poorly so you don\\'t get anything out of it. Not exactly a smart move.Now for the actual message of the movie, it\\'s very clear what they were trying to tell the audience, because of how subtle it was, like a hammer to the face. \"you need to stay in line & do as you\\'re told or there will be consequences. How dare you have hope or agency or stand up for yourself, you must be punished\" a message so despicable it made the audience & the critics agree with each other, which rarely happens, but miracles do exist, they just come in the most unexpected ways.As someone who liked the 1st movie, I\\'ll pretend like this thing doesn\\'t exist. How they managed to build up a character, just to break him down constantly in this is just sad. They really wanted to make us dislike this movie & they\\'ve succeeded.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"To me this is worst than the room in all the bad ways.i don't know how this man got an Oscar. Why was it even put in theatres. Big stain on everyone involved careers .To call it a film would be generous-it's more of a disjointed, pretentious mess disguised as something profound. The pacing is unbearable, like it's trying so hard to stretch its shallow material over a bloated runtime, all while pretending it has something deep to say. The script is an incoherent mix of clichés and empty provocations, with dialogue that sounds like it was written by someone who just discovered edgy internet forums.Joaquin Phoenix's performance, while praised by many, felt like nothing more than a series of exaggerated facial contortions and tics without any real depth behind them. It was more about spectacle than substance, and it's baffling that this one-dimensional portrayal was awarded with an Oscar. The film's attempt at psychological exploration is laughably superficial, and its forced edginess comes off as desperate.As for the direction, it feels like Todd Phillips was trying to mimic better filmmakers but missed the mark entirely. The tone is all over the place, and the cinematography, which some have praised, feels more like a cheap imitation of Scorsese's style. The whole thing reeks of self-importance without any justification for it.It's a film that mistakes being grim and joyless for being meaningful. The fact that it made it to theaters, let alone received critical acclaim, says more about the current state of Hollywood than the actual quality of this movie. Every person involved should seriously reconsider their creative choices.\",\n",

I recommend the first movie it's a really perfect depiction of a disturbed psychopath. I feel the director has lost his way in the sequel. Joker 2 is the worst sequel I have ever seen. The director has made it into a musical. Joaquin Phoenix is reduced to a co star in a really poor ripoff of LaLa Land the musical. I drove 30 miles and paid to watch this and was disappointed.Didn't anyone in the production of this film see the massive disappointment they were about to deliver.Didn't someone say along the way, we are making it into a musical.Joker was so good its sequel was expected to match or exceed it.A message to the director.

The tonal shift is so stark that it's hard to believe this is even the same character or world. Instead of delving deeper into Arthur Fleck's psyche, the film suddenly bursts into song and dance, completely disrupting the tension and grit that defined the first movie.Joaquin Phoenix, who brilliantly portrayed the tortured soul of Arthur in the first film, seems lost here. While he is still committed to the role, the musical format doesn't suit him or the character. It's hard to take the film seriously when moments of emotional intensity are broken up by surreal, Broadway-style performances that seem plucked from a different movie entirely.\",\n",

I don't need constant action to entertain me, but this movie had virtually nothing. It was just a man in jail, a man in a courtroom, and a man on the streets. All that it really did was tell us about the first movie, which constantly reminded me of how much better it was.When the credits rolled, I felt as if genuinely not a single second of that movie was enjoyable in the slightest and that I had completely and totally wasted my time. In fact, I'd argue that the ending is insulting to anyone who even moderately liked the first one simply because this whole movie accomplished absolutely nothing!I can not overstate how much nothing is going on here.

It's not telling a story, or an interesting one at least. While you know that there is growth on Joaquin's character, it doesn't makes sense, there is no real development, and as most elements in the movie it feels forced.-Length. The movie is unnecessarily long - there are no interesting dialogs, nothing that justifies its. To me, this boils down to poor editing. A sequence of a character walking to a jury stand takes over a minute, with no reason of being there, no purpose at all. What a waste of talents and resources.-The music. I knew it was a musical, and I actually enjoy them. Also, I used to like Lady Gaga's singing. But singing is so forced. Whenever the movie gives a glimpse of coherence, your ears start getting abused by the unnecessary, odd singing. Just because you have a singer in the cast, doesn't mean that you have to make her sing every time she comes into the screen. It felt like a hook or promo for LG, or a long music video that no one ask to see.Overall I feel bad for all of the people that work hard into making such a movie, the actors, extras, production, even investors - they are all doing their best. But not even Joaquin Phoenix can save such a mess of a movie.\",\n",

How can a movie studio in Hollywood approve a movie like this? There's a lot of pointless and boring singing and the plot and ending are a disaster. The whole story of Joker as we know it is simply changed here. You hope in vain that the Joker will finally develop into the Joker you know and admire him for. I loved the first Joker movie and couldn't wait to see the sequel. But when I found out that they had turned it into a musical, the joy was gone again. Unfortunately, I still went to the movies hoping that it wouldn't be so bad. However, it was much worse than I could have imagined. I used to love Lady Gaga, but in this movie, with all the stupid singing, she was just annoying.Please don't watch this movie. It's not worth the time and money.\",\n",

Yea, sure, no possible way that you just happen to enjoy a terrible film right? The movie is pretentious, the plot is paper thin, and yes, there is way too much singing. It\\'s hard to put into words how badly I dislike this movie.Joker 2 is actually a perfect Joker movie in a way because it is in fact a complete joke. As many have stated, this movie was dead the moment they decided to make it a musical. Those who like musicals in general is already a very small audience. Those who like musicals and enjoyed the first Joker has to be such a tiny number it makes you wonder what the execs who greenlit this sequel were thinking because it was a truly awful film to sit through.There is a reason virtually all live action versions of Harley Quinn have felt so bad in recent years, and it\\'s because Hollywood is too scared to write her as she\\'s supposed to be. The real Harley is supposed to be obsessed, infatuated, and completely crazy about Joker. For obvious reasons, Hollywood will not put this on screen because they\\'re terrified of being called s*xist. Harley just has to be a stronk woman now and that\\'s just never going to work because that\\'s not what she is as a character. Simple as that.Terrible movie, don\\'t waste your money as this movie will be streaming inside of 6 weeks.',\n",

While the original film captured the essence of the iconic character in a fresh and compelling way, the sequel struggles to find its footing and lacks the depth and complexity that made the first film so memorable.One of the key issues with \"Joker 2\" is its reliance on shock value and gratuitous violence, rather than exploring the character\\'s psychological depth and societal commentary as effectively as the first film did. The sequel feels more like a superficial attempt to replicate the success of the original, rather than offering a meaningful continuation of the story.Furthermore, the performances in \"Joker 2\" lack the raw emotional power that Joaquin Phoenix brought to the role in the first film. The character development feels shallow and forced, with the protagonist\\'s descent into madness coming across as contrived rather than organic.In terms of narrative structure, \"Joker 2\" feels disjointed and unfocused, with subplots that fail to connect in a meaningful way. The pacing is uneven, with long stretches of dull exposition followed by rushed and chaotic sequences that lack coherence.Overall, \"Joker 2\" fails to capture the magic of the original film, instead succumbing to clichés and missed opportunities. While there are moments of visual flair and stylistic bravado, they cannot save the film from its lackluster storytelling and uninspired direction.In conclusion, \"Joker 2\" is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to the lofty expectations set by its predecessor. It lacks the depth, nuance, and emotional resonance that made the original \"Joker\" a modern masterpiece, ultimately falling flat in its attempt to recapture the lightning in a bottle that made the first film so unforgettable.',\n",

The juxtaposition of upbeat songs with the film's heavy subject matter created a jarring dissonance that left the audience feeling confused and disconnected.Joaquin Phoenix delivered another strong performance as the titular character, but even his talent couldn't salvage a film that was fundamentally flawed. Lady Gaga's casting was intriguing, but her character felt underdeveloped and her singing, while impressive, didn't quite fit the world of the film.The story itself was predictable and lacked the depth and complexity of the original. The film's exploration of mental illness felt superficial, and the ending was unsatisfying and left many questions unanswered.In conclusion, Joker: Folie à Deux is a missed opportunity. It squandered the potential of the franchise and failed to live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. Fans of the first film will likely be disappointed by this sequel, which feels more like a cash grab than a genuine attempt to continue the story.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie A Deux or more appropriately Joker: F Me And You, is the single most disrespectful movie towards a character I've seen in my life. If you think I'm being hyperbolic, look at the scores I typically give, 90% of the time I give movies or shows scores it's either a 9 or 10 out of 10. This movie, however, is a special kind of disgrace.What makes it even more frustrating, is unlike most garbage movies, this is well shot, well-acted, and has genuinely good moments in it. A courtroom scene in particular is remarkably well done. Visually, it's superb. But anytime an ounce of momentum gets built within the story, it's cut off by a stupid musical number and has to start over from square one. That happens time and time again until you can't wait for the movie to end.When it does, you're left wondering...how did this get made? It retroactively ruins a solid first entry, does everything it can to embarrass the most iconic villain in fiction, and was somehow still pointless. It ends exactly where the movie started. If you cut the first two hours and only left us with the final scene, nothing about the movie changes, except the audience would feel less insulted.\",\n",

They approached from a unique angle and developed a great character for us to invest in.In a time when superhero movies had all gone to a ridiculous large scale with multiverses and alien invasions (which I enjoy), I really like that the original felt more reality based. I recommended it to people that don't even particularly like superhero stuff. It was a great drama that happened to be about a comic book character. But the core audience was still Batman fans. It's not an audience that was calling for a musical. I'm all in favour of people taking chances with being creative but think this should have been something done with a different joker and completely stand alone.The original was an amazing film. Could easily have been left alone or build its own franchise. Now they've buried it. Such a waste of great potential.\",\n",

This film is a disservice to the iconic character of the Joker and a waste of your time and money.The storyline, such as it is, is a flimsy excuse for a movie. It's a disjointed mess that jumps from scene to scene without any clear direction or purpose. The plot is so thin that it's practically transparent, and the pacing is sluggish and unengaging. Its unfortunate inclusion of gratuitous gayism in the early stages left me feeling disappointed and disengaged.What's even more disappointing is the treatment of the Joker character. The iconic villain is reduced to a caricature of himself, stripped of his complexity and depth. The portrayal is shallow and one-dimensional, lacking the nuance and psychological intrigue that has made the Joker such a compelling character in the past.The only saving grace of this film is the musical score, which is surprisingly well-done (Sarcasm hits everyone). However, it's not enough to salvage the overall experience. The music is completely overshadowed by the lackluster acting, direction, and writing.I would strongly advise against watching Joker Folie a Deux. It's a waste of your time and money, and it will leave you feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. If you're looking for a good movie, I recommend checking out something else. There are plenty of better options out there.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I went into Joker 2024 with high expectations, especially after the success of the 2019 film. Unfortunately, this sequel was a complete letdown. The plot felt disjointed and lacked the depth that made the first Joker so impactful. Rather than expanding on Arthur Fleck's psychological journey, it seemed like the film was trying too hard to capitalize on the original's success without adding anything meaningful.The addition of Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn was unnecessary and felt forced. Her character didn't add any value to the story, and her portrayal came across as more of a distraction than an asset. It almost felt like a stunt casting decision rather than a thoughtful addition to the narrative. Instead of delving deeper into the twisted dynamics of Joker's mind, the film shifted its focus to musical numbers and melodrama, which diluted the dark and gritty atmosphere that fans were hoping for.Visually, the film tried to replicate the aesthetic of its predecessor, but even that fell flat. The cinematography lacked the raw intensity that made the original Joker stand out, and the pacing dragged, making the film feel much longer than it needed to be.In the end, Joker 2024 feels like a missed opportunity. Instead of exploring new and complex ideas, it rehashes old themes with less impact. It's a pale imitation of the original, and sadly, it just didn't live up to the hype.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'My expectation: this should be the best movie in 2024, even better than Dune 2 possibly.Reality: Me audience turn into a real joker.As a huge fan of the first \"Joker,\" my anticipation for \"Joker 2\" was through the roof. The original film delivered a powerful blend of character study and social commentary, leaving audiences captivated by Arthur Fleck\\'s descent into madness. I expected the sequel to elevate this experience, possibly even surpassing other cinematic giants of 2024, like \"Dune: Part Two.\" However, the reality of \"Joker 2\" transformed my excitement into a disheartening experience, leaving me feeling more like a \"real joker\" than an entertained moviegoer.From the moment the film began, it was clear that the tone was markedly different. The striking visuals and haunting score that characterized the first film felt absent, replaced by a muddled narrative that struggled to find its footing. While I had hoped for a deep exploration of Arthur\\'s psyche and the societal factors that shaped him, the sequel instead meandered through disjointed storylines and underdeveloped characters. It felt as though the filmmakers were attempting to replicate the success of the first film without fully understanding what made it resonate with audiences.One of my main disappointments was the handling of supporting characters. The original \"Joker\" featured a memorable cast that complemented Arthur\\'s journey, but \"Joker 2\" felt like a missed opportunity. Instead of providing depth and context, many characters were mere shadows of their potential, leaving me yearning for more substance. It was frustrating to watch as the film juggled various subplots, none of which managed to coalesce into a coherent narrative.Furthermore, the pacing of \"Joker 2\" left much to be desired. Moments that could have been powerful and impactful were often rushed, while less significant scenes dragged on. This uneven pacing contributed to a sense of disconnection from the characters, making it difficult for me to engage with their struggles. By the time the film reached its climax, I found myself emotionally detached, unable to invest in the outcome of Arthur\\'s journey.Visually, I had expected the same level of artistry that marked the first film. Instead, \"Joker 2\" seemed to rely on gimmicks rather than innovation. The cinematography lacked the striking imagery that made the original so iconic, and the score, once a haunting presence, felt generic and uninspired. The film failed to create the atmospheric tension that had drawn me into Arthur\\'s world in the first place.In conclusion, while my expectations for \"Joker 2\" were sky-high, the reality was a disheartening experience that left me feeling like a true joker. The film\\'s failure to deliver a compelling narrative, coupled with its underdeveloped characters and lackluster visuals, made for a disappointing viewing experience. As I reflect on my journey through this sequel, I can\\'t help but wish it had embraced the depth and artistry that made the original so unforgettable. For those seeking a continuation of Arthur Fleck\\'s story, be prepared for a ride that may leave you feeling more bewildered than entertained.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker 2: A Tedious Misfire That Misses the MarkWhen the first *Joker* movie was released in 2019, it arrived like a punch to the gut-a bold, daring take on the iconic villain that managed to be both thought-provoking and entertaining. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance captured the essence of a man spiraling into madness, set against a backdrop of societal decay, making it a cinematic masterpiece. However, any goodwill that was earned by the first film has been obliterated by *Joker 2*, a tedious, pretentious sequel that is a pale shadow of its predecessor.Let\\'s not mince words here: *Joker 2* is a complete disaster. The movie is a plodding, slow-burn slog through two hours of absolutely nothing of value. It lacks not only the excitement and intensity that defined the first film, but also any sense of direction or purpose. Instead of offering a deep dive into the psyche of its disturbed protagonist, the film meanders aimlessly, giving audiences little more than a meandering mess of disjointed scenes and underwhelming performances.To call this movie boring would be an understatement. The pacing is so glacial it makes watching paint dry feel like a thrill ride. The tension that was so palpable in the first *Joker* is nowhere to be found. Instead, we are left with long, drawn-out scenes that serve no purpose other than to test the viewer\\'s patience. Each moment feels like it was stretched out to fill time, with no regard for whether it actually contributes to the narrative or character development. The \"slow-burn\" approach might work if there was some payoff or if the scenes built towards something profound. But in *Joker 2*, there is no payoff. No crescendo. No catharsis. Just an interminable, soul-crushing march toward nothingness.And then there\\'s Lady Gaga, whose inclusion in this movie is one of its biggest missteps. The idea of casting her might have sounded good on paper, but in practice, it\\'s a monumental failure. Her portrayal is laughably bad, a grating and uninspired performance that is more annoying than anything else. To say she can\\'t sing would be too kind. It\\'s as if the filmmakers were trying to shove her into this film in an effort to make it more \"artsy\" or \"avant-garde,\" but instead, it backfires spectacularly. Every time she\\'s on screen, it feels like a bad karaoke night that refuses to end.Speaking of which, why was there so much emphasis on musical elements in this movie? Did we sign up for a crime drama or an amateur cabaret? If I wanted to sit through a painfully awkward musical performance, I\\'d watch an off-Broadway show in a basement theater. But this is supposed to be *Joker 2*-a follow-up to one of the most intense, psychological films of the past decade-and what we get instead is a painfully cringeworthy attempt at blending musical and crime drama elements that feel as mismatched as oil and water.The film, at times, resembles a bad episode of *Law and Order*-not in its best seasons, mind you, but in those filler episodes they cranked out to pad a season. The crime and tension that were integral to the first *Joker* film are now replaced by dull, predictable scenes that wouldn\\'t be out of place in a third-rate procedural. If you\\'ve seen one crime scene in this movie, you\\'ve seen them all. The drama, the stakes, the intrigue-everything that should define a great crime movie-are completely absent here.The writing is perhaps the worst offender. It\\'s as if the screenwriters forgot what made the first film work. The gritty realism, the visceral sense of tension, the tragic spiral of a man lost in his own mental instability-it\\'s all gone. Instead, we get what amounts to a second-rate art-house film trying to pass off pretension as depth. It feels like the writers believed that by slowing everything down, by dragging every scene past its breaking point, they were creating something profound. In reality, they just produced something unbearable.Even Phoenix, as talented as he is, can\\'t save this train wreck. It\\'s hard to blame him, though-what can an actor do when the script gives him so little to work with? His character feels flat, drained of the energy and complexity that made him so compelling in the first film. Gone is the tormented, unpredictable force of nature. In his place is a character so stripped of nuance that even Phoenix seems to be sleepwalking through his scenes.If you were expecting an exhilarating, thought-provoking follow-up to the first *Joker*, you will be sorely disappointed. What we have here is a vapid, tiresome exercise in patience, a film so devoid of excitement or substance that it feels like an insult to anyone who admired the original. *Joker 2* is not just bad-it\\'s offensively bad, a movie so misguided and poorly executed that it feels like a slap in the face to anyone who enjoyed the first film.',\n",

More than enraged I am insulted at the level of disregard to one of the greatest characters ever created.The fault falls on Todd Phillips, Warner rothers and DC, they should never be allowed to make another film in their entire miserable lifespan.I came into the movie wanting it to prove everyone wrong, to give me a sense of awe and marvel, instead I came out hating cinema at its very foundation, no movie in my entire life has made me feel this way.Every copy of this film should be burn, destroyed and buried, along with the career if Todd Phillips, who does not deserve the privileges bestowed upon him.Loving cinema sometimes means loathing it. I have seen more than my fair share of horse crap movies. But Joker: Folie à Deux is without the shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie I ever seen in my entire life.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'This second installment of Joker, Folie à Deux, is not only an artistic betrayal but also an affront to the legacy of the iconic character that is the Joker. From the very first moments, it becomes clear that the film seeks to demystify and disarm what makes the Clown Prince of Crime so great and terrifying. The Joker, in his original form, is the embodiment of pure chaos, a being whose complete lack of remorse and conscience is his strength and allure. Yet, this film makes the tragic mistake of over-humanizing him.By showing him vulnerable, filled with doubts, remorse, and regrets, the film strips away what makes him so magnetic: his absolute refusal to conform to societal rules, his relentless nihilism. The audience is faced with a broken man, sick, tormented by his identity, which not only breaks with what the character represents but is also deeply disappointing for those expecting to see the Joker we know and fear.This approach, far from adding depth, actually dilutes the complexity of the Joker. Where pure and unpredictable madness once reigned, we are now subjected to clumsy introspection that betrays not only the character\\'s DNA but also the essence of what made the first installment so successful. The Joker is not a man to be understood or excused; he is a force of disorder, the very personification of chaos.In the end, this film feels more like a disjointed psychological exploration, a spin-off that might have been interesting for another character but certainly not for the Joker. In trying to make him more \"human,\" the film removes everything that makes him unique and terrifying. A weakened, lost Joker, unable to recognize himself in his own actions, is a true insult to the legacy of this iconic character.',\n",

They spent a lot of time going over the causes of his trauma, his obsession with being on a late night talk show, and finally the outburst that would display his true madness. Chain-smoking aside, it was a good movie.THIS MOVIE, however, fell flat for me. As I noticed in the first movie, although I sort of enjoyed it, it seems the writers and actors had no prior knowledge of the characters. Harleen Quinzel was a psychologist whose sessions with Joker began to crack her sanity until she developed an obsessive love for him. In this movie, she's a patient with a Joker obsession, completely negating the nuance of their relathionship. It would've been far more interesting to see the original verion, interviewing Joker, beginning to empathize with him, and then develop an obsession; something more gradual rather than forced.While they introduced some interesting concepts like Harvey Dent and the movie's ending, I didn't enjoy the overall product.\",\n",

The cinematography is striking, and the soundtrack once again plays a key role in setting the eerie, unsettling tone. The performances, especially from Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, are committed and intense, elevating the film\\'s character-driven moments. However, the storyline at times meanders and leans into more theatrical territory, making it feel less grounded and more abstract than the original.While the actors deliver impressive performances, the development of Arthur and Harley\\'s relationship feels rushed in parts, and the film doesn\\'t delve as deeply into their psychological complexities as it could.

       "    'Review': \"I am 57 years old and I have seen hundreds of films in my life. I can honestly say that this is the absolute worst film I have ever seen. It is a piece of utter crap. Something that is an open insult to an audience that has paid good money to waste two hours of their lives. There is absolutely nothing in this film, it's a vacuous, empty and meaningless waste of time. The first film was a tragic masterpiece that was in a strange sort of way actually quite moving. You could at least feel a grain of sympathy for someone who had been abused all his life and finally cracked in a burst of insane violence. But this film lacked any kind of storyline and the Lady Gaga character was not even explained properly, she just appeared out of nowhere, a complete nonentity with no purpose. The Joker himself appeared resigned, sullen and uninteresting - completely different from the original film. The ending and the Joker's fate was not surprising, but again, it was sudden and unexplained, no real motive behind it. This piece of crap is absolutely shameful, and I hope this director is not given any more opportunities to produce junk such as this.\",\n",

They don\\'t try to make us laugh even once, not genuinely. The tone is unrelentingly grim.It\\'s not clever. The jukebox musical numbers are inserted carelessly and add absolutely nothing to the plot, which in itself is practically non-existent.It\\'s not well-staged. There isn\\'t a single memorable set piece in the entire godawful production. It\\'s actually quite gawdy and awkward.It\\'s not interesting. The \"plot,\" such as it is, rambles and stagnates and stutters from point to point without any sense of purpose or direction.It\\'s not well-acted. Lady GaGa is completely wasted, both as an actress and a singer. Joaquin Phoenix is wasted too, as he barely even spends any time as his Joker alter-ego, and his time as Arthur Fleck is dreadfully dull.It\\'s frankly painful to sit through.Whether or not that was the point of making it, I truly don\\'t care. It has zero redeeming qualities.It should be played over and over again to violent criminals in institutions as a method of torture.',\n",

But Todd Philips decided to be Todd Philips and make another wasteful sequel to a great stand alone story. I had low expectations but dear God it was worse than that! It is a musical... That doesn\\'t work! The dark tones the first Joker film had that made it so special and feel so good are ruined here. This is basically how the musical works, Remember when Arthur Fleck discovered those papers indicating he was adopted and Tortured as a child in the first film? Imagine if he discovered that and just started cheerfully signing after that... That\\'s what this movie is! It was so painful that is why it was a kick to the brain. I don\\'t know if I feel stupid for trying to think this would be decent or Stupid not to see the clear money grab Todd Philips just robbed of me. Please, appreciate solo stories.',\n",

Law & Order is better on most weeks and , thankfully , also shorter.Is it a musical? Not really enough music to fit that bill and frankly the plot to Tommy made more sense.Is it a comic book movie? Maybe an unfinished mini series by Silver Wolf that just faded out from lack of interest I guess.Is it good? Lord no.No matter what it is you will come into this film expecting it will let you down in every way.Even if you come in hoping to just see the train wreck Todd created as a clear and blatant cash grab even in that it just falls flatter than a fart no one else ever hears.And that is it isn\\'t it? This was all just a cash grab by the production.Todd Phillips should have learned he was not very good with sequels the last time around.Gaga is no Margot Robbie in the role of Harley. Phoenix looks like he realized what he was into after he was already contractually obligated.Go re-watch the first. Go watch one of the Harley flicks or the as good as gold season 1 of the cartoon she had. Go clip your nails.

Furthermore, there was a clear limit to Joker's potential by trying to not resemble Kieth Ledger's version. If there was more freedom to explore the dramatic nature of Joker's personality, then the film would have been more of a success. Throughout the film, there were a lot of mysteries that kept me entertained, but didn't turn out as satisfying as they did in the first movie. Finally, the film evokes numerous emotions and may effect the audience in an angy matter.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'I don\\'t think the reviews on IMDB do justice to what a God Awful job the creators of this film achieved. Okay it\\'s a musical, but the least they could have done is make the musical numbers relevant to the story-line. I may as well have been watching Puddles Pity Party Feat Lady Gaga (which ironically I probably would enjoy)..\\nThe film is basically a court room drama, with a romance sideline story. There is absolutely nothing DC about this film apart from Location and Character names. You could Joker to Janitor, Change Gotham to Chicago, and have Lady Gaga play a character of a different name, and the film would be pretty much identical.And to anyone interested YES it IS a musical. I estimate that about 50% of the film are musical numbers that don\\'t move the story along.I think what vexes me the most is the cast. It\\'s great!, and the actual ACTING is fantastic. But this film did not work because some \"Blue-sky-thinker\" at Warner Bros, said in a board meeting \"Hey, here\\'s a crazy idea... Why don\\'t we make it a musical???\". To whomever that person is, I hope your personal hell is watching this film on repeat for the rest of eternity.... Actually no.. I have sat through this film, and the once I sat through it felt like an eternity. I wouldn\\'t want to wish that on anyone.One of the first things someone is going to do when this hits the internet is go through and re-edit this film to cut out all the musical numbers.I would like to go further, but fear that my account would be deactivated if I actually said what I want to.',\n",

Nothing made sense in this film, from the sequence of events to the characters. At one point, the judge says he won\\'t tolerate any circus in his courtroom, yet the entire movie was a circus.They made this mess just for the final scene, where Joker is killed by the \"real\" Joker, hoping to pave the way for a third part.

It's a deconstruction of the first film, with meta elements similar to the matrix 4, if you loved that movie then this is for you and you alone, for everyone else you will hate this film, it's trying so hard to stick a middle finger up at you as revenge for you not enjoying joker 1 the way todd wanted you to and for daring to have your own opinions and to think for yourself and see Arthur Fleck like Todd wanted you to, a sad and pathetic loser who was worth nothing and committed horrible atrocities (in his view) who deserved no sympathy, after the fact (once the movie released and was a massive success)The movie is a beautiful train wreck, it looks visually stunning and is well shot and the technical aspects are pretty much 10/10 but is made purely as an F U to all those who loved the first. It a musical with terrible original songs that are spectical only and don't make you feel anything, south park did it better 23 years ago. The story is paper thin and gave away the ending with the trailer, typical Hollywood.People say the ending is controversial but it's not really once you know how Todd felt after the success of the first. Todd makes sure it's painfully obvious he's giving you the complete opposite of what a fan would want from this movie and the ending is just the nails in the coffin.At many points the ending included you think you're going to finally get some satisfaction and get what you came to see but no, the film is just subverting expections the movie. The ending is absolutely horrendous and literally ra**es the predecessor, I would of honestly preferred Arthur hit his head and woke up from a dream to then have the credits roll.If you're a fan of the first avoid like the plague this is honestly one of the worst sequels ever made.I hope it bombs and Todd Phillips's reputation never recovers.He did a hangover 3 again, I hope he never makes another movie.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"When the cartoon show opened the sequel showing Arthur The Joker impersonated by his shadow to take the stage and getting brutally thrashed by Police filling the screen with blood to show the title of the sequel, I got goosebumps. But, soon after the story revealed and it was actually looking freezed for adding literally nothing new to Joker, I got pissed. Lady Gaga is just a showpiece in this. No background story of her. What she tells to Arthur is also admitted as a lie by herself. Obviously, this movie that shows The Joker put in trial after the court should have a good argument from Prosecution & Defence. Sadly, this one fails too. Watch this only for Phoenix who has acted well, but provided with a story way below The Joker legacy. This sequel is like a coffin for that Masterpiece Original JOKER. I wish I had never seen this one as it took away the admiration I'd for JOKER to a great extent. If you want to try this, please leave any expectations based on the original. It is good for nothing.\",\n",

Why?? Just because she can sing? How about acting?

It is so far away from the real origins of the original Joker and associated films...shocking!I can't remember the last time a film ended and the general vibe, from the audience, was so underwhelming. What were the scriptwriters and Directors thinking? They totally mishandled the stewardship of the franchise.The lead actors are good - but there was so much depth that could have been unlocked by those actors with the right script. So, it was a wasted opportunity and an experiment, gone wrong.If there is a 3rd film to the series - and I hope there is, then please make sure it returns to it's origins - instead of making another pantomime.\",\n",

Arkham inmates might as well have been given a spoonful of sugar to help their medicine go down! However, this really doesn't work as a savy cinematography trick that's convincing of psychosis either-more like a meloncholy Gotham crossed with Grease. It's just not the one that I want. Arthur Fleck is a pitiful Joker. This killer is given that tiresome 'victim' angle from which he never transcends into the legendary supervillain. The only tie to the traditional DC Joker is face paint and a goofy laugh. It's a long, drawn out, boring, pointless sequel that leads nowhere.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Let me just start things off as simple as possible and if you want to read the rest of the review, that's fine. This is the worst sequel ever made.If you are a fan of that first joker movie and if you're a comic book fan in general... this movie hates you, and everyone that supported the first joker. This is a middle finger to an entire fanbase in cinematic form. Everyone that agreed to do this movie, including Lady Gaga, Joaquin Phoenix, Todd Phillips, and all of the returning cast and crew should be ashamed of themselves.I'm not gonna spoil the movie, but I have to be honest with you... Don't see this. Hes not even the Joker throughout most of the film, unless it some of the musical numbers OH YEAH BY THE WAY, this is a musical now. Also, the ending doesn't make any sense and it basically ruins not only this entire movie but the first movie as well. They're basically is no story by the way. Without the musical numbers, this movie would be 45 minutes long and to be honest with you with the way the story goes. There's no reason for this movie to exist. Literally zero. Also, they completely change Harley Quinn's character, And even the same character anymore in fact, they don't even call her Harley. Might as well have not even use her in this movie and just called her a completely different person and it would've been exactly the same same. Arthur Fleck also doesn't act at all like how he did at the end of the first movie and it kind of retracts back to how he was at the beginning which doesn't make sense because the whole point of that first movie is that he evolved into the joker. There's a ton of holes in this movie and people show back up and things happen in this that don't match up at all with the first movie. And I understand that they keep using the excuse that he imagines and always hallucinates things, but that can only go so far. This movie literally seemed like Todd Phillips made a fake script and sent it to the studio because he didn't want to do a sequel but the studio couldn't figure that out and they made him make the movie anyway and now he's being forced to make a fake script for a movie that he didn't wanna make. That's honestly how it feels. It really does feel like at the end though that this movie was an intentional , stab in the back to all the people that were fans with that first movie. Because it's so cynical towards not just the people that follow the joker and who the joker is, but also that a fan of the comics in general and also other adaptations of those comics. There's one Instance, especially towards the end, that is not only extremely confusing, but it's also just really disrespectful and insulting in general that makes it seem like the person who made this movie was genuinely trying to piss people off.So yeah... I think it goes without saying at this point I did not like this movie. But I have to be honest with you. I have never hated a film more in my entire life. This movie has wasted my time, and my money, and Many many many months of not only being excited for this movie but also for the first movie as well and which this movie destroys coinciding. If you like the first joker, please do not watch this. This is without a doubt, my least favorite movie of all time.\",\n",

More than one online periodical is arguing that this movie was made with malice towards the Batman franchise, as well as its fans, some news outlets even applauding this decision: hailing it as a \"subversion\" of the superhero genre.Fans of the comic books and prior Batman movies regard the Joker as the criminal mastermind and complex character he was originally written to be. Those moviegoers are expecting a tense and violent drama, hearty action sequences, and blood and gore. The decision to greenlight a musical and legal procedural Joker sequel is a massive faux pas; one that cannot be excused thru ignorance or even creativity. No, this decision was done knowing the consequences, which are now manifesting as disbelief, anger, frustration and a pathetic box office reception.One of my acting teachers in Manhattan explained to me that \"America does not want to come home to Medea\", meaning that the average American comes home from a brutal day at work and is received by chores, disobedient children, bills, endless worries and never-ending demands. They want to relax. They want to be entertained. There is a time and place for thoughtful, deeply reflective cinema, and this is not it. -- There is absolutely nothing wrong with a subculture of action movie goers -- They appreciate the fun and excitement the excessive violence causes them to feel. It\\'s fiction and fantasy and has its place in our life as a distraction; one that the incredibly responsible working class deserves.For Hollywood millionaires and their lackeys to be able to suggest, authorize, produce and distribute such an incredibly pompous and miserly film using a franchise that stands for the exact opposite themes it embodies is a clear sign of an industry gone terribly wrong. An industry that answers to no one and is funded under feigned interest to inform and educate when it clearly patronizes with disdain, untroubled by any repercussions.',\n",

Director Todd Philips crafts the story of Joker and Harley Quinn and the romance surrounding them but despite it's production, costumes, and performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga being solid, Joker: Folie à Deux ends up falling into issue of style over substance which causes the movie fall into the lines of: pretentious filmmaking.Joker was a solid movie that has some interesting themes and concepts while being slightly bloated with itself. Unfortunately, this sequel ends up being a bit too full of itself with its simple narrative that ends up making it's themes feel bloated, predictable, and honestly, uninteresting. The atmosphere, musical score, production, and style tries to make it seem the narrative is better and greater, however, as a whole, the narrative is really messy and basic which really drags the movie down and makes it feel like a bore fest. On the musical score, the musical score is solid but the singing was mostly alright and the songs are pretty forgettable.The characters of Joker and Harley have some interesting charm and dynamics between them, but despite the strong performance from Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, the laughably dialogue, uninteresting side characters, and tone that takes itself WAY too seriously doesn't do much justice. Including Philips' direction being kind of all over the place.Philips really tries to grasp hard to move away from the derivative comedy movies in his past career and lean into dramatic works but unfortunately, he seems to fail to stray away from it.At the end, Todd Philips tries to make something serious but unfortunately fails to successfully strive with a dramatic tale.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"After waiting 5 years for the sequel to the original Joker (2019), I felt that this simply was not what I nor many others were looking for. The first film, starring Joaquin Phoenix was a veritable masterpiece that left the audience chomping at the bit for more. It was an elegant commentary on the downfall of society in a fictitious New York City, and the outcasts that were shadows, ignored by the elites, with a heavy look into mental health. This continuation was none of that. It lacked direction and the tempo was inconsistent. Every time a storyline would get going and the audience was drawn in, there would be yet another musical number, turning a flowing movie into a staccato of disconnect. This film feels like a loose Joker story that's been precariously wrapped around a Lady Gaga album, and not her good ones either. There was very little that redeems this movie, apart from the sets and costuming. Phoenix is an amazing, talented actor, but even he could not make this series rise from the ashes.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I just saw Joker 2 in the cinema, and boy, oh boy, it is, well, terrible. As others have mentioned, it is not because the acting, music, direction, singing, or any other obvious aspect of it is bad. It is all very well executed, and Gaga, Pheonix and everybody else did a good job. Bravo, well done.So yes, it does not deserve one star.So what is wrong with it? Well read on to find out.The first movie, although not perfect, was very good. Why can't the first movie just be left alone then? Does everything very good, need a sequal?Because this sequal, tries the very best it can to UNDO everything that happened in the first movie. It tries to rectify, all the evil of the world (Gotham) and make everything right again. I will not be going into any more detail than that, because that will spoil both the first movie, and this one.But we as an audience, don't need anything to be put to rights! We don't need anything that the second movie has to offer: We are in the theater to escape our miserable lives, and to be entertained for two and a half hours. To watch something even more miserable, which this is, is not an escape.So what makes this movie so miserable you ask? Hold on to your popcorn, because here it comes:THIS SEQUAL wants us to NOT forget that Joker is fiction, and that to me, seeking an escape from reality, is the biggest insult of all.I am not stupid. I know Joker is fiction, I don't need to be told this through a movie with the same name.Should I feel guilty for routing for Joker in the first movie? According to this movie: Yes, I should be very ashamed indeed.So yes, I am sorry folks. If you can, avoid this movie at all costs! It is an insult to everyone involved with cinema, and everybody who just wants an escape, every once in a while.\",\n",

The only reason this sequel exists is for the cynical cash grab and so artsy people get to make artsy movies. Hollywood and the East Coast think the rest of us grew up in private schools and we are all actors and writers. No one that liked The Joker ever asked for a musical. Then you mix that with courtroom drama? Why not sprinkle a little summer stock comedy throughout as well? How about some Shakespeare?Lady Gaga gets type cast which is too bad because if anyone gave a crap and actually wanted to make a dark movie about these characters she could probably turn a really interesting performance in, but I guess we'll never know. If you grew up in theater class from the time you were 4 years old or went to Harvard and studied theater you're going to love this movie.\",\n",

Fifteen minutes after, I started thinking oh ok, I can sort of understand why they've decided to add some musical numbers. But then, and for the rest of the 2hr 18 minutes film I kept asking myself what the actual (expletive) am I watching here?!? This is truly awful!I really enjoyed the first film and whilst I think it took a reductionist approach to mental illness I still believe that the first film was well directed, with some of the visuals being pure magic at times. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant, the supporting cast led by Robert de Niro was excellent.Folie à Deux is, simply put, a pointless film and I expect it to be a monumental flop. I can only imagine the early development workshops for this film. 'How about we take our celebrated film in a completely different direction! Let's not have a story or a plot to drive it, let's chuck in Lady Gaga because she's still appealing to 12% of our preferred demographic meaning that we can turn this into a musical, but (here's the key concept) we'll only include the most irritating music imaginable.' To which the Executive Producers respond: 'I like it!'An angry score of 2 stars because I'm generous. 1 star each for Joaquin Phoenix for his portrayal of a sad, weak and pathetic joker and Lady Gaga who was surprisingly good (pointless but good). Anyone who enjoyed the original will in all likelihood hate this sequel. Save your money, let it flop.\",\n",

Its the aftermath, Arthur imprisoned. Awaiting trial. And court sequences. A climatic escape. But to come back in full circle.The direction was dumb. Director tried to make this a musical. Big mistake. A lot of the musical sequences is all in Arthurs head. Makes it more crazy. The musical sequences is eye rolling stupid. It literally takes up majority of the films running time. It was best to cut those sequences and keep the main plot focused.Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga are great but there performances are wasted in a script that does not build to any development.

Lady Gaga's performance as Harley Quinn lacks conviction-she plays more of a version of herself than the complex, chaotic character fans expect. Her chemistry with the Joker feels off, as the power dynamic between them is reversed. Instead of Harley being obsessed with the Joker, it feels like the Joker is the one clinging to her, which makes DC's most iconic villain look weak and unthreatening. This portrayal softens the Joker into a shadow of the menacing figure he's meant to be, leaving fans missing Margot Robbie's far more engaging and authentic Harley Quinn.\",\n",

The direction is as listless as the plot, with scenes dragged out beyond reason and no urgency or intensity to the story. Gotham isn't menacing or dark-it's just any old city, stripped of the gritty, malignant personality that usually defines it. Watching, I immediately wished Heath Ledger's Joker could burst onto the screen to breathe life into this lackluster version.Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga put in the work, but even their solid performances can't save the film from itself. The few bursts of action were teased in the trailer, so don't expect anything fresh. It's as if the director decided to turn Joker into a two-hour waiting room with mood music. It's the cinematic equivalent of watching paint dry. Don't waste your time, see The Substance to be mesmerized by Demi, or Strange Darling for a bit of sadistic fun.\",\n",

The style neither fits in the overall lore nor does it do the weak story any good, it went straight strongly annoying after the third song. Regarding the story the script is super weak and without spoiling any big parts (wouldn\\'t be a loss though), it mashes all the good the prequel has build up directly in the dirt.

It does not emphasise on the key points of the first movie. Seems like they just took the whole cast of the first movie while adding Gaga and waiting for the fans to take the bait, ignoring the weak scenario.Unfortunately the amazing cinematography is not enough to save a bad written film.

       "    'Review': 'Arthur Fleck was a harrowing character study, a one-man show capturing Arthur Fleck\\'s transformation into the Joker. Its gritty realism and psychological depth were its selling points. Todd Phillips\\' sequel, however, strayed from this formula, losing the original\\'s essence. Where \"Joker\" was intimate and raw, \"Joker 2\" felt like it was reaching for spectacle, diluting the powerful singular focus of its predecessor. Introduced into this delicate formula was Lady Gaga. While a talented performer, her inclusion altered the dynamics significantly. Instead of blending seamlessly into the dark tapestry of Gotham, her presence felt somewhat disjointed. Her portrayal, possibly a nod to her musical prowess, clashed with the tone set by Joaquin Phoenix\\'s Arthur. This not only distracted from the narrative but also undermined the gritty realism that made the first film so impactful. The seamless storytelling of \"Joker\" was lost in the sequel. Todd Phillips seemed to aim for a broader narrative scope, yet this choice backfired. The tight, introspective focus of Arthur\\'s world expanded, but not in a way that added depth or coherence. Instead, it felt fragmented, as if multiple storylines were vying for attention without a clear sense of direction.Dilution of Themes: \"Joker\" tackled themes of mental illness and societal neglect with precision. \"Joker 2,\" however, wavered in its thematic focus. The powerful undercurrents of the original were replaced with more convoluted, less impactful messages, diluting the emotional and psychological resonance that had captivated audiences initially.The tonal consistency of \"Joker\" was one of its strengths. The sequel, however, struggled to maintain this, oscillating between its dark roots and a more theatrical, almost operatic presentation. This shift created a dissonance that was jarring for viewers expecting a continuation of the first film\\'s somber realism. In essence, while attempting to expand the universe of \"Joker,\" Todd Phillips lost sight of the intimate, character-driven narrative that made the first film a success. Lady Gaga\\'s performance, though not without merit, contributed to this departure, further distancing \"Joker 2\" from the original\\'s raw, unfiltered portrayal of Arthur Fleck\\'s descent into madness. The result was a film that, despite its ambitions, fell short of the bar set by its predecessor.',\n",

The singing (and there was A LOT of singing) came at really annoying points when you would much rather a storyline/charscters being developed instead. To be fair, Joaquin Phoenix was excellent as usual but I was hoping that his character would develop more than it did. In fact, nothing much actually happened in the film and I started to feel quite bored in many parts, especially the singing bits. Towards the end I was willing the film to end just because nothing had really happened for over 2 hours apart from about 15 (boring) songs. By the time the end twist came I felt so bored that I didn't really care what happened and it didn't seem shocking or exciting. I was just glad to leave the cinema!

The entire movie feels written around having Lady Gaga sing as much as possible, even in the scenes she's not in.Phoenix's acting got a downgrade, he feels bored and out of it the entire film, we could argue the character calls for that, but it is, most likely, the actor just not being comfortable playing the Joker anymore (for PC reasons).There was a single, beautifully acted and profound scene, and it was just a call back to the first movie.

It might have worked to some degree if it wasn\\'t such a prominent part of the movie and if the rest of the movie had more to offer, but putting a legal procedural that did a lot of rehashing of the first movie around the musical fell flat and just didn\\'t entertain.Just an all-around disjointed flop and to be clear, none of that is on Joaquin Phoenix or Lady Gaga who are both talented actors and do the best they can with the material. It\\'s 100% on the writers and producers who, in the name of boldness(?) managed to follow up a great movie with one of the worst sequels ever.Sad and disappointed for what could have been.',\n",

Phoenix once again proves his depth as an actor, embodying the chaotic, tortured psyche of Arthur Fleck with precision. Lady Gaga brings intensity to her role, and their chemistry is palpable. However, despite the strong acting, the film falters significantly in other areas.The story lacks coherence and feels disconnected from the foundation built in the first Joker film. The narrative seems to meander without clear direction, relying too much on spectacle and musical numbers rather than meaningful plot development. What could have been a deep dive into shared psychosis or a compelling exploration of two fractured minds instead becomes muddled and overly abstract.Additionally, the movie drags on far too long, with many scenes feeling stretched beyond necessity. This pacing issue, combined with a disjointed story, makes it a slog to get through. While the performances keep it from being a total failure, Joker: Folie à Deux ultimately feels like a missed opportunity, weighed down by its own ambition.',\n",

Trying to make a character like Arthur Fleck sympathetic to the point of being an anti-hero is questionable story telling at best. He's ill and was let down by poor healthcare but that's more about how terrible the U. S. is about that sort of thing, not indicative to how a society(tm) let him down. Not having accountability means you're not a good person.Anyway, I don't want to really give anything away but I found this to be very boring and overstuffed with nonsense.

How they came to some of the 'creative' decisions they did, can only have been through some kind of shared madness.This film failed on so many fronts. Joaquin Phoenix performed very well again and Gaga did OK too in that respect.Making it a musical though was just a stupid idea. I mean, it ain't exactly the fare of your typical Mamamia fan is it? What's the plan here: to make it into a stage show? If so, I'll be there for sure, on opening night: with a truck of rotten tomatoes. And Broadway shall become La Tomatina!At the start, you could kinda look past a couple of the songs as being momentary drifts into fantasy but before long, the pattern becomes apparent - that hackneyed lazy pattern - a tiny little plot development before... ah crap, I can feel another one coming - yep, repeated gratuitous pointless musical diversions that fail to progress the story or develop the characters but just serve to each add a few more minutes to the run-time.Even if we ignore the decision though, to hitch a farcical ride on the coat tails of LaLaLand, there were crimes that completely invalidate the worth of this movie, worst of which: writers broke canon so badly (I'm no comic book nerd fussing over details but these were no details) that this character simply was no longer Joker and Gaga's character really wasn't Harley Quinn.Joker, nemesis to Batman, is chaotic, frenetic, clever: crazy, yes but charismatic. But most of all, he is successful - an arch villain! The character in this movie lived and died without transcending 'sad loser' status. He certainly never came close to being an arch villain. He did a crime on TV, got famous and got caught - so what?Similarly his girlfriend was really just a saddo hybristophiliac - there was nothing brilliant about her, nothing special or 'beautifully twisted' she wasn't even particularly mental - just a little messed up, and a bit stupid.I'm not blaming the actors here, they played well but the characters were, all said and done, flimsy nobodies that bore no resemblance to their namesakes other than the most superficial of traits. Frankly, they were little more than stolen names.Thing is though, there were moments of opportunity, when it could all have been pulled back - when our doubt, that there was ever anything truly significant about these characters, could have been smashed, exploded, vaporised with a little twist in the plot. But no, it never came and in the end they were just a couple of insignificants who got their 15 minutes of fame in New York (Oops erm we mean Gotham, your honour) and faded away again.

Every time I got engaged, they'd start to brain-dead sing for 5 minutes and ruin the moment. Overdone and a movie killer.They are many ways they could've went with to make a good movie, and this was their best idea?Should've left the first one sequel-less. The ending was weird and lackluster. What the hell was that? I really wanted this to be at least decent, but nope. What a waste of time. 2+ hours of nothingness.If you enjoyed Joker then sadly you won't enjoy Joker: Folie à Deux. Don't watch it unless you get paid to do so :)\",\n",

And that's irritating to hear singing them in every 10 minutes. It's really disappointing how they make The Joker from best to worst. Wish I could get some more of that old Harley Quinn and Joker that I have been seeing from years, but that was nowhere near to that exotic and thriller duo we saw even into the cartoons, and also can't compare this movie to the first one. Joaquin phoenix was the main character of Joker, but In this it's all about Singing contest for Lady Gaga..\",\n",

The first Joker film was a masterpiece and one of my favorite films ever. But unfortunately, the scenes were ruined by musical performances, which just felt strange for this type of movie. I missed more acting, more dialogue. Joaquin Phoenix, as always, was absolutely fantastic in the role of Joker, and his acting was what lifted the movie. Lady Gaga actually did really well too, but it felt like the director had decided that because she was in it, everything had to be about singing. Lady Gaga doesn't need song and music; she is a really fine actress. So, all in all, I'm just super disappointed with this movie and had expected something entirely different.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"If Joker 2 was meant to expand on the tortured psyche of Arthur Fleck, it succeeded only in expanding my boredom. What made the first film so intriguing-the slow descent into madness-was replaced with a frantic, disjointed attempt to outdo its predecessor without any real sense of direction. Fleck's evolution (or lack thereof) feels more like a series of erratic, isolated scenes than a cohesive narrative.The film struggles to find its tone, oscillating between forced social commentary and a carnival of absurdity, leaving neither thought-provoking nor entertaining moments to cling to. It's as if the filmmakers believed that more chaos automatically equals more depth, but instead, it comes off as empty spectacle with none of the philosophical grit that made the original resonate. The character development was shallow, almost as if they hoped we wouldn't notice the lack of story under the avalanche of neon-lit chaos and ominous laughs.Joaquin Phoenix, ever the committed actor, did his best, but even his performance couldn't save a script that feels more like a checklist of provocations than an actual journey. Joker 2 is a poor imitation of its own predecessor, like trying to laugh at the same joke twice-only this time, it falls flat, and you're left wondering why you ever found it funny in the first place.Verdict? Skip this punchline.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'I wonder what the insurance was like on this film since every...single...scene contained at least one person smoking. Chances are, they had to do multiple takes with each performer smoking a pack and a half to nail the scene...This felt like an obligation movie. Like Writer/Director Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix were contractedly (and very begrudgingly) HAD to do a follow-up to their Oscar-winning/billion-dollar original. \"Fine, since you\\'re gonna make us do this, let\\'s ruin it by making it a musical\" I could hear them say.Also, this felt like it could work either way. It could be brilliant by making the sequel into a musical or the musical scenes could bring down the whole movie. Spoiler: it\\'s the latter.I could see maybe ONE fantasy scene play out with a song and dance on an obvious soundstage. Maybe two. Most of the movie, it didn\\'t work. And neither did their voices.I love Lady Gaga and her music. Not this time. She was awful. And maybe Phoenix isn\\'t a born singer. I almost want to give him the benefit of the doubt since again, it felt like he was trying to sabotage the film. He was even worse with his voice.What did work for me was the transition from depressed clown to slowly getting a smile on his face due to the introduction of Gaga\\'s Harley Quinn. I pretty much loved watching that spark grow. While this was nowhere at all entertaining as the entirety of the first movie, at least that was something to grasp onto during this disaster.Can\\'t wait to hear someone ask if you needed to see the 2019\\'s Joker. Well, you should anyways because that was 10x better. But, necessary? Not sure. They bring that movie up and its events as much as you see someone light up a cigarette. Again, that\\'s every scene.So, if you were to take away the musical segments, the smoking and the references to Part One, this would be 22 minutes, max. What would be left is those awesome character developing scenes of Joker getting life back into his chuckles.It\\'s easy to hate on this movie for making the daring, albeit terrible, choice of switching subgenres and making this a musical out of nowhere. If the songs were good, memorable or were sung well, I could easily forgive this decision. I left the theatre roughly 60 minutes ago and I can remember one line from one of the songs: I am that Joker, or something like that. Okay, I guess all songs/segments were pretty forgettable.I definitely praised Phoenix for his take on the Joker in #1. While he was still only my third favorite live-action take (Heath Ledger will remain my #1 and Jack Nicholson\\'s a solid second place,) Gaga\\'s Harley Quinn was meh. I will ALWAYS prefer Margot Robbie\\'s version. I understand this version and that doesn\\'t make it great.Was this a waste of time? Did I try and cancel my tickets all week? Is this a worthy follow-up to that fantastic first movie?Why yes, yes and no. Skip it.***Final Thoughts: I will give this movie\\'s opening a total thumbs up. I\\'m not sure why THAT wasn\\'t the whole movie. I mean, if they could ruin the first by making this a bad musical, they could\\'ve certainly go all-in with that very fun opening.',\n",

I do not think a single was necessary. The first one was the best if they would've kept it at that I would've been able to keep it legacy, adding a sequel only devalued it. It's not that I don't appreciate God's voice or I'm not a fan. Maybe she should not have to sing in every movie like use your acting chops and just act girl you got it.

Traditional musicals use the songs to progress the plot and keep the story moving, the songs in this film just paused the movie like an irritating commercial break.The first movie resonated a bit too powerfully with the most dangerous segment of humankind, historically. The main message was one of revolution: subvert the dominant paradigm, kill the rich. But there was also an incredibly poignant affirmation for sufferers of trauma, especially that suffered by the movie\\'s protagonist, and all too real and common in our society even if massively under-acknowledged.I believe (and as always I must add that I could be wrong), that the studio execs, themselves somewhat wealthy, but especially pressured by the owners of capital who finance those studios (and nearly everything else), compelled a formerly unremarkable and less-than well-established director to disempower the sequel by rendering it a boring yet confusing musical inanity with the intention of at least capping the momentum of revolution and the empowerment of solidarity felt by the disenfranchised outcast represented by the Joker character in the first film.Serious question: who is this made for?

That's exactly how I felt, every single scene that you see Lady Gaga she's singing or she'll eventually sing! There's no story, there's no strong script! It's not a movie it feels more like a show case for Jacquin Phonix and Lady Gaga to show people how good they are and indeed Jacquin Phonix rocket it again! He's an incredible actor but that is not enough to keep people in the cinema if things make no sense! Even though there was a huge potential to take the viewers deeper.Shoutout to Lawrence Sher with, great visuals, great lightning!\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I came into this film expecting the reviews to be wrong. The first film was an excellent description of the joker and his complex mind and I felt that the producers could live up to the climax of maintaining the quality of the old film but even build on it and make it better.However after a dragged out 2 hours and 18 minutes,which could have been shortened by a lot, I realised that the film was a no going col-de-\\nsac of pointless songs and pointless characters. The role of Harley Quinn was portrayed and poorly played by lady gaga. The highly rated actor Joaquin Phoenix followed a poorly written script which although he played well it ultimately led to a poor film which I would not recommend.In conclusion I felt this film was a poor sequel due to the fact that Turning a film about a phychotic lunatic which made a great first film into a musical which went nowhere and proved to be heavily disappointing should never have been done to the joker series. Even though the joker is a laughing lunatic he does not sing his heart out in a film about him as the two films have parallel opposite genres which I feel shouldn't be done\\nI would not recommend this film for any Joker lovers who expect this to be good and also cannot stress enough to people to not go into this movie expecting it to be good as it will be drastically disappointing to you.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"For the love of God, whatever you do, do not see this movie.I can't believe how much nothing happened. There was no action, no violence, no arc, no character development, no point, and no reason to have watched it. I'm mad at myself for contributing to its box office.As I got deeper into the movie, I started to think they must be building to something huge and cathartic, but I can't stress enough when reviewing this just how much of literally nothing is going on. If you can imagine Phoenix and Gaga standing in a dim room and singing under their breath to each other, you'll pretty much have the whole experience.I don't know how Todd Phillips' brain works, so I can't say whether my suspicion that he is just messing with the audience is accurate or not. But it definitely feels that way as the movie ploddingly lumbers up to the verge of having something happen, only for it to veer off into monotony.And frankly, even calling it monotonous is a compliment because there's certainly an argument to be made that the movie lacks even a mono-tone. Unless you count deliberate boredom as a tone.If an argument could be made that the last movie really didn't have anything to do with the Joker, this movie settles that issue definitively. You could take any movie, slap the word Joker on it and put some makeup onto the star's face, and it would have just as much claim to being a Joker movie as this does. If you slapped some clown makeup onto Tom Cruise and called the movie Top Gun: The Joker, it would be just as valid.The only reason it got three stars out of me is because everyone is a good actor, doing the best they can with a painful lack of material.\",\n",

Looks like he starved himself unless it is movie magic. The description of jukebox musical is appropriate as there is singing throughout and full numbers not just snippets. Kept waiting for action but it was far and few between and mostly flashbacks to the first Joker. Gaga was brought in for the singing as her acting is B movie quality and if you don't like her singing the movie becomes torture. It would have been more interesting if they did more with her character with a different actress. This ended up being more of a prison movie than anything else. Save your money.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux is perhaps the most textbook example to date of a film being less than the sum of its parts; it dances with very compelling ideas and themes, it bolsters incredible performances by an all-star cast, it is just as hauntingly beautiful in its cinematography as the first film, and the basic story premise is a compelling iteration upon the prior film at first glance. But alas, the ultimate assembly of this sequel in the form of the film we end up watching could not be any more disappointing and misguided. This movie is such a plodding, dull, unengaging, and boring viewing experience that lacks even the most basic fundamentals of cinematic pulse.I am in awe that a film of this scale with so much talent behind it could be squandered so severely. Part of me begins to wander if a superior edit of this film could exist, but it is useless to dwell on such what-ifs when the director himself affirms that this version of the film is his complete vision. An oddly large number of viewers do applaud this film based solely on the merit of what it attempts instead of what it actually achieves; to that, I say, if films were weighed based on their intent instead of their execution, then Tommy Wiseau's The Room would be an objective masterpiece instead of an ironic one.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker 2 was one of my most anticipated movies this year. The previews looked fantastic and thought this had the potential to be the best movie of the year. After seeing it today, it is battling Last Jedi for worst movie of all time.What a miserable film. It's basically watching a guy get treated terribly by everyone and I mean everyone. This film tries to punish him for his crimes to the point where the film itself is punishing him. It's like taking your least favorite toy and giving it nothing because you somehow hate it so much.The previews never advertise that it's a musical. Anything that resembles a musical is shown them on stage but nothing that will help you to that conclusion. I mean, I heard people walking out of the theater that they didn't know it was a musical.Some of these musical numbers are hit and miss, mostly miss and thankfully they are mostly performed in Joker's head. However, I start to realize the lack of story and these musical numbers are not only out of place and unnecessary, they are merely there to pad out the runtime.As usual, The Phoenix Brother delivered well for his 50 million dollar paycheck along with Lady Gaga. Brenden Gleason as the warden is also wonderful. The movie was also shot well. These are the only positives I can think of that kept me from scoring this film a one.It's just that it felt like a film that simply exists because the studio wanted another sequel this creating a Matrix Resurrections effect where everyone involved was either to spiteful to make this or too fearful of its target audience.\",\n",

To a truly tone-deaf musical which completely destroys the dark and sombre tones built by the rest of the plot.I understand the intention of using the musical scenes as a motif for Arthur's further descent into psychosis, but they feel so out of place that they mostly serve to break the immersion of the audience.The decision for the sequel to a dark, gritty, and depressing psychological thriller about a mentally ill man (and the society that failed to care for him, though the second never addressed this to the same degree as the first) to feature energetic big band musical sequences is so truly BAFFLING to me.I can't help but be frustrated by this movie. It feels like every time I was invested in a scene, the tension that was carefully built was immediately trainwrecked as Phoenix or Gaga spontaneously broke out into song, and I feel like hurling the closest object at the screen out of annoyance as I'm immediately brought out of Arthur's plight.I wish we could've seen this movie without these scenes.\",\n",

It lacked the depth and nuance you'd expect from a film that is supposed to delve into the psyche of such an iconic character. Instead, it felt like a waste of time, with scenes that dragged on without any real impact or significance. The whole movie lacked substance, and by the end, it felt like nothing had been achieved.

Some of the songs did make an impact but 80% of the music sequences just felt out of place and really paused any momentum the movie had, which wasn't much.Nothing really happened in this movie, it kind of felt like an unnecessary, added chapter to the end of the first movie, dragged out to a feature length film. I'm not sure who this movie was made for as it definitely wasn't made for the fans of the original movie, but I can't imagine it makes any new fans happy either.Anyone coming for Lady Gaga will be disappointed that she is not used very well or often and her story leads nowhere. Anyone coming for Joker (while an amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix) will also be disappointed with how his story unfolds as he doesn't have any agency in his own film and he is made out to be the joke of the film.The movie is visually beautiful and the performances by Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix are great, and the movie does have some really funny moments but these are not enough to save the film. I would not watch this movie a second time even though I have watched the first film multiple times.\",\n",

Such a disappointment compared to the previous Joker.This by itself was perhaps innovative from the perspective of some viewers and certainly worked in movies like Sweeny Todd with Johnny Depp. From my standpoint, it was an absolutely misguided decision that was worsened by Lady Gaga. Her portraying Harley Queen did just not appear believable. A popstar with one of the most notable voices in the world singing in an asylum choir? She did not have anything crazy about her except for trying to bring the Joker out of Arthur Fleck. Poor casting choice, there would have been so many alternatives. And the singing could have been cut short by almost every song. I strongly hope that the director never gives us a Batman movie, I already have nightmares of the Dark Night dancing like a Ballerina.Fair play to the display of personality disorders. The theme from the cartoon in the beginning was prevalent throughout the movie.The scenes in tue courtroom were poorly made compared to other decade-old but legendary pieces of movie history like 12 angry men.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker was a great movie. A one-off, almost art-house film that really didn\\'t need a sequel. I suppose you can admire director Todd Phillips for trying something different. It\\'s a prison/courtroom drama with a speck of (bad) romance. Oh, and it\\'s a musical too! It\\'s a bold move... But unfortunately, this uninspiring, tedious disaster of a movie just doesn\\'t work.What\\'s good about it? The performances from the lead and supporting cast are Oscar worthy. Erm, there\\'s also some nice cinematography but that\\'s about it. More scenes with Steve Coogan next time please!What\\'s wrong with it? Oh man, everything! The first movie was about Arthur Fleck\\'s tragic, tormented and disturbing journey of him becoming the Joker. This sequel has Joaquin Phoenix gone back to being Arthur Fleck, moping around in prison, only fantasising about being in full Joker make-up & suit while performing meaningless songs with his new girlfriend, Harley Quinn. Those of you who were expecting a full-on musical will be disappointed. The songs feel like an afterthought that was shoehorned in at the last minute. Maybe the film-makers realised what an absolute turkey this was going to be and thought \\'I know what to do, Lady Gaga can sing! Let\\'s give her some songs and get Joaquin Phoenix to mumble along with her. What a brilliant idea!\\' How about no! This is a terrible idea and it fails miserably. It only slows the pace of this already unentertaining and depressing movie and makes you worry about what dreadful ideas are possibly on the table for \\'The Batman Part II\\'.\"Let\\'s give the people what they want.\"\\nLady Gaga/Harley QuinnWell, it ain\\'t this dull, empty and lifeless monstrosity.

       "    'Review': 'Oh , where do I begin? Apparently, someone thought what the gritty, psychologically intense original *Joker* really needed was to become a *musical*. And not just any musical, but one that hijacks the plot halfway through, leaving you wondering if you walked into the wrong movie. Yes, some of the songs were catchy, but the strong plot from the first half takes a nosedive right when the singing starts. It\\'s like the film loses its way, trading tension and depth for showy dance numbers.Joaquin Phoenix, bless his soul, gives another outstanding performance as Arthur Fleck, showing consistency with the first film, even as the writing lets him down. But no amount of brooding intensity can save a character from poor writing and an overlong runtime. Lady Gaga? She was good, but with so little screen time, she never quite gets the chance to fully shine. It\\'s like they brought her in, had her belt out a couple of songs, and then decided to sideline her.And let\\'s talk about pacing. If the first half of the film has you intrigued, the second half might just have you falling asleep. This movie is unnecessarily long, stretching its thin plot to painful lengths. But, hey, at least the cinematography is gorgeous, right? The dark, haunting visuals and metaphors are almost enough to make you forgive the messy story. Almost.In the end, *Folie à Deux* is a muddled blend of musical missteps and slow pacing. Watch it at home if you must, but don\\'t waste your money on a theater ticket. After sitting through two-plus hours of this, I couldn\\'t help but think, \"At this point, we\\'re the clowns.\" But hey, you get what you deserve.',\n",

There is good production value, with great cinematography that makes the film pop, especially during some of the musical scenes, and Phoenix, along with Gaga, did good with the poor material that they had.However, the whole movie is a dull, tedious slog that hates it's own existence that fails in almost every way possible. It fails as a musical, with almost all of the musical numbers feeling dull and lifeless, and barely do anything to move the story forward, having no flow with the rest of the movie. It fails as a courtroom drama, as it fails to provide interesting perspectives on the dilemma the film focuses on, resulting in a shallow court case that's overly drawn.It fails as a sequel, spending so much of the runtime to tearing down the first movie that it fails to do anything else meaningful and new. And worst of all, it simply fails as a movie by having cynicism towards it's own existence and it's audience, resulting in an overly long whimper of a movie.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux had high expectations following the critically acclaimed original, but unfortunately, this sequel falls short in almost every regard. The film attempts to delve deeper into Arthur Fleck's psyche, but what was once a nuanced exploration of mental illness now feels more like a disjointed, overindulgent spectacle.First and foremost, the inclusion of musical numbers-an unexpected choice-ends up feeling jarring and out of place, disrupting the tone established by its predecessor. What worked for other genre-bending films ends up feeling forced here, as the contrast between Fleck's psychological descent and these surreal scenes is more confusing than compelling. Even with the talents of Lady Gaga, her portrayal of Harley Quinn feels underdeveloped, almost like an afterthought in the script, serving more as a caricature than a fully realized character.The film's pacing is another significant issue. It drags through long, meandering sequences that neither advance the plot nor build tension. While the original Joker was intense and engaging, Folie à Deux struggles to maintain momentum, frequently losing focus with repetitive scenes that try too hard to be provocative without saying anything new.Lastly, Joaquin Phoenix's performance-while still impressive-seems constrained by a script that doesn't know what to do with him. What should have been a deeper dive into his disturbed worldview instead becomes a rehash of the same ideas, leaving the character feeling stagnant and robbed of the complexity that made him compelling in the first place.Overall, Joker: Folie à Deux is a disappointment. It's a film that tries to blend genres and push boundaries but ends up feeling like a chaotic mishmash that's neither gripping nor thought-provoking. Fans of the original will likely be let down by this sequel that fails to justify its existence.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"This might be one of the hardest movie reviews I've written. I was shocked when every review for Joker: Folie à Deux came out negative, but after seeing it, I can understand why-especially when it comes to the ending.To start, every other part of this sequel is decent, although it's a bit of a departure, taking on the feel of a love story musical. While Joaquin Phoenix delivers a compelling performance, and Lady Gaga might just be the best Harley Quinn I've ever seen, the movie's heavy emphasis on dreamlike, musical sequences between Phoenix and Gaga caught a lot of people off guard. They spend a significant part of the film singing to each other, creating a surreal and often romantic atmosphere that's not what many fans were expecting.But while I didn't mind the musical direction, the film's real downfall lies in its brutal ending. Without giving anything away, it's extremely graphic and feels so unnecessarily gruesome that it leaves a bad taste after an otherwise decent experience. It's uncomfortable to watch and definitely not suitable for younger viewers.If you're planning to see Joker: Folie à Deux, go in with an open mind. There's a lot to appreciate, especially in the acting and musical approach, but prepare yourself-the ending is intense and could be off-putting for some.\",\n",

The worst thing about the sequel is how bored you are while watching everything that was and anything that could\\'ve been play out in front of you.The opening animation tells us, in Peter Pan fashion, that Arthur Fleck is part himself and part Joker. The rest of the film is tries to answer the question if Joker is schizophrenic or not, ultimately deciding whether he will receive the death penalty for the five murders he committed in the previous movie. Or is it to find out if he\\'s guilty? Surely he doesn\\'t have a chance at being freed. Does he plan on escaping prison? In the meantime he develops a romance with not Harley Quinn. Is this believable? No. But it has to happen to ultimately lead us...who knows.

But this is to be expected and only serviced me to not go completely insane myself with the meandering story that never evolved until the tedious ending which only serves to not wrap up anything, but proves there was nothing to wrap up other than telling you that the most honest part of the film was the first three minutes.

Doesn't go more than 15 minutes without breaking into song and dance the entire film. I have no clue why anyone thought it would be a good idea to make this into a musical. It tries to be edgy and alternative and as a result the movie is a steaming pile of rubbish. My favorite part was joker told lady gaga to stop singing. It was like he finally realized how God damned annoying it was. If I could choose to erase this movie from my memory, so I had only seen the first one I would.Wouldn't recommend this to anyone that is not also a fan of high-school musical.\",\n",

       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is the highly anticipated sequel to the critically acclaimed \"Joker\" (2019), directed by Todd Phillips. This film continues the story of one of the most iconic villains in comic book history, delving deeper into the psyche of its central character while exploring new themes and narratives.One of the standout features of \"Folie à Deux\" is its ambitious approach to storytelling. However, in my opinion, the plot feels underdeveloped; it remains in the background and fails to be either solid or particularly engaging. While the film expands on the psychological complexity, the end result does not fully capture attention as one might expect.Visually, the film maintains the striking aesthetic that characterized its predecessor. The work of cinematographer Lawrence Sher, combined with Phillips\\' direction, creates a dark and immersive atmosphere that enhances the emotional weight of the narrative. However, another aspect that negatively impacted my experience is the presence of musical elements. The stylistic shift from the first \"Joker\" is too evident, and these musical moments feel too abrupt and, at times, irritating.The performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga are consistently top-notch and undoubtedly represent a strong point of the film. Phoenix, reprising his iconic role, delivers a complex mix of vulnerability and intensity, while Gaga adds a new dimension to the story. Despite this, I feel the film is a missed opportunity; the performances of the two actors, while excellent, cannot support a plot that, in my view, fails to shine as it should.In summary, \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" positions itself as a thought-provoking exploration of its characters and the societal constructs surrounding them, but not without flaws. With its strong thematic elements and captivating performances, the film is poised to engage both fans of the original and newcomers, though I personally found it less compelling. While maintaining the profound psychological intensity of its predecessor, this sequel promises to take the story in new and unexpected directions, but it may not meet everyone\\'s expectations.',\n",

There are a few satisfactory moments that will likely resonate with Joker fans but for the most part the villain that is quite frankly larger than life and appreciated globally is severely underwhelmed and completely neglected. The only thing that had me on the edge of my seat was the unrewarded anticipation of the actual Joker's arrival. The character that is capable of unfathomable cruelty and maniacal ingenious is not present in this film.. Sad outing for one of the greatest. The biggest let down is that feature films for these type of characters are rarely produced, so to have wasted the opportunity is nothing but heartbreaking. Now that all the Joker character disappointment is assessed I will say the music, cinematography, and acting are top notch which can be expected from such a talented team.\",\n",

Where the original film captivated audiences with its gritty realism and compelling character study, this installment feels like a hollow attempt to recapture that magic.The decision to incorporate musical elements was baffling. Instead of adding depth to Arthur Fleck's fractured psyche, the sudden shifts into musical sequences feel jarring and out of place, detracting from the tension and atmosphere that defined the first film. Rather than serving as an artistic expression of his descent into madness, the choreography and singing come off as a disjointed spectacle that undermines the dark tone.Overall, Joker: Folie à Deux feels like a disappointing follow-up that tries to push boundaries but ends up lost in its own ambition. It's a film that confuses spectacle for substance and risks diluting the impact of the original by stretching a character study into something it was never meant to be: a spectacle of chaotic musical numbers and shallow melodrama.\",\n",

Instead of delivering the depth expected from a Joker movie, it felt more like a musical. It was a major letdown for Joker fans. They utterly dismantled the Joker character. The story was directionless and felt meaningless. Throughout the movie, I kept waiting for something to happen that would redeem the terrible plot, but nothing ever did. It left me deeply disappointed.The REAL JOKER character holds so much potential for deeper exploration. There are countless incredible films that could be made based on his complex life. Unfortunately, this film seemed more focused on profit, which led to its downfall. They reduced Joker to a filthy, pathetic man whose only hope lies in seeking sex and attention, and they dared to call that love. Seriously?!That said, Joaquin Phoenix's performance was outstanding, particularly in certain scenes, but even his brilliance couldn't save this film. At times, the music gave me goosebumps, just like in the first Joker movie, but it wasn't enough to redeem the overall experience.As for Lady Gaga's portrayal of Harley Quinn, her costume didn't really capture the essence of the character. Her acting was decent, but nothing memorable or particularly special.\",\n",

       "    'Review': '*\"Joker: Folie à Deux\"* may claim to explore the dynamic between Arthur Fleck and Lee, but in reality, it\\'s more of a one-man show. Lee\\'s character, who could have provided a compelling counterbalance, is completely sidelined in the second half as the film descends into an oddly misplaced courtroom drama. Any potential for a rich exploration of their relationship evaporates as the focus shifts back to Arthur\\'s repetitive internal conflict. The film flirts with the idea of duality-whether Arthur\\'s Joker persona is distinct from him-but exhausts the question long before the credits roll.The musical numbers are jarring and contribute little, with many sounding so similar that they only serve to drag the already sluggish narrative. They halt any momentum, leaving viewers unsure whether the film is a romance, a musical, a courtroom drama, or a critique of the justice system. In trying to be all of these things, it ends up being none, lacking any true sense of direction or purpose.Lee\\'s character could have added a fresh dynamic, but the script doesn\\'t give her the space to develop. Instead, she fades into the background, almost as an afterthought. By the end of its bloated runtime, the film leaves viewers questioning why it exists at all. Was it born from the massive success of the 2019 *Joker*? Possibly. But if that\\'s the case, this film takes every opportunity to squander that goodwill.A cast of incredibly talented actors, visually stunning set designs, and an atmospheric score are wasted in a story that has little to say. Todd Phillips seems determined to dismantle everything that made the original Joker compelling, leaving audiences wondering if this sequel\\'s purpose was merely to prove that lightning doesn\\'t strike the same place twice.',\n",

Instead of turning him into a cartoon villain, no pun intended, it instead portrayed him as a deeply disturbed individual who was given a very raw deal in life and how that put him into a spiral of violence and madness. This movie had an excellent opportunity to continue this progression and turn him into the diabolical Batman arch-enemy we all know he should be.But instead they made the asinine choice to turn it into a ehr... musical? For me such a choice could be only for one reason and that is to revert the expectations of the original fans and turn this movie into a joke, again no pun intended. Also, ignoring the boring musical parts, the movie just feels pointless. Half of the movie in an insane asylum and the other part in courtroom. Going back and forth trying to explain what he did in the first movie. But for what? We already saw the first movie and many felt it put Arthur Fleck into the path where he transcends his mortal form and become the immortal Joker. But this movie takes a u-turn and turns him back into Arthur Fleck and then ends his path in a brutal fashion.This is a terrible movie which seems to hate its prequel and want to undo it. So I recommend skipping this movie entirely and just re-watch Joker 1 and use your imagination on how he transformed into Joker.

       "    'Review': \"Okay, so I'm gonna get this straight, I never was particularly fond of this iteration of the Joker. Mostly because I'm a huge comic nerd and I can tell that the first movie wasn't so much of a deconstruction of the Joker character, but more so the exploration of a mentally ill man who just happens to refer to himself eventually as the Joker. Arthur Fleck is a deviation of the typical character and it's clear the Joker name was slapped on to get butts into seats. Beyond the name, it takes a lot of element from works evocative of Scorsese and smashes them down into a surprisingly basic and even somewhat generic story about someone falling into mental illness. Phoenix's performance is really what elevates the first film.That being said, at least they tried something here. Not only is Phoenix's performance and Ladu Gaga's vocals the only saving grace, there are far more glaring flaws this time around. The pacing feels absolutely mishandled, Lady Gaga's performance(and her overall character as Harley Quinn) falls extremely flat, albeit Gaga can sing her heart out. The film feels extremely contrived, ESPECIALLY towards the conclusion(for those who seen it, they know what I'm talking about) and for as much as the first movie tries to raise some decent talking points with some cohesion, this sequel in comparison feels like it isn't sure what it's trying to convey. So much potential, but the execution leaves so much to be desired. Not what I would've wanted after waiting five years for a follow-up on Arthur's story, but ultimately not shocked. Once I heard about it being a musical and Lady Gaga(excellent singer but mediocre actress) being the lead, my optimism flew out the window. The irony is that like the first movie, the title is meant to attract audiences and as you can tell from Gaga's casting, they were really trying to pull out the stops this time. But I have a gut feeling this sequel is not going to have the same impact on any level like it's predecessor did. 3 out of 10. Can't rate this any higher.\",\n",

Then something happened, ... and everything was already over!Acting was fine, but there was not much of a story, at least none that could not have been put into less then 40 minutes of movie time, and then move on with a story that probably everyone was waiting for.What a waste of time! I should have checked IMDb before spending money on the movie ticket, in fact I should have listened to my Spotify playlist instead.\",\n",

The only reason I even gave 3 stars were because the actors, not the movie! I won't spoil it for everyone who hasn't seen it but please do yourself and all of us a favor and DO NOT try to make a follow up, a comeback, a series, anything!

The director, in order to explain the nature of the Joker, ended up massacring one of the greatest characters ever seen in popular culture. Officially, from now on, the Joker is nothing more than a pathetic weakling who admits that he should have listened to the system. The character of the Joker as we know it after this film seems to have gone forever. Too bad.Anyway, the actors did a great job. Considering her lifestyle, Lady Gaga fits the character of Harvey very well. I think that all the burden of failure unfortunately lies on the director's back.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker Folie à Deux is a prime example of how a highly anticipated sequel can fall drastically short of expectations. While the film boasts impressive performances and a commendable musical score, it ultimately fails to deliver a coherent and engaging narrative.The Good (and it\\'s mildly good)Lady Gaga delivers a standout performance, showcasing her versatility as an actressThe musical elements are well-executed and add a unique flavor to the filmThe overall production value and cinematography are of high qualityThe Bad (and it\\'s really bad)The plot feels disjointed and lacks a clear directionThe film strays too far from the source, feeling more like a bait-and-switch than a true Joker storyThe movie feels like a missed opportunity. Instead of delving deeper into the Joker\\'s psyche while following the arc of the known story (for example how the Joker becomes more and more the known sociopath who perpetrates crime on a mass level) the film opts for a confusing and ultimately unsatisfying direction. It\\'s as if the creators used the Joker\\'s name solely for marketing purposes, much like the infamous \"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.\" The film\\'s departure from the established Joker lore is particularly frustrating. Fans hoping for an exploration of the character\\'s complex psychology and backstory will be sorely disappointed. What could have been a fascinating character study instead feels like a hollow travesty. While the musical aspects and performances are praiseworthy, they\\'re not enough to salvage the film\\'s fundamental flaws. It\\'s a shame to see such talent and potential squandered on a lackluster script and misguided creative decisions. Save your time and money for a more worthwhile cinematic experience.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker 2 revolves around the viewer getting an expanded look, into Arthur's disturbed an broken mind, while being incarcerated in prison, convicted of the five murders, we saw in the previous film.It's not often I go to the theatre to watch a film, but I found it fitting to go watch this, as the last time I went to the theatre was to watch the first one.I had beforehand decided to not watch any trailers and read as few reviews as I possible could, so I could get the full experience and not come in with an expectation.In hindsight I now wish I actually had, so I could have saved myself the $60 the two tickets cost.The film has issues - many issues.The first and probably the most obvious one, is the artistic detour the writers, producers and Todd Phillips in the direction chair took.I'm baffled about the how and why they decided it was a good idea, to turn the now franchise into a musical. And at that point, not even a great one. While I can see it was an attempt to capture Arthur's broken mind, it could have been done in so many other ways, which could have worded a lot better.What we were presented with, is a prolonged Lady Gaga Music Video.The character development is lazy and quite frankly both Arthur and Lee come off as terribly boring. Lee barely has much to say in the film, and the lines she does have doesn't really offer much to the development of the characters over all.When it comes to Arthur, there is very little of him left in him. While I can accept that as a starting point of the film, had it revolved in him going back to his prime time as the Joker, it just never happened. Through out the film, we are met by the same empty and boring character with none to very little development.When Arthur finally has the chance to shine, it's like seeing a totally different person, besides Arthur or the Joker.When it comes to the story and the setting, the movie lacks a lot of the gritty setting and suspension the first film had. In many ways what we were left with was boring and I sat through out the film waiting for something to happen, that just never came.There was way too many artistic freedoms taken in this film and I don't really find many of them a work of a genius.For now, I shall forget this movie exist and just enjoy, that we at least have the first one and it actually details Arthur's descending into The Joker.\",\n",

His lawyer Maryanne is trying to prove Arthur has dissociative identity disorder and Joker is his split personality in order to prove his mental illness. Harleen confesses her admiration of Joker to Arthur and how she relates to him the most. This leads to him falling in love with her while his trial begins. Maryanne wants to prove Arthur Fleck as innocent whereas Harleen wants Arthur to embrace Joker completely. What happens when Arthur tries to stop his shadow aka Joker, forms rest of the story.Todd Phillips and team have come up with a thin storyline to be stretched into sequel and turning this into a musical helps in increasing the runtime. However, the world of Arthur\\'s fantasy and his reality, though filmed well, doesn\\'t really clash together in the way intended. Lady Gaga was born to play Harleen Lee Quinzel but sadly her role is poorly written. Credit goes to Lady Gaga for elevating her character. Joaquin Phoenix continues his act from Joker and though he looked a bit less convincing in the songs, he made it up in the key scenes. It was the messed up final act and that \"climax\", that derailed the film entirely. With a threadbare storyline, it was always going to be an uphill task to match the far superior prequel.',\n",

I felt bad for him to work here. Hopefully he got his bag cause he's not the one to blame for this mess.Todd Phillips you created a masterpiece in 2019 and sabotaged it on purpose. You got your pay check and could've at least tried to make a good sequel like a Joker & Harley Bonnie & Clyde movie or something. Joker 2 has no story, no development and gives me nothing for my money. It's one thing to punish Warner, but a horrible thing to do that to the people that actually pays for that. Warner still gets money for that so it makes no sense to f up this movie. I trusted you because of Old School, War Dogs & Joker, but this sequel puts DC's most popular character in the absolute worst spotlight ever and I'll never forgave you for that. Unlike others I don't think the musical aspect was an issue although it haltered the movie and overstretched it to find its pace.Joaquin PhoenixHit and miss actor. Fabulous work in the first movie and the only thing I can here blame him for is saying yes to this terrible movie.Lady Gaga\\nShe's not a good actress for me, but she really tried and was pushing to get something out of this movie.

With stars like Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, I was hoping for an intense and profound portrayal of the Joker-a character known for his dark, complex, and psychopathic nature.While Phoenix and Gaga give solid performances, the film falls flat in delivering the story we all wanted. Instead of diving deep into the Joker's twisted psyche, we're given an odd mix of musical numbers and dance sequences that feel out of place, often popping up every few minutes without any real purpose. The Joker's torment, his darkness, and his complexity-all of that is missing.What makes it worse is that we all know this isn't the *real* Joker from the comics or earlier films. But even with that freedom, the movie wastes the potential to explore the more psychological, chaotic side of the character. Instead, we're left with a shallow version of what could've been a gripping dive into madness.The supporting characters, like Harley Quinn (played by Gaga), are equally underserved. Instead of playing into their notorious, toxic dynamic, her character feels one-dimensional, with little depth to their connection. The lack of meaningful interaction between the Joker and figures like Murray Franklin or even Arkham inmates drains the story of any tension or intrigue.It's a real shame because, with the right direction, this could've easily been one of the best films of the year. Instead, it's a disappointment. Save yourself the time and money-this one doesn't live up to the hype.\",\n",

I kept waiting in anticipation thinking this must be building towards some big moment that unfortunately never arrives, and instead was left with nothing but disappointment as the movie ends on a worse note than it began.I was on the fence when I watched the trailer, but now having seen it I kind of wish I wouldn't have.

Like many, I was skeptical about turning the Joker story into a musical, though I was willing to give it a fair shot. Unfortunately, the film falls short in several key areas.The musical aspect, intended to give insight into the Joker's psyche, quickly becomes overdone and tedious. While the songs could have been an interesting way to explore the character's inner world, they focus almost exclusively on the love story between Joker and Harley Quinn, missing an opportunity to delve deeper into his madness. There's one brief moment-10-minutes in a scene (where the Joker also sings about something other than love)- that captures a glimpse of the eccentric madness from the first film. For that short stretch, the movie shows what it could have been, but it ultimately slips back into disappointment.The overuse of scenic shots, an excessive focus on a fictional trial that takes up a third of the movie, and the endless musical numbers make the film feel drawn out. By the end, I was eager for it to finish. Despite my best efforts to play devil's advocate, I left the theater completely aligned with the wave of criticism.The only real highlight is the performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, who fully commit to their roles as Gotham's infamous crime couple.

But here, all those criticisms are made a lot more valid. The way it tries to empathise and criticize its protagonist is so dumb, and it doesn't exactly seem like the same character from the first one the way a lot of decisions are made. Lady Gaga's character is written as a template serial killer lover and nothing more even though she tries her best. So, naming that character Harley Quinn is such a disservice considering the history of that character.A lot of the movie takes place in a courtroom and jail. In both of these areas, there are just a lot of things that don't make sense. The cops and lawyers in this movie say and do things that don't make any sense considering what they actually want from doing it. The Joker says a lot of things that amount to nothing while in the first movie, all of his rants and comedy had a cinematic purpose.Considering they went for a musical, the movie had a lot of chances to be a lot more than it is even with its nonsensical paper-thin plot but they don't commit to it. And ending the movie abruptly like that, when the previous scene would've been enough just to reduce the drama of that event is so dumb. I mean, this is supposed to be a musical and such a big thing is presented in such a bland way?The choice to be a musical and the ending are supposed to be the polarizing aspects of the movie. But I enjoyed the musical aspect and the ending being so bland is more of the issue than the choice to do that considering how the rest of the movie went. Overall, it's technically well-made but has a weak script. It should've been utterly boring if not for the atmosphere that it sets for the movie. Nonetheless, such a bad sequel.\",\n",

The first movie was not perfect but it is still good and it was my favourite movie of the 2019. However, this movie preferred to take all that and make a high school musical with the Joker and Lady Gaga. The main problem is not that the movie is a musical; the problem is the empty story with a slow rhythm that makes the movie feel like an eternity. Lady Gaga's perfomance is very lazy and boring like her character and Joaquin Phoenix seems zero interested in this movie. The music is very forgettable and the choreographies are poor and unexciting. Also, the worst part of this movie is the ending because it seems that the director wanted to mock his fans. This was my second disappointment of this year (the first was the crow )\",\n",

I'm confused if we even got any further than the first movie.It kinda felt like 40 small trailers stitched together.A shot here. Cut. Black screen. And a new shot there.

And it's okay but don't have what felt like an hour of bad singing.It kinda felt like watching a badly made Wes Anderson movie. The way that the movie gave room for these musical performances to take place in a different time and place. But these performances are not well connected enough to justify there relevance for the movie.There wasn't a lot of depths to the characters.But Phoenix was great.My first thought on my mind: it's nothing to celebrate.My conclusion is that I found more joy watching 65. And that's a movie about a man and a little girl who screams for the full duration of that movie.\",\n",

       "    'Review': '\"Joker 2\" is, in many ways, an unnecessary sequel that never should have existed, reflecting the greed of a Hollywood studio seeking awards and box-office profits. I entered the theater with low expectations and reluctance, despite loving the original, mainly due to the inclusion of musical numbers, which could easily fall flat as they don\\'t fit the tone. Surprisingly, the first hour entertained me, and I thought, \"Well, it\\'s not as good as the original, but it\\'s not as bad as I expected,\" even with the evident excess of songs. However, my optimism was misplaced as that initial positive impression quickly crumbled as the film dragged on without any clear direction.The movie stretches on to the point where it feels repetitive, with most scenes taking place in the prison and courtroom, locations that quickly become tiresome and lacking in visual or narrative innovation. There was nothing impactful, no personal drama that made me want to engage with the story. \"Joker 2\" stalls more than a poorly rolled joint that never lights as it should.Another major issue lies with the characters. The Joker, brilliantly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in the first film, appears here as a hollow version of himself. There is no emotional or psychological development that does justice to the character\\'s complexity. While the first film showcased a downward spiral culminating in violence and chaos, here, the Joker lacks life and purpose. He moves slowly, directionless, as if lost within the plot. For such an iconic character, this is unforgivable.Lady Gaga is an excellent actress and singer, but she didn\\'t convince me as Harley Quinn. The problem isn\\'t her talent, which is undeniable, but rather the writing surrounding her character, which fails to make her memorable. In my opinion, this is the worst portrayal of Harley Quinn, wasting her talent, especially considering what Lady Gaga is capable of.Technically, there\\'s nothing to criticize about \"Joker 2.\" The cinematography, art direction, and sound are all impeccable, which only makes it more frustrating that the film offers nothing new narratively and, worse, leads us nowhere. Ultimately, it feels like a parade of stylized scenes and cliched lines, designed for sharing on Tumblr.One last thing: the $200 million budget is a mystery. Where did all that money go? The film mostly takes place in the same settings, lacking significant action moments or special effects to justify such an investment. I got the impression that most of that budget went to Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga\\'s salaries because, honestly, there\\'s not much else to justify it.As for the musical moments I dreaded, I have to admit they turned out better than I expected, but that doesn\\'t mean they work well. They often feel forced, as if hastily inserted to give the film a different identity, but they end up disrupting the pace and, in many cases, making the experience even more tedious.In summary, \"Joker 2\" can be visually stunning and technically charming, but it\\'s ultimately a completely unnecessary and weak sequel. It adds nothing new to the universe that the first film so effectively built and stands as another example of a terrible continuation of a great film, much like \"American Psycho 2.\" Its existence, like the narrative it presents, simply lacks purpose.',\n",

I had no expectations on the film or plot.I thought even if this ends up being a court room musical (as ppl were claiming) - that tbh sounded great. I love musicals and broadway. I have (and loved) working at a real courthouse. This honestly sounded like a dream sequel.Despite this - The movie isn't bad, but it sure isn't good. The movie is a bit too pretentious for its own good. It also does Lady Gaga no favors. The music was not good, nor was it supposed to be.The plot isn't even awful, it's just so incredibly slow bc of the music. The music did not add a ton to the plot, and that is problematic. In the first film his delusions added to the plot. The singing added to the plot but by the 4th-5th-6th songs the point was beyond made. Cool this is what yall wanted? Then yah, expect to flop. And when ppl who love musicals still don't like it, ya know it's a true flop.The first movie will remain a standalone and a stellar one at that. I truly like the idea of what they were going for here but it just wasn't done well at all.Also, a film that purposely tries to piss ppl off isn't ever good for business. And yes, this is a business. I wouldn't pretend otherwise. It's okay to like this film. It's also okay to not like it. It's not bad. But it's also not great.\",\n",

The potential for greatness is there, buried somewhere in the concept, but it never fully materializes.I think the idea of focusing on a trial could have worked. In fact, it might have been better suited as a limited series, giving the narrative room to breathe and develop.

So lets use her singing talent to let her sing as much as possible...The first hour, the movie builds up and could be a great intro to finally action from the Joker. The first hour of the movie, i would give it a 8+. But somehow the story writers probably thought; lets not make it a Joker movie after a hour. Lets just make it a court movie with a person who thinks he is the Joker and a woman that thinks she is Lee( she dresses way to nice to come close to the character). For me the movie was really good till the part when Arthur and Lee go out the prison due to a fire. But then the movie turns into a theatre show. With way to much singing, you could hear the people in the cinema sigh when one of the persons start singing again after that part. We expected finally to see the real Joker and the chemical relation with Lee. What was building up till that fire.The way how the movie was shot, the quality of the characters are high and the setting in the movie is great. But....It is save to say, the movie is not what it should be and it is a waste of the crew that played in this movie.

All Todd Phillips did was perform, failing to truly evolve the character. Even he didn\\'t build the \"folie à deux\" state that the title promises. The carefully crafted Scorsese and Dark Knight references in part one were wasted, abandoned for a questionable new direction. The original film\\'s gritty realism and psychological depth seem at odds with a musical format, risking the loss of what made the first film so compelling. By shifting genres so dramatically, Phillips may alienate the audience who connected with the original\\'s dark character study.

Was I teletransported to a High School Musical (for grown ups), multiverse?The whole movie, was boring.. I mean, after each scene with a dialogue, you had to endure a music.. i think it was like 15 songs, or something like that.After watching the first Joker, this, burned my eyes. Why did they even do this?It felt like, I was watching a Lady Gaga concert, and Joker was her side kick.Joker\\'s character, was ruined. The script, lead his actions into something, that the character of the first movie would never do, or act like.The same goes for this \"Harley Quinn\" which acts nothing like the original Miss Quinn from the comics (or DC Universe). She does all the opposite things HQ would do.This could be other character, but never a Harley Quinn.. more like a random crazy pseudo fan chick, who likes to sing.After all that time enduring the musical moments (which I really want to fast forward with a control remote, but I couldn\\'t because I was in a cinema), we still have to deal with an absurd ending.Two facts: This movie was a huge Lady Gaga concert;\\nThe movie itself, meant to ruin Joker.Regarding the performances, Joaquin Phoenix was great, he did the best he could, following this horrible script.Regarding Gaga, she looked more like herself, after all, she is a singer.And this is it.. if you are still curious, go watch this.But don\\'t tell me, you hadn\\'t been warned!',\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': 'Big Disappointment',\n",
       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is a significant departure from the original \"Joker\" (2019), both in tone and execution, leaving some audiences disappointed. While the first \"Joker\" was celebrated for its gritty, realistic portrayal of mental illness and societal collapse, the sequel ventures into a musical direction that feels disjointed and lacks the same emotional depth. The shift to musical numbers with Lady Gaga\\'s Harley Quinn disrupts the raw intensity that made the original so impactful, leaving viewers feeling disconnected from the story.The narrative is muddled, and it often feels like style is prioritized over substance. While Joaquin Phoenix still delivers a strong performance, the overall impact is less striking. The original Joker\\'s chaotic descent into madness was grounded in a sense of grim reality, but the sequel\\'s fantastical elements undermine that realism, making it difficult to take seriously.Comparing it to Deadpool and Wolverine, it\\'s clear \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" falls short. DAW is known for its sharp wit, tight storytelling, and balance between humor and action. Even when it\\'s absurd, \"Deadpool\" stays self-aware and keeps its audience engaged. With Wolverine joining, fans experience dynamic, exciting action and a strong emotional core. \"Joker 2\" tries to be bold with its musical experiment, but it doesn\\'t land as well, lacking the entertainment value and consistent tone found in something like \"DAW\"On the other hand, \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" seems to miss out on this broad appeal. Its attempt at being more experimental with the musical elements may alienate viewers looking for the gritty realism that made the first Joker so impactful. While \"DAW\" is likely to ride the wave of fan service, humor, and nostalgia, \"Joker 2\" lacks that same broad draw. Even with big names like Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, its stylistic choices may be too niche to reach the same massive commercial success.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Five years. That\\'s how long I waited, eagerly anticipating the next chapter in Arthur Fleck\\'s dark, twisted journey that shook the world with Joker (2019). The first film was a masterpiece - gritty, raw, unapologetically real. People connected to it on a visceral level. But after seeing Joker: Folie à Deux, my one overwhelming thought was: Why, Todd? Why?The film had so much potential, but what we got was a chaotic mess, completely out of touch with what *Joker* had originally set up. Let\\'s break it down:Lackluster Storytelling: Where was the story? There was no cohesion, no forward momentum. The film felt like it was rambling, disconnected. *Joker* 1 had us gripped in Arthur\\'s descent into madness, but here? It felt like they just stitched together random scenes. There were no stakes, no real suspense, no build-up. Instead, we were left wondering what happened to the raw, unfiltered tension from the first film.The Musical: Completely Off Track: I get it - musicals are a bold move, but this one? It just didn\\'t fit. The entire concept felt like an unnecessary distraction, completely out of sync with the grim world that *Joker* inhabits. Lady Gaga is incredible - no doubt. She was probably the best part of the film, but the musical element didn\\'t mesh with the gritty, psychological intensity that made Joker so captivating in the first place. Instead of adding depth, it came off as pretentious and forced.Where\\'s the Cinematic Brilliance?: Joker 1 was visually stunning. The cinematography had a purpose - every shot, every angle told a story. *Folie à Deux*? Not so much. The visuals felt bland and uninspired. There was nothing that made me sit up and say, \"Wow, this is a work of art.\" It was as if they forgot the very essence of what made Joker so visually engaging.No Dialogues: Where were the sharp, thought-provoking dialogues that Joker was known for? The first film had lines that stuck with you long after the credits rolled. In Folie à Deux, there wasn\\'t a single line that stood out. The film left no lasting impact in terms of narrative or dialogue. It\\'s like they completely missed the point.Music That Didn\\'t Hit the Mark: And then there\\'s the music. What happened? The score of Joker 1 was haunting, a perfect reflection of Arthur\\'s psyche. In Folie à Deux, the music didn\\'t add to the atmosphere - it detracted from it. Nothing about the score felt like it belonged in the world of *Joker*. It lacked intensity, lacked emotional resonance, and ultimately left me detached.A Disappointing Direction: I can\\'t help but feel this film was made simply to cash in on the success of the first one. It felt rushed, like no one really cared about crafting a meaningful story. Todd Phillips delivered a piece of art in *Joker* 1, but here, it feels like he lost his way. Was this film even necessary? Did anyone ask for this? The brilliance of *Joker* didn\\'t need a sequel, especially not one like this.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'It was expected that the sequel to \"Joker\" would struggle to reach the same depth and impact as the first film. The 2019 original, directed by Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Phoenix, made waves with its dark, psychological tone, offering a unique take on the villain\\'s origin story. However, in \"Joker: Folie à Deux,\" Phillips seems to have lost his way, delivering a sequel that, while it has some interesting elements, feels disconnected and, at times, soulless.The first thing that stands out is the change in tone. While \"Joker\" explored an oppressive and decaying Gotham through a raw, almost realistic lens, \"Folie à Deux\" mixes elements of musical, courtroom drama, and a touch of fantasy, creating a film that seems undecided about what it wants to be. The inclusion of musical numbers-a bold and, in theory, promising idea-ends up being one of the film\\'s biggest missteps. Instead of organically blending into the narrative, the songs feel like jarring interruptions, flashy distractions that don\\'t really advance the plot or deepen the characters.The relationship between Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) and Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga)-the future Harley Quinn-is one of the central aspects of the story. However, this dynamic, which could have been fascinating and layered, ends up being shallow and predictable. Gaga, who\\'s already proven her talent in films like \"A Star Is Born,\" seems limited by a script that doesn\\'t give her much room to shine. Gaga\\'s Harley is less vibrant and eccentric than the version popularized by Margot Robbie, which could have been an interesting approach if the film knew what to do with this more restrained take. Unfortunately, her character ends up as a shadow of the anti-heroine we know, defined more by her obsession with Arthur than by her own motivations.As for Joaquin Phoenix, always intense and committed to his roles, he tries to bring depth to a character who, in this sequel, feels lost. Arthur is more beaten down, more disillusioned, and the film tries to convey this visually with a gray, oppressive cinematography. The problem is that, no matter how much Phoenix tries, the script doesn\\'t give him much to work with. The lack of clarity about Arthur\\'s intentions and emotional journey makes it hard for the audience to connect with him in a meaningful way. In \"Joker,\" Arthur\\'s arc was clear: a broken man, marginalized by society, slowly descending into madness. Here, that trajectory is muddled, without direction.The biggest problem with \"Folie à Deux,\" however, is the sense that everything is happening out of obligation. The film feels like it was made more out of pressure to continue a successful franchise than out of a genuine creative need. There\\'s a noticeable frustration in how the ideas are executed-it\\'s as if Phillips is trying to make a subversive film but doesn\\'t fully believe in his own choices. The visual and narrative references, which in the first film evoked Scorsese and 70s cinema, here turn into hollow pastiches, lacking the same impact or purpose.And it doesn\\'t help that the film\\'s pacing is sluggish. The long trial of Arthur, which should have been the emotional and narrative core of the plot, ends up being tedious and repetitive. There are moments where it feels like we\\'re stuck in an endless loop of courtroom scenes that go nowhere, while the potential to explore Arthur\\'s mental state-and how it influences his perception of reality-is only superficially touched upon.In the end, \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is more of a missed opportunity than a true continuation. The film tries to be many things at once-musical, psychological drama, social commentary-but doesn\\'t succeed in any of them. The lingering feeling is of a director unsure of what he wants to say or where he wants to take his characters, delivering a film that, despite strong performances and competent production design, ends up being frustrating and disappointing. If the first \"Joker\" was like a love letter to dark, disturbing cinema, \"Folie à Deux\" is like the creative hangover, trying to find its way but tripping over its own ambitions. Which is a shame.',\n",

Nothing really happens, there is no tension and the audience doesn't really have a reason to feel one way or the other about the message the film is giving.The court room scenes aren't interesting and the musical numbers don't seem to advance the narrative which makes them frustrating when considering the whole package.This is a very unfortunately sequel that did nothing to enhance or preserve the legacy of the excellent first film.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker: Folie A Deux (2024) :\\nMovie Review -After the blockbuster success of Joker (2019), Todd Phillips is back with a direct sequel, \"Joker: Folie A Deux.\" This time, the joker is not alone. Arthur Fleck is not alone anymore. He has found someone to love, and he doesn\\'t want to die. Lee, aka Harley Quinn, completes him; she \"gets\" him. \"She\\'s really something,\" says Arthur, and why not because she\\'s the only one who understands him, saying, \"He is not sick. He is perfect. Together, we are gonna build a mountain from a little hill.\" Now back to Joker\\'s climax and its psychologically disturbing characteristics, I asked myself, \"Did such a dark and intense story deserve a follow-up like this, I mean, the one filled with love, courtroom drama, and musicals?\" My heart said, \"Maybe yes,\" but my brain said, \"Maybe No!\"The film begins with mentally disturbed and nihilist Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) in jail, with his inner bones clearly showing up touching his external skin. This jail life was worse than the world outside-maybe that\\'s what they wanted to portray from Arthur\\'s point of view. He sees Lee (Lady Gaga) in a music room, and they create an instant attraction towards each other. Meanwhile, Fleck is going through medication and counseling, and his lawyer, Ms. Stewart (Catherine Keener), is trying to prove that he suffered through split personality disorder at the night of the crime. Lee is freed, and she goes on to give interviews about Fleck being a \"perfect\" guy to live in society, and then the trial begins with Harvey Dent (Harry Lawtey) fighting the case as an assistant district attorney. Will Arthur win the case? That\\'s what the film is all about in the second half.Frankly, I believe, the story of The Joker should have never become a love story or a courtroom drama, and here it becomes both. That wasn\\'t sensible at all. Yes, it doesn\\'t make sense to see a criminal who killed a person on a live show and five other people, trying to prove that it wasn\\'t him after all. Even a medical term like personality disorder can\\'t be an excuse in this case, as it was in Anniyan (2005). Moreover, seeing a morally disturbed and criminally advanced Joker as a puppet and a silent bully of the class doesn\\'t do justice to the image people have in mind. In the pre-climax scene, Joker sees a complete shift in his own mindset just after a sexual abuse by the guard. Similarly, Quinn\\'s obsession for the Joker, having a baby, and then abandoning him all happen so fast that you don\\'t see them as concrete reasons to carry the story. In short, it\\'s a \"love got him down\" kind of scenario, which has been in Hollywood since the 1930s in many gangster dramas, but instead of a femme fatale touch, Joker 2 is driven by guilty consciousness, dark blue nihilism, and personality conflicts. I still don\\'t understand, \"Why would Arthur even kiss his lawyer twice?\" Most of the musical numbers and crazy scenes I imagined from the trailer, turned out to be dream sequences, and a few were not there at all. Too much disappointment to Kitty!Performance-wise, it was a good show. Joaquin Phoenix stunned us all with his act in Joker, and he did it again in Joker 2. It\\'s just that the character has no graph and no soul this time, so it feels dry. The blood, the liquidated feel of that anger-everything was missing. Lady Gaga surprises as Harley Quinn-not very much to what we expected from the promos. She was looking promising from the pre-release movie clips already, and she delivers. A no-sorry female antagonist who doesn\\'t even care about her boyfriend who has finally turned yellow-oh yes, we don\\'t see such ladies in our movies often. Brendan Gleeson is that brutal guard in the jail, and be is awesome. Catherine Keener as a lawyer, Zazie Beetz as Sophie (a cameo), and Harry Lawtey as Dent, all have done fine in those small roles. Steve Coogan and dwarfy Leigh Gill add good support.Why would anyone want to make a Joker\\'s sequel a musical? I don\\'t understand. Joker: Folie A Deux\\'s musical numbers didn\\'t entertain me much the way that one scene from \"The Band Wagon\" (1953) did. Gaga singing the same lines or any other song would get my thumbs up any other day, but not today. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher was impressive. That smile with lipstick on a mirror and the top view of the four different color umbrellas taking Arthur in jail or all those dreaming musical sequences-Sher has done brilliant camerawork. Joker was conceived as a standalone film, and Joker 2 literally ends the saga-too quickly! The screenplay is boring and slow, which makes you feel sleepy (believe me, I felt so). The production design was fine, and the sound was well mixed, but nothing noticeable. I can\\'t even imagine that Todd Phillips directed a \"banger\" like \"Joker,\" and now he is the same person who directed a \"blunder\" like \"Joker: Folie à Deux.\" It\\'s just not acceptable. He hasn\\'t just disappointed the fans with this sequel but also destroyed the image of Joker created by Phoenix and himself only. Can\\'t believe how someone can really make a boring and meaningless sequel like this to a modern classic like \"Joker\" (2019). I wish it wasn\\'t \"true,\" and I could forget it as a \"fantasy.\"RATING - 4/10*',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Arthur Fleck, is now confined to a cold, isolated cell in Arkham asylum after his infamous crimes. His isolation feels endless until Dr. Harleen Quinzel, a psychiatrist with her own dark past, enters his life. Arthur, now fully embracing the Joker persona, speaks to her unresolved memory of watching her father stabbing her mother to death. He reveals that only by surrendering to chaos has he found peace and a sense of true freedom.As Harley listens, her curiosity turns into a dangerous fascination. She's drawn to his unfiltered honesty, the way he speaks about rebellion with a passion that lights up her own repressed darkness. The boundaries she once held firm blur; she becomes promiscuous, losing herself in strangers' arms. Her husband watches helplessly as she spirals-she cuts their children's hair in a grotesque display, tattoos her face, and paints their home in a manic frenzy. When he finally throws her out, she feels nothing but liberation. She is no longer Harleen Quinzel; she is Harley Quinn, Arthur's loyal priestess and the orchestrator of his revolution.Harley organizes protests and rallies, channeling her newfound madness into a growing movement. What begins as a grassroots rebellion against society's cruelty evolves into a full-fledged gang. She becomes the engineer behind the Joker's uprising, transforming the city with her fiery passion.Meanwhile, Arthur's trial looms. The lawyers want to plead insanity, but Arthur refuses-he insists Arthur Fleck is dead. Firing his legal team, he represents himself, bringing the people who failed him to the stand. One by one, he exposes the social worker who abandoned him as a child, the shrink who didn't care, and the show secretary who set up the cruel TV ambush with Murray. The climactic moment arrives when Harley herself takes the stand, declaring their twisted love with a devotion so raw and impassioned that it stuns the courtroom.The jury, moved or manipulated by the Joker's performance, delivers a shocking verdict: not guilty. Arthur walks free, and his victory feels like a triumph for every lost soul in Gotham.Years later, the Joker has become a cultural phenomenon. He runs a controversial podcast, captivating millions with his unapologetic and incendiary rhetoric. He even announces a run for office, his growing base of loyal followers sees him as a messiah. When his political ambitions are mocked and ridiculed, he retreats to the shadows, unleashing his criminal organization in full force. Harley, his ever-loyal queen, stands beside him as they take down corrupt politicians and mobsters, creating a dark legacy that shakes Gotham to its core waiting for his nemesis to come out of the shadows.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I went into the new Joker film with high hopes, but unfortunately, it didn't deliver. For the first time in my life, I actually fell asleep in the cinema - twice! The movie was painfully slow, with almost no real story to grab onto. The pacing was so off that I found myself just waiting for it to end, hoping that my own boredom would end with it.They really messed up what should've been a masterful scene, making it feel lackluster instead of gripping. Lady Gaga's voice was the only saving grace, adding a touch of quality to an otherwise underwhelming film. While it's clear the cinematography was well-executed, the film's visuals couldn't make up for the lack of substance.Overall, it felt like a beautifully shot, but ultimately hollow, movie. I couldn't wait for the credits to roll so I could escape my misery.\",\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': 'Mismatch of Audiences is a Failed Experiment',\n",
       "    'Review': 'I don\\'t have any statistics, but it is my hunch that the kind of audience that likes to watch dark and bloody thrillers don\\'t like musicals. Conversely, I would be surprised if people who go to movies like \"La La Land\", would be willing to sit through a tough movie about a killer in prison. The first Joker movie was produced as though it was a Martin Scorsese film, and it was a revelation (see my review). The filmmakers back then had no intention of producing a sequel. While watching the sequel, I analyzed the story structure. Fleck is now in jail and is preparing for trial. That is not enough story to fill a two hour movie. Even with the introduction and pairing up of Joker and Harlequin in this movie, momentum is stunted while Fleck remains in prison.For a more engaging story, all the events that happen later in this film should all be packed into the first act. The story I think audiences wanted was for Joker to break out of prison, begin his crime spree, and witness his transformation into the Joker we all know and love from \"The Dark Knight\".I wonder if the director and screenwriter asked himself \"What would Marty Scorsese do?\". (I suppose he could call him and actually ask him). Well, Mr. Scorsese actually made a musical very early in his career called \"New York, New York\", with Robert Deniro and Liza Minelli. It is not considered one of his stronger works and thus I have never bothered to watch it. But I doubt there is any similarity to Joker 2. I believe when the filmmakers were tasked to make a sequel, another angle was sought to make it worth their while.Hence, for the sake of adding more to the thin story, and to utilise a vehicle for their creative efforts, it became a musical. I don\\'t like musicals. But I was unsure what my reaction would be to this strange mix of a film, so I gave it a chance. I can\\'t help but bring up the Coppola movie \"Megalopolis\", which was released a couple weeks before this film. I was tossed about whether to see what was summarily declared a flawed film. Ultimately I decided to wait until video.My decision to see this film, despite the warnings about it being a musical, came down to curiosity. Knowing I was willing to see it at least once, I chose to screen it in Imax. Trying not to follow critic reactions to the film, I nevertheless had to admit the musical angle didn\\'t work for me. I don\\'t like musicals. I will chalk it up to a failed experiment. The most poignant aspects of the Joker character in the world of Scorsese were encapsulated in the excellent first Joker movie. Here in the sequel, the aspects of his life in prison are underwhelming, and the real source of energy lay outside the prison walls.As for Harlequin, she also was perhaps a little too normal. No real spark to her. Her character should have been extremely bi-polar, with mood swings that inspire appropriate set pieces. What I mean by \\'appropriate\\' is that filmmakers carefully avoid the pitfalls of getting too goofy and removing us from the gravitas of the story. Instead in Joker 2, their courtship is very dull. Even the musical numbers are restrained, albeit with a bit of bravado.There are some unexpected twists in the third act, but it takes too long to get there. However, it could very well be that time will change the attitudes toward this movie. I think of another Coppola movie, \"One from the Heart\". A very ordinary tale of a failing relationship set to music (but not a musical). It bombed when it opened, but later recognised as great filmmaking. So who am I to say what is at first an affront to audiences expecting a gritty thriller? It may spark its own subgenre and be lauded as great filmmaking.Final thoughts: This sequel is successful in accomplishing the idea of expressing Fleck\\'s fantasies as standard musical numbers, but it fails to put audiences under it\\'s spell. I give a 4 out of 10.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux is a daring sequel that takes the chaotic brilliance of its predecessor and amplifies it with a musical twist. Directed by Todd Phillips, this film once again stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, the tormented soul behind the Joker, and introduces Lady Gaga as Harleen Quinzel, better known as Harley Quinn12.Set primarily in Arkham State Hospital, the film explores the deepening madness and twisted romance between Arthur and Harleen. The narrative is both haunting and mesmerizing, with Phoenix delivering a performance that is as intense and unsettling as ever. Lady Gaga's portrayal of Harley Quinn is a revelation, bringing a raw and electrifying energy to the screen.The musical elements are a bold choice, adding a surreal layer to the already complex psychological landscape. The songs are hauntingly beautiful, with Hildur Guðnadóttir's score perfectly complementing the dark and twisted narrative. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher captures the grim atmosphere of Arkham, making the hospital feel like a character in its own right.While the film's pacing can be uneven at times, the performances and the audacious blend of genres make it a compelling watch. It's a film that challenges the boundaries of the superhero genre, offering a deep dive into the psyche of its characters.Verdict: Joker: Folie à Deux is a bold and unsettling sequel that will leave audiences both disturbed and enthralled. It's a must-watch for fans of the original and anyone interested in a unique cinematic experience.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"This take on the Joker could have only gone one of two ways: build up the Joker on his next steps towards the ultimate super-villain, or fold him up and place him neatly back into his plastic box with the rest of the toys. This is the most basic way of illustrating why this film shouldn't have been made in the first place. Since, it has been made plain by Todd Phillips that he didn't want to make this a franchise, or go beyond this sequel, then the latter boring option of resolving the events of the first film was the only course, and of course, what's the point of that.Even some of the oft praised, somewhat original, parts of the film, the opening animation sequence for example, foreshadow that you're in for a completely contrived (and completely absent from the first film) bit of screenwriting armchair psychology. Was the Joker a distinct personality of Arthur Fleck or just one dark side of him? Was the Joker just the abused loner all along? There is no deeper sigh to be had.In scene after scene, you keep waiting for the unfolding events to click into some kind of rhythm, but you get the sense that every time the writers weren't sure what to do next, they would distract you with a musical number from Lady Gaga. There was no natural flow, it all felt flimsily strung together, and that's all thrown on top of, and largely because of, a set of circumstances in which telling a compelling story was probably nearly impossible in the first place.\",\n",

I enjoy camp movies and I think there could be a lot of artistic merit and show of talent within non traditional cinema storytelling. E.g. Lighthouse, Poor Things.So a Joker and Harley musical sounded like a lot of fun. Especially since they can incorporate a lot of compatible elements like their quirkiness, physical and wit based comedy, their showmanship, their violence, and the overall over the top Gotham aesthetic that can be found in a lot of DC media/comics. And Harley will also be played by a great singer who does a lot of over the top performances. It must at least be somewhat good.Instead it was so boring, and miserable. It was self indulgent bleakness that was pointless in every possible way. It should be impossible to make a Joker and Harley musical this excruciatingly dull. And yet they achieved it. And I watch a lot of miserable movies (I liked A Serbian Film), at least those movies remember that there should still be an element of fun. It's like they wanted the movie to be unwatchable.I do have a lot of other issues with the movie but i expected or at least can deal with those issues.

The first instalment of Joker was a breath of fresh air, particularly considering films portraying the DC comics world have often received mixed reactions, usually predominantly negative. Joker was dark, edgy and humorous. Joker Folie a Deux has none of these qualities. The concept of the film being part musical sounded a weird idea when I first heard about it, but with Lady Gaga on board I thought it could work. Making the basis of the film a courtroom 'drama' was a massive own goal though. The rhythm of the film fell as flat as a pancake. I feel sorry for Joaquin Phoenix who clearly suffered for his art judging by his gaunt appearance. This is another classic example of Hollywood trying to be too clever for its own good. The writers need to understand that 'if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it' Give the fans what they want and they will return time and again. A massive wasted opportunity.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"*Please stop singing* - Joker whispers pleadingly at one point, summarising the audience thoughts. (one of the few times where I actually heard a reaction from my fully packed auditorium)When Joker (2019) was released, it shocked audiences and critics alike, becoming a box office phenomenon, grossing over a billion dollars and earning widespread acclaim. A bold gritty, raw, and subversive experience that heavily borrowed from cinematic masterpieces like Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, while weaving in elements from Fight Club. These influences were evident, but ultimately, no one cared that the film wasn't entirely original because it was still brilliant in execution. Todd Phillips crafted a grim character study of Arthur Fleck, anchored by Joaquin Phoenix's transformative performance. It became a near-instant classic, defining what a modern psychological thriller could be within a comic book framework.Now, five years later, Joker: Folie à Deux tries to recapture that magic - and fails. Spectacularly.Phillips, this time, ventures further into his own vision, no longer leaning on the established classics that shaped the first film. The result? A disjointed, unfocused sequel that tries to be many things but masters none. The film attempts to blend multiple genres, from courtroom drama to psychological thriller to musical, yet never fully commits to any of them. Each element feels like a half-measure, teasing an interesting direction before abandoning it entirely. The end product is a film that has no clear narrative thread or identity.The most baffling creative choice was to mak Folie à Deux a musical. It's not inherently a bad idea - musicals can offer powerful commentary and depth when done well. However, here the songs feel awkwardly shoehorned into scenes, interrupting the already meandering plot. The musical numbers don't blend seamlessly with the story or add emotional weight; instead, they become unnecessary distractions rather than a hoped deeper exploration of the Joker's psyche. There's no clear reason why the Film needed to be a quasi-musical other than to stretch the thin story. Without these showpieces the film would be significantly shorter and its hollowness more obvious.Joaquin Phoenix's return as the Joker, while highly anticipated, is underwhelming. In the first film, his portrayal of Arthur Fleck was raw, disturbing, and compelling - a character study of a man unraveling. In the sequel, however, his character lacks the same depth and nuance. The film rehashes many of the same emotional beats and traumas from the first movie, offering little in terms of new insight. There are even flashbacks and redundant references to the events of the previous film, as if Phillips wasn't sure what direction to take and decided to lean heavily on past glories. Phoenix's delivers a strong performance but it's not as compelling as the first time. It felt kind of dispassionate at times, as though he either grew tired of the role or was given too much freedom in his portrayal. As a result, the Joker, once a tragic figure you couldn't take your eyes off, becomes less tangible and more abstract. The menace and unpredictability that made him such a fascinating character are absent here.Lady Gaga, meanwhile, brings a raw energy to her role as Harley Quinn, but she is underutilized throughout the film. Her character has none of the layers we saw in Margot Robbie's take on Harley Quinn. Gaga's Quinn feels like a shell of a character, a missed opportunity to add a new dynamic to the Joker's story. The chemistry between Phoenix and Gaga is there but never quite takes off, leaving Gaga's talents largely wasted.The pacing of Folie à Deux is its biggest downfall. The first half of the film moves so slowly that it feels as if it's deliberately wasting time, only for the second half to be nothing more than a repetition of the first Joker. Rather than progressing the narrative, the film constantly looks back, rehashing events from the first film through unnecessary exposition and flashbacks. There is no forward momentum, no fresh take on the story, and no meaningful development in the Joker's psychological journey. This backward-looking structure also dilutes any potential the film had in exploring new aspects of Arthur Fleck's mind. The psychological depth that was so integral to the success of the first film feels watered down here, leaving nothing of substance to grasp onto. The final act completely derails whatever semblance of narrative cohesion the film was trying to maintain.The final scenes leave the viewer not with a sense of closure or deeper understanding, but with frustration and confusion. It's a messy, misguided conclusion that fails to tie together the film's already loose threads. Call it provocation without substance. The viewer is left asking, What was the point of all this?Of course visually, the film is striking. Todd Phillips and his team have an eye for powerful imagery. The lighting, cinematography, and overall production design are aesthetically pleasing, with some hauntingly beautiful moments - particularly those involving the Joker, cigarette in hand, smoke swirling in the dim light. But there are only so many times you can watch the Joker, dramatically bathed in backlight, exhale cigarette smoke before even that feels tiresome. While Phillips deserves credit for crafting a beautiful film on the surface, it lacks the emotional and psychological depth required to make those images stick.The first film was a visceral exploration of societal alienation, child abuse and the therefore created mental illness, the sequel is aimless, shallow, and scattered. Instead of offering a deeper look into the mind of the Joker, it feels like Phillips wanted to make a statement - one that rebels against critics, fans, and even comic book lovers. But in doing so, he forgot to make a coherent film. What we're left with is a movie that's all style and no substance, a failed experiment that never finds its footing.Final Verdict: Todd Phillips swung for the fences with Joker: Folie à Deux, but missed. With weak character development, disjointed pacing, and a musical aspect that adds nothing, the film fails to capture the essence of what made the first Joker so memorable. The finale, which could have offered some redemption or clarity, instead devolves into a nonsensical, extravagant mess that leaves the audience bewildered and frustrated. Even the striking visuals can't mask the hollow core beneath, leaving the sequel as a perplexing and underwhelming addition to the Joker's story.Safe to say the biggest disappointment of the year. 3,5/10.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"A showcase of Joaquin's talent no doubt. His performance mixes subtlety and overblown grandeur to great effect. The film continues the originals commentary on mental illness and how badly supported sufferers are. It is of course a fictional tale, but there are plenty of reasons to ponder how close the fiction matches the facts of inadequate social care and mental health funding in real life. The movie is dark, no bundle of laughs that's for sure. The biggest bugbear has to be that I remain unconvinced that musical standards present the best opportunity to tell that particular story! 5/10 for the movie. 10/10 for JP!\",\n",

What was once a gripping, character-driven narrative has now turned into a mindless cash grab, losing the psychological depth that made the original special. The musical numbers feel out of place, as if they're only there to distract from the fact that this sequel lacks direction and purpose. The singing doesn't add to the plot or the character's complexity-it merely pads out an empty script. Instead of expanding on the story, it diminishes the impact of the original, turning a thought-provoking film into an uninspired spectacle. Enjoy at your own risk.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Or \"the Clown with his pants falling down\".This film had the potential to be memorable, but instead, it seems to be deliberately dull. As the movie itself states, \"All we had was the fantasy\" and they gave up on it. So now, \"we aren\\'t going anywhere\"!I didn\\'t particularly like the original (due to my own expectations and interest in the franchise). Who goes to the theater expecting a realistic, somber tale about one of Batman\\'s most iconic villains detached of its more fantastical elements? But even I could see what the original delivered-Powerful imagery of someone becoming a symbol and an emissary of chaos and change. It had depth, it was a good study on the topics and even a message! But it was never about THE Joker. It was a good movie with a franchise label slapped on so it would sell better.. and it never had the intention to deliver on it\\'s promise. It was clear to me then, and now it seems to be obvious to everyone else now! The negative reactions come as no surprise, as they chose not to follow through on the character and what audiences rightfully expected.This sequel is well-shot, well-cast, and executed according to its own vision. The premise was solid, and the foundation could have been interesting.. but doesn\\'t build upon that, the script and interactions are weak, and leaves the audience without gratification. Instead, it closes the book on the story of a man that just wanted normalcy! And personally, I think it was fine.More than anything, I found Lee Quinzel to be one of the few aspects that echoed the promise of the original. She wanted him to keep the chaos alive. But in the end, there\\'s no grand, satisfying plan. Fantasies may be integral to the character, and she understood what music meant to him (as means of manipulation), but ultimately, they don\\'t help the film.. specially when they interrupt what it little it offers constantly.The unnecessary final \"nod\" at Christopher Nolan\\'s departure from WB is hollow, cheap and insulting. Watch it on streaming.. if at all.',\n",

Fast forward a few years and we get this self-indulgent overuse of what worked in sprinkles in part 1.What I mean was that the scenes when the Joker was dancing and flailing were like 5 times too many in part 2. It was basically like beating a cinematic success to death. Lady Gaga and her botoxed glow and duck lips also kind of seemed a bit misplaced. There were times when Gaga and Phoenix had in screen chemistry, but they were so over presented to the audience.One can only hope for a part 3 that redeems itself, but judging on past history of the majority of sequential films, the chances are low of that happening.The cinematography, music (song selections) and lighting was stunning and effective, but the script just seemed disjointed and hollow. The entire film takes place in institutions. We want a Joker that is roaming free amongst society. This story robbed us of that.',\n",

There are frequent musical numbers which supposedly represent Fleck's imagination, but all of them are fairly boring and sound the same.There's no action to speak of and no real plot developments. There's little-to-no references to Batman lore. There's no extravagant set pieces - almost all the movie takes place in a courtroom or in jail.

Lady Gaga also held her own and although I've always been a fan of hers for her unique voice as a singer, she has shown over the years that she is a force to be reckoned with on the big screen.

       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is one of this year\\'s most anticipated films, or maybe just my most anticipated film, yet it\\'s this year\\'s biggest letdown film. The first Joker is very special for me and my page, as this was the first movie I reviewed, and I also enjoyed it. I\\'m a very sentimental person, and when they announced that there would be a sequel, I was excited. Then they confirmed Lady Gaga would play as Harley; I was even more excited. The biggest lesson I learned from this movie, I guess, is to lessen your expectations. From the direction and writing, the whole film felt like it was written by a mediocre kid at school who thinks everything they did is superior---It\\'s that bad, really!The writing and direction felt uninspired and lazy. The film follows Arthur Fleck\\'s life, waiting for his trial for the crimes of Joker. While struggling with his dual identity as Arthur Fleck and Joker, Arthur stumbles upon true love and finds the music that\\'s always inside him. The synopsis may have the potential to be a poignant exploration of mental health, but the film struggles to find its footing. The pacing is almost unbearable, as it gets dragged and dragged with nowhere to go. The film doesn\\'t know what it is trying to convey; the dialogue is flat, and the musical element does not match the narrative.One of the most disjointed elements is the musical component, which seems awkwardly inserted rather than seamlessly integrated into the narrative. The music fails to enhance the story or characters, instead feeling like an afterthought. Although the musical element serves as Joker and Harley\\'s fantasies, it just doesn\\'t work well with the narrative they are trying to deliver. Adding the musical aspect to their dialogues made the film almost feel comical and pretentious. Lee said, \"I\\'m pregnant.\" \"What?!\" Arthur replied, then Lee, out of nowhere, belted out, \"Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near?\" It was hilarious.For a $200 million budget, it\\'s a massive letdown. It is weird to have this much budget, yet no extra or grand was happening. The film\\'s settings were only at the jail and courtroom, so where did the $200 million budget go? Compared to Denis Villeneuve\\'s \"Dune: Part Two,\" which was this year\\'s biggest film, it only has a $190 million budget, but the CGI effects and the quality of the film are far from \"Joker: Folie à Deux.\" Even the first installment has a budget of $65 million, yet it made an astounding $1.07 billion at the global box office.When it comes to the performances, both Joaquin Phoenix and Stefani Germanotta (famously known as Lady Gaga) were electrifying. I appreciate that they are singing live, which added authenticity to their character, and the contrast in their voices sounded so good. However, due to the film\\'s lack of characterization, the addition of Harley \"Lee\" Quinn to this saga is rather unnecessary and underutilized. The addition of Harley Quinn could have been a great character to explore, but as the movie progresses, she fades into the background although her character plays a vital role in Joker\\'s life; it\\'s not that she has less screen time but because there was nothing written for her character aside from being Joker\\'s love interest. Although Joaquin Phoenix was great in this movie, it\\'s apparent that they are capitalizing on his success in the first installment after winning the Oscar for Best Actor and the movie gaining $1 Billion at the box office. Still, sadly, it turned out to be a disorganized and uninspiring film.Everything in this film felt like a mistake. It\\'s a cash-grab movie with nothing promising to offer. The musical aspect could be more cohesive to the whole film. Even the final scene felt like Todd Philips just wanted to end the Joker saga to avoid any further sequels. From start to finish, the film stumbles to find its ground. The entire experience of watching this film felt like witnessing a series of missteps. It comes across as a project primarily motivated by the desire to generate revenue without offering anything genuinely innovative or exciting for the audience. As a sequel, there is an expectation to build upon the strengths of its predecessor, but this movie struggles to find its own identity and purpose. This film is particularly disappointing for fans of the first installment, like myself. The original set a high bar with its depth and complexity, and as someone who appreciated its nuances, I hoped for a sequel that would expand on those strengths. Instead, I left the theater feeling let down by a film that failed to capture the essence of what made the original so impactful.In conclusion, this sequel misses the mark on multiple fronts, failing to capture the depth and innovation that made its predecessor so compelling. Its lack of cohesion and purpose feels like a disservice to fans who anticipated a continuation worthy of the original\\'s legacy. The disjointed musical elements rushed ending, and overall inconsistency contribute to a viewing experience that feels more like a series of missed opportunities than a meaningful story. While the film may achieve commercial success or not, it ultimately falls short of delivering the artistic and narrative fulfillment that audiences were hoping for. As a fan, seeing such potential go unrealized is disheartening, leaving one to wonder what could have been with more thoughtful execution. \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is a testament that not all sequels are necessary.',\n",

Both my wife and me love the first movie, so we were excited to see this.Unfortunately the movie doesn't come close to what made the first movie great. The story just isn't even remotely interesting. It largely rethreads what happened in the first movie, but not even by showing but telling. There's only so many times you can hear characters drone on about how the joker shot someone on live TV. The movie is cut with a frankly ridiculous number of songs woven in that for the most part serve 0 purpose to the story and primarily just break up the pace. It felt like a rather poor attempt st a musical. Both me and my wife were groaning by the 4th song due to boredom, unfortunately they just kept coming. In a mostly empty theater (afternoon showing) there were still 3 seperate groups of people that walked out 45-30 minutes before the end (as what felt like the 10th song started in).Throughout the movie the ending is somewhat foreshadowed as we see Arthur coming to terms with what the joker has done. Phoenix does an amazing job of once again portraying a man struggling with mental issues. We were less impressed with gaga. While great in her own way she didn't feel like a good fit for Harley. The relationship between her an Arthur also felt like the wrong dynamic (which, considering the events of the ending, makes sense). We felt the entire movie should have been the first 45 minutes or so of the actual film (which might roughly be the runtime without all the useless songs) before the story really kicks off.In summary the acting and cinematography were great as it was in the first movie. But a pretty picture cannot save the absolute train wreck of a story and the lack of any character progression or stakes.\",\n",

It's a director's mess who gave into Gaga's pursuit of Harley quin and in turn gave away the movie. Watch it on HBO when it comes on ott as you can atleast skip nearly 1hr of the movie.A case study for NYU to teach how not to self immolate due to some actor's narcissistic epiphany.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"The first film did not need a sequel, but when we heard of a sequel, we had excitement. I have never felt so disappointed watching a film in my life. Apart from some brilliant acting from Joaquin and the guards, and the stunning visuals, this film practically has no other positives. The most disappointing aspect of this film, in my opinion, is the ending. The ideology and symbolism of the ending is perfect, but the execution seems rushed and is awful.The rest of the film feels dragged out and slow, with unneeded musical sequences every five minutes, but the most important thing of the film, was rushed.The lengthy courtroom sequence was the only storyline in the film. There was no character development of Harvey Dent. This could have been Harley's origin story but her 'shared madness' is not shown at all in this film.This film is nothing short of a cashgrab and it despises the first film by trying to completely undo what make Joker so great to begin with.If you genuinely watched the first ten/twenty minutes of this film, left for an hour, and came back in, there'd be no difference, as the storyline was lacking.To be honest, this is a must-see film for fans of the first Joker and DC, as it practically ends the potential world of Arthur Fleck.This film is a love/hate film, and in my opinion I have to watch this again to get my head around what I just witnessed.3.7 out of 10 for me.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"This feels more like a spin-off than a true sequel, spending most of its runtime rehashing the original through court scenes and interviews, rather than pushing the story forward. The writing is serviceable at best, often relying on thin threads to loosely tie one musical dream sequence to the next. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is fine, but it lacks the raw intensity that defined his portrayal in the original. Lady Gaga, on the other hand, seemed to intentionally tone down her usual flamboyance, likely to avoid overshadowing him, which, while understandable, feels like a missed opportunity for a more dynamic performance.The musical numbers, full of energy and spectacle, are easily the highlight of the film, with the singing and dancing offering moments of reprieve from the otherwise sluggish narrative. Unfortunately, these sequences can't sustain the film's momentum. The lack of a substantial plot causes the movie to feel overlong, dragging on for more than two hours, making it feel unnecessarily stretched. Without the gripping psychological tension of its predecessor, the film struggles to find its footing, leaving it more of an indulgent showcase for musical theatrics than a coherent, engaging continuation of the story.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker 2 is a massive disappointment when compared to the brilliance of the first film. The decision to turn what was initially a dark, psychological character study into a musical is baffling and completely undermines the tone that made the original so powerful. The musical numbers feel out of place and detract from the raw, gritty world that was built in Joker 1. What's even worse is that the spotlight shifts almost entirely from the Joker himself to Lady Gaga, making it feel less like a Joker movie and more like a Lady Gaga showcase.In Joker 1, there was a subtle yet significant tie to the larger Batman universe, with references to Bruce Wayne and Gotham City that added depth and context to Arthur Fleck's descent into madness. However, Joker 2 abandons all of that, losing any connection to the broader world that could have made the story more meaningful. The film's narrative becomes so centered on Gaga's character that it might as well have been titled Lady Gaga, not Joker.The only saving grace of this movie is Joaquin Phoenix's incredible performance as the Joker. His portrayal is once again mesmerizing, showing the tortured and chaotic nature of the character. But even Phoenix's brilliance can't save a film that feels disjointed, tonally confused, and lacking the substance that made the first one so iconic.\",\n",

The musical numbers occasionally work, but more often than not, they disrupt the flow, leaving the audience in my theater dreading each one as they appeared. It\\'s a puzzling choice, especially since it felt like the film\\'s target audience wasn\\'t suited for this musical direction.Arthur\\'s relationship with Harley feels underdeveloped, and the progression was predictable, offering little emotional impact. Each scene between them felt like it was building toward something deeper, but ultimately, it just led to \"one more song.\" The chemistry between them, while not terrible, lacked the complexity and tension that could have driven their dynamic further.The tone stayed consistent with the first film heavy-handed and occasionally oppressive. There was less of the classic violence often associated with Joker, which I didn\\'t particularly mind, but the film\\'s messaging still felt forceful and lacked nuance.The third act is where the film finally comes alive, albeit briefly. Here, we start to see some character progression, particularly in how the two worlds have always coexisted. There\\'s a shift that hints at a deeper message about society\\'s celebration of grifting and deception, though it\\'s not fully explored. The fading paint on Arthur\\'s face, symbolizing the gradual dissolution of his facade, was a nice touch one of the few visual details that added depth to the story.In the end, much like the first Joker, Folie à Deux falls short.

       "    'Review': 'Joker: Folie à Deux, directed by Todd Phillips, is a sequel to the critically acclaimed Joker (2019) starring Joaquin Phoenix, but it falls short of the raw intensity and thought-provoking nature of its predecessor. The film was intended to explore the concept of folie à deux-a psychological condition where two individuals share the same delusional belief. However, despite its title, the movie fails to fully engage with this complex psychological theme, leaving the audience with more questions than answers and a sense of missed opportunity.A Misunderstanding of Folie à Deux\\nIn its essence, folie à deux refers to the transmission of delusions from one person to another, often resulting in a shared psychosis. The film hints at this dynamic, particularly in the relationship between Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) and Harley Quinn (Lady Gaga), but it never delves deeply enough into the psychological implications of their shared madness. Harley\\'s transformation into the devoted companion of the Joker, often portrayed in comics and films as a descent into madness alongside Arthur, feels incomplete in this movie.Instead of focusing on how Arthur\\'s twisted worldview infects Harley\\'s psyche, the film opts for multiple musical numbers that distract from the core narrative. These singalongs, while visually interesting, don\\'t add the emotional or psychological depth needed to explore the idea of shared madness. Rather than enhancing the story, these sequences feel like unnecessary distractions, prolonging the runtime and diluting the intensity that made the first Joker film so compelling. In fact, without these musical interludes, the film could have been much tighter, and perhaps, more focused.The Courtroom Focus and Missed Potential\\nA significant portion of Joker: Folie à Deux is spent preparing for courtroom scenes that are meant to build tension around Arthur\\'s fate. Unfortunately, these scenes fall flat, lacking the impact they should have had. The legal drama, which could have provided a powerful setting to explore Joker\\'s manipulation and the spread of his delusions, becomes a drawn-out and somewhat tedious process.Arthur\\'s trial is supposed to be a climax, a moment where the consequences of his influence on society become apparent, but the execution feels underwhelming. The court scenes miss the chance to create a meaningful confrontation or delve into Arthur\\'s manipulative genius. Instead, they serve as more of a backdrop for the film\\'s plot rather than being a pivotal turning point in the narrative.By the time Harley Quinn abandons Arthur, it feels like the central relationship has been underdeveloped. Her departure from him because he refuses to fully embrace the Joker persona doesn\\'t carry the emotional weight it should. It leaves the audience questioning what the point of their relationship was in the first place. Their dynamic is a critical part of the Joker\\'s mythology, and in this film, it feels as though the filmmakers only scratched the surface.A Lack of Direction and Purpose\\nOne of the major problems with Joker: Folie à Deux is its lack of a clear, coherent message or purpose. At the end of the film, it\\'s hard to pinpoint exactly what the director was trying to convey. Unlike the first Joker, which offered a raw, gritty look into Arthur Fleck\\'s descent into madness and his transformation into the Joker, this sequel seems to lack that same clarity of vision.It\\'s true that Arthur, as the Joker, manages to \"transmit\" his delusional beliefs to many of his followers, both outside and inside the courtroom and jail. This mirrors the folie à deux concept on a larger societal scale, as Arthur\\'s twisted perspective seems to resonate with the disenfranchised and downtrodden, sparking a kind of mass hysteria. However, this theme, while present, isn\\'t explored in a way that feels meaningful or new. Instead, it feels like a rehash of what we already saw in the first film, but without the same emotional or intellectual punch.Additionally, many characters-including the Joker himself-seem disappointed that Arthur doesn\\'t fully commit to being the Joker. This sense of dissatisfaction pervades much of the film, both within the story and for the audience. There\\'s an expectation that Arthur will fully embrace his chaotic, anarchic nature, but that moment never quite comes, leaving viewers with a sense of incompleteness. The Joker\\'s ultimate failure to live up to the expectations placed upon him feels anticlimactic.An Alternate Universe and Disappointing Ending\\nThe film also creates the sense that this Joker exists in an alternate universe separate from the Batman mythology that fans are familiar with. This alternate universe approach is somewhat jarring and further removes the film from any of the Batman movies we\\'ve grown to love. The ending especially feels disconnected from any broader narrative, as it offers no real sense of closure or continuity with other DC films. For fans hoping for a deeper connection to the larger Gotham mythos, the film\\'s ending will likely feel frustrating and unsatisfying.Moreover, the final scenes, where the Joker\\'s influence on his followers becomes apparent, don\\'t provide enough payoff for the buildup. The film could have approached the Joker\\'s rise to power in a more engrossing way, focusing on the psychological intricacies of Arthur\\'s relationships and the societal consequences of his actions. Instead, it leaves the audience questioning what exactly they were meant to take away from the experience.Final Thoughts\\nUltimately, Joker: Folie à Deux is a film that had immense potential but failed to live up to it. By focusing too much on style over substance-through the musical numbers and underdeveloped relationships-the movie misses the opportunity to explore its central theme of folie à deux in a meaningful way. The courtroom drama, which should have been a central focus, fizzles out, and the much-anticipated relationship between Joker and Harley Quinn lacks the depth and complexity that their shared madness should have conveyed.While Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance remains strong, the film as a whole feels disjointed and unsure of what it wants to say. The idea of Arthur transmitting his delusions to others, while present, isn\\'t fully realized, and the film\\'s ending leaves viewers wondering what the point of it all was. For fans of the first Joker film, Joker: Folie à Deux may feel like a disappointing and unnecessary addition to a story that was already complete.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'This happens when you never embrace the true direction of your film and yet it turns out to be the case. After all the timidity to identify the sequel to the 2019 box office monster a musical, ladies and gentlemen, Joker: Folie à Deux is a musical. But I am not going to clobber, whack, and thump on this film just for its genre because I like a lot of musical films. And I thought those staged sequences we all saw in the trailers should make sense for our two unsound characters. It did not. Even with the undeniable talent of Lady Gaga, whom will bring us to my next point.I was not stirred by the announcement about the sequel until the addition of Harley Quinn. I love these two characters so much, especially as a duo. All toxicities and abuses aside, Joker and Harley Quinn\\'s power was no joke. Casting Lady Gaga did not turn me off. I know how great she is as an actress and a total performer. The craziness of her artistry should add up. Only to learn her character was a stripped version of the inspiration and more akin to Punchline, Harley\\'s replacement as Joker\\'s henchwoman. Lee was underutilized in Joker: Folie à Deux, a victim of poor, shallow writing of her character, nothing but a bait to comic and Harley fans. Props, however, to her dedication for this character that Gaga even produced a full-length companion album (\"The Joker\" currently on repeat). But I\\'m sorry; her chance to an Oscar nom is now improbable.Phoenix was just as scary good as his Oscar-winning performance in the first film. Gleeson was also a standout as one of the Arkham guards. Guðnadóttir\\'s score was kind of subdued this time, but just equally haunting as her work five years ago. It\\'s Lawrence Sher\\'s cinematography I enjoyed in this sequel the most.Joker: Folie à Deux shouldn\\'t have happened. Too much for Todd Phillips\\' experimentalism and boldness only to under-deliver and land tone-deaf. This is hardly my Jarley. I hope that last scene ultimately draws the curtains on this franchise.',\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': \"We get what we don't deserve\",\n",
       "    'Review': 'Co-written and directed by Todd Phillips, the movie centers around Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a failed comedian who is now incarcerated at Arkham State Hospital and waiting for a trial after committing a murder. There, he meets Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga), and they develop their relationship as the Joker and Harley Quinn.Warner Bros. Probably thought they were cooking something when they greenlit a sequel for 2019\\'s Joker, but instead, they give us more examples of why not every movie deserves a sequel, especially when the first one is obviously enough. I still remember at the time of its release, the ending had already sparked a conversation and many theories among the audience, and that\\'s it, there was no need to go much further than that.Well, the joke\\'s on me for being pumped about this unnecessary follow-up. It\\'s evident that Phillips wasn\\'t planning to make a second movie in the first place because Folie à Deux contradicts everything that happened in the previous one, the idea for a sequel is probably born out of demand from the studio, nothing else. That\\'s why whatever the message they are trying to say isn\\'t working, it made Arthur (Joker) like a completely two different person in this one. Arthur had so many things against him to fully embrace the Joker persona at the end, and the build-up to that moment is perfect, but here, he suddenly forgetting about things that \"made\" him before and, in the end, says he isn\\'t what people are saying because of uhh, moral conflict? (i don\\'t know, lmao).Lady Gaga did best with what was given to her even though all of her excellent performances were in the musical segments because she was doing what she\\'s good at....singing. The same goes for Phoenix; he isn\\'t as impressive as he was before. Their relationship is a real letdown with almost no development, they are only having fun when they\\'re signing. Some of the musical bits are good I even enjoyed it but the transition of the scene always throws me off and they\\'re making intense moments into nothing.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'I felt positively about the first \"Joker\" film, though not perhaps as positively as many others did, so perhaps it\\'s quite fitting that I feel negatively about \"Joker: Folie a Deux\" though not as negatively as many others seem too.Whilst awaiting a competency hearing ahead of his trial for several counts of murder, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) meets Lee (Lady Gaga) another patient at Arkham, though one on minimum security. Fleck is allowed to participate in the musical therapy class where he talks to Lee, who explains that she loved \\'The Joker\\' since seeing him in a TV movie about his actions and the pair begin a love affair. Fleck is torn between supporters who want to see \"The Joker\", and his lawyer Maryanne (Catherine Keener) trying to make a case for him avoiding the death penalty, for reasons of insanity.Not unlike the first film, \"Folie a Deux\" again engages in numerous fantasies and dream sequences allowing you to question which sections are actually happening and which are \"made up\". Because of that it\\'s open to endless interpretation and analysis. Personally, I don\\'t particularly buy the \"we must punish the people with whom the first film resonated, because they are the \\'wrong people\\'\" suggestion. If, for no other reason, than it\\'s produced by Warner Brothers who have already shown their willingness to take a completed movie and turn it into a vaulted tax write off. That argument gives the producers too much credit.I did feel like the musical numbers were disappointing. I\\'m not sure why, given the time, and money, to turn their fantasy dance numbers into almost anything - they\\'re all so low key. Lady Gaga particularly keeps things restrained, perhaps as if she (or the production) was concerned about blowing Phoenix away too much. It feels like a small film too, essentially restrained to only three or four real sets. The courtroom scenes never feel like they really get going and there\\'s no twist or reveals that stem from that.I haven\\'t revisited the first \"Joker\" film, since seeing it at the cinema and I can\\'t imagine that I\\'ll be back to this one again, but I never felt it was \"walking out\" bad - just dull.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Regardless of your thoughts on Joker (2019), one thing that can be agreed on is that it did not need a sequel. But, unfortunately for everyone, money talks and its clear WB wanted a sequel. And so here we are, with an unnecessary sequel to a decent first movie which ended fairly well. What we have now is a film desperate to right the perceived wrongs of the first, a bloated, meandering sequel that ultimately has nothing to say.To start with the positives, and there are a few, the acting in this film is great. I was surprised that Joaquin Phoenix still gave it his all, when he could have easily phoned it in. Lady Gaga was also excellent as Lee Quinn (that's her name) and the pair have solid chemistry on-screen. The film is also well-shot, maintaining the aesthetic of the original film and the score is pretty solid, although it reuses a lot of the first film's score. An aspect that I wasn't expecting to like was in fact the musical numbers. Some are actually quite solid and I can see the potential in making this a musical. It does play well into the Joker's psyche. It is then a real shame that the execution is all over the place with very few of the numbers truly contributing to the overall film and most are clearly there to distract from the pacing, plot and writing.This film is pretty slow, and not a lot happens. At times it feels incredibly repetitive, with a lot of scenes feeling redundant and so often a musical number is sprinkled into a conversation just to make it appear interesting. The film lacks a strong POV, constantly switching between Arthur and Lee, when I personally think having Lee be the POV would have made the film stronger. The character work is also questionable, especially when it comes to Arthur. It seems Todd Phillips disliked how many people enjoyed Arthur's descent into madness and thus decided to regress him back, presenting The Joker as merely a persona, even though the first film ends with him fully giving in. By the end, I am not even sure what the point is anymore. I can see the idea, but it is poorly executed with little attention given to it. What frustrates me most is that this film is ripe with potential, but it squanders nearly all of it which leaves this film feeling half assed and empty in the writing department.Overall, this film just doesn't need to exist. It reduces any significance the first one had, whilst adding nothing new itself. It is constantly on the cusp of something potentially great, but it never commits. It is a shame, because there is great potential here, and everyone (barring the writers) seem to be giving it their all. A film that will leave you with a blank expression once its all said and done.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"My review of Joker is that it felt a bit short and didn't cover an extensive range of material. The pacing was slow, and the film was mostly confined to just two main settings: the prison and the courtroom. However, what I appreciated about the movie was the insight it gave into the Joker's mind. It was fascinating to see how his past experiences shaped him into the person he became.While Joker felt limited in scope with its slow pace and confined settings, it excelled in exploring the psychology of the character. The deep dive into the Joker's troubled mind and the events that shaped him was captivating. We got a glimpse of his transformation, from his traumatic past to the circumstances that led to his current state. The movie didn't rely on action or numerous locations to make its impact; instead, it focused on the psychological unraveling of the Joker, which made for a thought-provoking experience. The minimalistic approach in storytelling allowed the audience to fully absorb the complexity of his character.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"The best way to describe Joker: Folie à Deux is that it's an uneven road, occasionally lined with cherry blossoms, but ultimately leading to nowhere.What's frustrating is that everything is there: unparalleled performances, a multidimensional soundscape, state-of-the-art set design, vibrant and well-realised musical numbers, iconic scenes and imagery, a masterclass in cinematography and lighting - But all of it amounts to nothing as the director's ego overpowers the script's ego.An argument can be made that the film does too much, while another segment of viewers might rightfully claim that the film doesn't do enough to justify its existence.The makers try to tell a story that simply isn't there. The characters at the start are unchanged by the end (if you can call that an end). There's an illusion of journey when in reality it never began.Half of this film is a song sequence. Now, I don't mind musicals, and the symbolism of music is well justified within the film. But by the time the 15th song rolls, it feels like the magician has no more tricks up his sleeve. Symbolism comes at the cost of effective storytelling.With a reported $200 million budget, Joker 2 feels miniscule compared to its predecessor, which outclasses it in nearly every aspect. It has its moments, but the negatives outweigh the positives for me. A narrative mess, a cinematic blunder, and a disservice to the character.\",\n",

And YES, unfortunately 5 stars is a justified rating. Not terribly bad, but nonetheless a failed sequel.The bad: let's forget about the songs for a moment, let's us only focus first on the spoken acting scenes. Are those any good? All the acting is done really well, BUT that doesnt make it an interesting, captivating or thrilling sequel, ON THE CONTRARY, the spoken acting scenes are incredibly BORING. Why? Because it's basically nothing more but a boring court room movie. NOTHING BUT BORING COURTROOM TALK. Who is gonna wanna watch that?!More bad: NOW let's focus on the songs. The songs aint bad by itself either. Joaquin Phoenix CAN really sing and he has got a dark rough edge to his voice which gives the songs a nice dark twist, BUT unfortunately the songs dont add anything to the core of the movie and the songs are not that good that they stand out as a musical. So it's NEITHER a great musical (at all), NOR is it a thrilling movie, (if yoiu would only judge it by the spoken acting scenes).It's a FLOP. I LOVED the original Joker movie and I am great fan of Joaquin Phoenix, but this sequel (howewer well acted and sung) is a complete NOTHINGBURGER. Totally void of any real thrill or true drama.

       "   {'Review Summary': 'An underwhelming continuation of the brilliant original',\n",
       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is the sequel to the 2019 superhero/supervillain film \"Joker\". Once again directed and co-written by Todd Phillips (\"Road Trip\", \"Old School\", the \"Hangover\" trilogy) and starring Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, it is an underwhelming continuation of the brilliant original that doesn\\'t end up delivering what it promises.Sometime after the events of the first film, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is incarcerated at Arkham State Hospital awaiting trial for the murders and misdemeanors he caused years earlier. During his stay, Arthur struggles to deal with his duel identity as \"Joker\", unable to distinguish between his own actions and those of the destructive persona he created. As the media prepares to extensively cover the upcoming legal proceedings, Arthur meets Harleen \"Lee\" Quinzel (Lady Gaga), a new patient at the Hospital who admires him as the Joker and as his own damaged self. Amidst the ensuing chaos of media scrutiny and public outcry, Arthur and Lee\\'s infatuation with each other begins to grow, culminating in their mutual appreciation for the music inside of them.I am always hesitant to refer to a movie as a \"modern masterpiece\", however, I firmly believe that 2019\\'s \"Joker\" is well worthy of such an honour. This movie works not only as a fantastic contemporary origin story of one of the most famous comic book villains of all time but also as a social commentary on the human condition and the stigma of mental illnesses. As a result, the film managed to transcend the boundaries of your typical \"superhero\" movie, allowing audiences from all walks of life to take note of everything important it was trying to say. Although the film was clearly intended as a standalone feature, Warner Bros. Later decided to continue the story in the sequel \"Joker: Folie à Deux\", a decision that does not work in their favour as it fails to recapture nearly everything that made its excellent predecessor so impactful.In the years since his arrest, we see that Arthur Fleck has now built up quite a notorious reputation throughout his new home at Arkham Asylum. His fellow inmates fear and respect him for the anarchy he was responsible for years ago, and the guards frequently taunt him into telling them a \"funny joke\" to cause his Joker personality to emerge. Yet in spite of all this acknowledgement he once deeply craved, Arthur remains relatively quiet and mostly keeps to himself. Occasionally, Arthur\\'s signature pained laughing outbursts stemming from his condition may occur from time to time, but he does nothing about it until it eventually subsides. Later, we learn that Arthur is set to stand trial for his crimes, to which his law team try to argue that his actions were actually caused by his Joker persona, meaning he can enter an insanity plea and escape the death penalty. Though all of this seems like a solid way to begin a sequel to the original, what follows is where the film starts to fall apart from the seams.During a therapy session, Arthur comes into contact with Lee, a seemingly troubled woman who claims to have burned down her parents\\' apartment building. The two form a connection with one another and come up with a plan to \"ditch this joint\" and go on the run. The way the film chooses to present this to us is through song, with the pair of them singing and dancing to pre-existing music. Normally, I wouldn\\'t have minded this unorthodox addition to the film if it were handled properly, which unfortunately it isn\\'t. The problem here is that none of the songs are all that memorable and don\\'t really leave a lasting impression, and for a film that sets itself up as a musical, that is a major issue. Because of that, I never really felt as though these two were kindred spirits proclaiming their love for one another as much as a pair of weirdos singing along to music that only they can hear.Another issue is that the film\\'s screenplay lacks proper cohesion. In the original movie, every pivotal event that took place always flowed flawlessly from one scene to the next, with each character-focused moment communicating all of the necessary information back to the audience. Here, on the other hand, the plot feels so fragmented and inconsistent that it\\'s difficult to fixate your attention on a particular scene without concern as to whether it will matter later on. For instance, in this one scene involving Arthur professing his love for Lee, he is shown doing so during a televised interview, which you\\'d assume would lead to something important immediately after. However, this is not the case, as it quickly ends and its relevance to the plot is never brought up again. There are several other moments like this which constantly tease the audience that something huge about to happen, only for it to disappear into thin air a short time later. After a while, this makes the film incredibly frustrating to watch.To give credit where it is due, I really appreciate that the film was able to recreate the original\\'s superb cinematography and visual style. I absolutely loved the dreary, gritty imagery that director Todd Phillips used in the first film, which gave it a very distinct look to help this 1980s version of Gotham City stand out from all of the others. Thankfully, this sequel follows suit in that regard, as there were moments that I thought were visually stunning. Without giving away spoilers, there was this one part that involved Arthur and Lee looking into each other\\'s eyes with fire burning in the background. The blocking of this scene illuminates Arthur while Lee is mostly shown in the dark, symbolising the bright but destructive way she lights up his life. This proves that there was at least some creative thought put into this film from a visual standpoint, so it surprises me that virtually everything else falls flat in comparison.Reprising one of the greatest roles of his career, Joaquin Phoenix does everything he can to remind us of why his performance in the original film is now ranked alongside Heath Ledger as among the best live action depictions of the Joker. However, in the grand scheme of things, it just simply isn\\'t enough to save this film from the rest of its problems. Because of all the glaring faults in the film\\'s screenplay, direction, and plot inconsistencies, it\\'s near impossible to feel much empathy for Arthur this time around. His character does not do much aside from repeatedly yearn for Lee through song or make weak excuses for his criminal behaviour in the previous film. I missed all that anticipation and unpredictability of what Arthur would do next, as this was one of the key things that made him so interesting last time. Sadly, I never once felt any of that from this movie.Perhaps the biggest disappointment, for me at least, was the utilisation of Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn (a.k.a. Lee). In the lead up to the film\\'s release, I was actually looking forward to seeing how Gaga would portray the Joker\\'s female sidekick/love interest, as I thought she was a great choice to play this emotionally damaged character. Unfortunately, there\\'s hardly anything memorable worth mentioning about her involvement in the story other than her thinking what Arthur did in the first movie was \"bold\" and \"brave\". This could have been the perfect time to provide a commentary on toxic relationships and why many imprisoned murderers have loyal female fans, but the film squanders all these moments away at every given opportunity. What we get instead is a rather two-dimensional story of a mentally ill man and a mentally ill woman who have no other reason to want to be together other than that they are both unstable people. To add insult to injury, Lee is hardly even in the film enough to leave a lasting impression, and considering she\\'s supposed to be one of the main characters, this seems like a very bizarre creative decision.For a follow-up to one of the greatest films of the 2010s, the only thing that \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" has done is prove that just because you can make a sequel, doesn\\'t always mean that you should. After five years, I can still remember picking my jaw up from the floor in amazement after watching the first film, whereas with this one I was struggling to recall anything in great detail without the need to look it up online. Nobody is going to be playfully reenacting dance numbers from this movie and nobody is going to be quoting from it anytime soon like they did with its predecessor. In my humble opinion, Warner Bros. Should have left the original as a standalone film, as I think everything concluded perfectly then and there. It makes me think that this unnecessary sequel may just be one big joke at our expense. If it is, then I don\\'t get it.I rate it 5/10.',\n",

Especially when talking about mental health disorders. The portrayal of the disorder could have gone deeper. The failings of the system were grazed over. The ball was dropped in several scenes. However, the acting was phenomenal. Both Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga did their best with what they were given. Unfortunately, the storyline just didn't hold up. The musical additions made sense but went on for far too long. It felt like fluff and didn't really add anything to the film.

       "    'Review': \"I went into this curious and open to it apparently being a musical, but I feel kind of conned. I guess the joke's on me. As a musical, it falls really flat, and there's only so much heavy lifting Lady Gaga's voice can do. It made me wish I was rewatching Chicago instead, and Dancer in the Dark is a better crime/courtroom musical too.Joker: Folie a Deux feels provocative in an empty way, whereas the divisive original movie felt like it had a bit more to say and said it in a way that was often clear and engaging. This sequel is all over the shop, but not in a fun or varied way.The pacing is quite shoddy, and the interestingly grungy world of the first movie doesn't get explored much here, owing to so much of the film being set in a maximum security psychiatric facility or a courtroom. The fantasy sequences wear out their welcome after a very short while. There's little rhyme or reason as to when they appear and why.Joaquin Phoenix is good, but the performance feels lacking compared to the first seeing as the material lets him down. Lady Gaga does her best, but she's given far less to work with here than expected. No one gives an abysmal performance by any means, but no one has what they need to excel. The writing here feels lazy, and it hurts the actors.I'm a little more positive on how it looks. Some of this visually gives the film a pulse here and there. And though the songs aren't implemented well, the score here is excellent, courtesy of Hildur Guðnadóttir once again.I wanted to come away admiring the film going for broke and indulging in a genre lots of people seem to resist or outright reject. I feel that's what most people are going to latch onto and dislike by default with this film. I like musicals, though. I just don't really like this musical. Intriguing in theory but disappointing in execution.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Combining movie genres can be tricky business. When the mix is right, the outcome can be truly impressive, but, when it\\'s off, it can spell cinematic disaster. In the case of this long-awaited sequel to the 2019 box office and critically acclaimed success, unfortunately, the result is closer to the latter than the former. Picking up where the protagonist\\'s story left off, this saga about charismatic villain Arthur Fleck (a.k.a., the Joker) (Joaquin Phoenix) finds him in prison awaiting trial for his string of heinous crimes. Most of the picture\\'s first half takes place here, an unlikely venue for Arthur meeting the love of his life, the psychopathic Lee Quinzel (a.k.a., Harley Quinn) (Lady Gaga), who diligently stands by her man when he eventually goes to court, the primary focus of the film\\'s second half. So, at this point, the picture is already part prison film, part courtroom drama and part dark romance. But, if that weren\\'t enough, writer-director Todd Phillips draws upon a fourth genre - musicals - to make the mix even more overstuffed (but, hey, if you\\'ve got a talent like Lady Gaga at your disposal, why not, right?). The result is a convoluted, overlong, often-uninteresting offering that\\'s heavy on style but weak on substance and not especially interesting. Admittedly, the performances of the two leads and many of the supporting players (Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener and Steve Coogan in particular) are quite good, doing a more than commendable job of making this material look far better than it actually is. In addition, stylistically speaking, the picture is terrific when it comes to its production design, costuming and cinematography. And the soundtrack is great, too, including an array of superbly chosen standards to complement the narrative (even if there are a few too many selections). But these strengths by themselves aren\\'t enough to make a good picture overall; what\\'s stuck in between these elements feels more like filler than substance, and that\\'s where the movie falls apart. In my view, \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" isn\\'t as resoundingly awful as many reviewers have made it out to be in light of its artistic and aesthetic accomplishments, but that doesn\\'t mean this release is not without its share of problems, most notably in the dreadful writing and mishandled film editing. This is one of those pictures where you get to the end and are likely to heave a heavy \"Ho hum, so what?\" And that\\'s regrettable, given that the character and this picture\\'s predecessor both deserved better than what this follow-up has to offer. If you haven\\'t seen this yet, you might be better off sticking to the picture\\'s genuinely stellar trailer, as that\\'s ultimately much better than most of what\\'s found in this clunky 2:18:00 release.',\n",

The idea of Joker as a character has so much potential, and I was exited for all the interesting ways in which the story could have gone, but this simply didn\\'t. Yes, it\\'s musical, and while the musical numbers added little to nothing, yet I had absolutely no problem with them. The acting?

That realization burrows in slow, and by the end, you\\'re just sitting there thinking, \"That\\'s it? Really?\" It just seemed to go nowhere, especially where the character of Arthur/Joker was concerned. It is gorgeously shot and looks amazing; the movie, from a cinematic point of view, is stunning. The ambiance and atmosphere hit all the right notes. But with all that said and done, it doesn\\'t do anything.You just keep waiting for the story to take flight or do something major, and instead, it introduces Harley Quinn then. Nothing. It really feels like it\\'s digging itself into a hole instead of going anywhere meaningful. I think they should have taken the story in a whole other direction or did more with it.So for now, this feels like the end of this Elseworlds story, and truthfully, that is probably for the best.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'What you\\'ve heard is true. Joker: Folie à Deux is not good. But my reasons for not liking it, I think, are different from why most people don\\'t like it. Let me be clear, I don\\'t fault this movie for trying something new. I don\\'t fault it for taking big risks. I don\\'t fault it for directly challenging what made the first film so iconic. What frustrates me is how half-baked and half-assed everything is. For a film with such daring ideas, Todd Phillips clearly doesn\\'t have the courage of his convictions to follow through with any of them. The passion that should drive this film is missing entirely. Lazy is the best word to describe it.Arthur Fleck is in Arkham Asylum, awaiting trial. He\\'s beaten and run ragged by a thuggish gang of prison guards. One day, he meets Harley Quinn during a session of \"musical therapy\" and Harley falls madly in love with him. As it turns out, she\\'s attracted to the dangerous celebrity he\\'s become. Think of the psychotic love notes that real-life serial killers get in prison, and you have what this film is sort of touching upon. Since they both love to sing, they sing... and they sing... and they never stop singing. Yes, it\\'s a musical. A big jukebox musical, complete with choreographed dance numbers.I reiterate, I\\'m not against the concept of making this a musical. But it\\'s how they go about it here that\\'s so disingenuous and cynical. If Arthur and Harley sang only to themselves, with no orchestra backing them up, it would\\'ve been akin to the behavior of real-life psychopaths. Think of the Charles Manson prison interviews from the 1980s. But instead, it\\'s nothing more than an excuse to hear Lady Gaga belt out a few show tunes for the soundtrack.Lady Gaga is a fine actress, and an even finer singer, but Todd Phillips creates a version of Harley Quinn that gives her absolutely nothing to work with. She does not match Arthur\\'s mental illness in any way. She isn\\'t convincing as a person who would realistically be locked away in an asylum. You genuinely feel how cheaply she\\'s used to sell tickets here.We\\'re slogging along with this film for the greater part of two hours. But then, there\\'s the last 20 minutes. This, in my view, is where the greatest concepts and risks of the film are realized. The first Joker movie thrived as a spectacle that held a mirror to a decimated American society, obsessed with lone-wolf killers and their pathetic, selfish reasons for committing their atrocious crimes. This film wants to take that and smash it into a thousand pieces. Todd Phillips may be telling us that he never wanted Joker to be such a controversial film in the first place. I get the sense that not only is he unhappy to have made a sequel, but he\\'s pissed at how most of us interpreted it. Maybe it\\'s because I had lost so much patience by the film\\'s end, but I found the shocking conclusion to be cathartic and rewarding. As a microcosm of how we should view these horrible people as a society, it\\'s even more satisfying.I realize that everyone\\'s take on this film will be vastly different. That\\'s a great thing. Even bad films should get people talking. It\\'s a shame that that bad film is a sequel to Joker.',\n",

       "    'Review': '5.3/10 (Don\\'t Recommend)Oftentimes when I see a review, or reviews, of movies before I go see them and they\\'re on the negative side. I try and push them aside. I hope I\\'ll see something the reviewer didn\\'t see and have a better outcome. Unfortunately, that is not the case for \"Folie á Deux\".My concluding thoughts on the film were, \"man what a waste.\" The first \"Joker\" film is amazing. It\\'s fun, exciting, and you have someone to root for. This movie is utterly boring and useless. It\\'s not funny. It\\'s depressing and not memorable. It lacks actual character, and I feel like it gives me no one to root for.While some could argue that the soundtrack is good, I personally think it\\'s a distraction. Every time a musical number comes up, just as I was beginning to enjoy a sequence, I felt like the winds in the sail were blown out because it takes away from the pacing of the film. I personally think the musical numbers should\\'ve been worked in with something happening on screen pertinent to the movie.I\\'m indifferent to Joaquin Phoenix in this one. He definitely sold the depressing aspect of the film, but scenes where there should\\'ve been energy, he definitely lacked. Lady Gaga feels like she\\'s just trying to salvage her career. I don\\'t know if she\\'s still producing music, but there was a lacklustre performance from her. She\\'s also the only reason I believe this film was a musical. If she\\'s not in it then I think it would\\'ve been a normal film.Overall, it\\'s a long two hours of nothingness. The ending is atrocious and the beginning is forgettable. The middle is dredged by an ebb and flow of enjoyable film interspersed with terribly paced musicals. Also, it was difficult to understand the spoken word at times in general. Mix that with a musical and sometimes I was hoping I didn\\'t miss anything important. If I knew then what I now, I would\\'ve definitely waited for the film to hit a digital stream. For me it\\'s not even worth going on a cheap night, nor if someone was willing to pay for my ticket to go just to keep them company. But I can\\'t keep you from going so the choice is always yours....That\\'s it for now. Thanks for taking time to read my review. Happy watching and enjoy the show!',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux hardly tries to be cohesive in its Story, but then ironically interferes the story with long Musical sequences without giving them context or combining them into the plot.Funny how The Joker has nothing to do with the films story, it is about the actions of the Joker that happened prior. Joker is a passive character and we learn nothing new about him, the development he has is that he realizes he doesn't want to be the Joker anymore, which does not a single bit represent the character we've seen in the last film. It rather represents a commentary about the critics and audiences that looked at Joker from a morally questionable standpoint. And of course, Joker can't do what Joker does anymore because that would hurt the Image of the Filmmaker. Or should I say the Studio?The point is that this film plays it safe. Joker doesn't blow up things, he doesn't play games, he isn't on the verge of becoming Gothams biggest threat, he isn't the Joker. He's just Arthur. And I am watching this film to experience the embracement of The Joker that Arthur develops throughout the story, which unfortunately doesn't happen...Joaquin Phoenix does his best but it isn't enough to make this Character fully fleshed out. Even Lady Gaga, which has no depth to her character, doesn't serve the story a single bit. There is nothing they discover about each other, there is no room for development in these two. They have no chemistry together because Harley being in Arthur's Life doesn't change anything about his character. The same goes for her.The courtroom scenes have their moments, but all these moments do is referencing the first movie.I can understand that these musical scenes should give us a glimpse of Joker's mind, but there is nothing f-d up about these sequences beside a few things. The mind of the Joker is way more disturbing than dancing and singing happily.And yes, The Filmmaking and the score is great in every single scene, but it does not help when the picture releases no emotions inside of you.Yes, it is logical for Arthur to defend himself in court. Yes it's a more realistic take on the relationship of Harley and Joker. But depth is not existing. Realism without Depth and meaning means nothing.That said, I would rather have an illogical story that is thematically strong, than an story that makes sense but is thematically shallow.\",\n",

       "    'Review': '\"Joker:Folie a Deux\" is a sequel that they never really thought of making. Only after the vast popularity of \"Joker\" have they given it a thought of making a sequel. The thing is this movie doesn\\'t really connect. Its biggest issue is that at its core it doesn\\'t really know the story it wants to tell. Joaquin Phoenix returns as the titular character but there are moments here where he feels less grant than the original movie. Lady Gaga is criminally underused. Although they almost filmed it like a musical, Lady Gaga sings less than Phoenix. It also plays as romance,and sometimes as a court room drama. The truth is the movie is a little bit of all of those genres and that\\'s not bad. What is bad though is how they never really understood how to navigate all these genres to make a coherent story. The movie ends and you feel numb but you really have to try a lot to see how everything that happened falls in place in the story. The themes do come together at the end, but it should have been a more coherent storytelling. \"Joker:Folie a Deux\" is a long underwhelming sequel. It goes to show that Phillips\\' Joker was only good for what he already showed us before.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"So I'll start like most reviews I've seen for this film by starting with that i loved the first one. That was a superb slow burner of a film that built up to an amazing climax and was full of memorable scenes and quotes.Trying to pull it off twice was a tall order but I didn't quite expect it to go this way.The film is set two years after the first one with Arthur Fleck locked up and awaiting his trial and, while in there, meets Lee Quinn in a musical therapy group.The first flaw, for me, was that this really isn't much of a storyline to sustain a film well over two hours, it's just too long! It really does drag in parts.Secondly Todd Phillips can dress it up all he likes but this is definitely a musical. Now admittedly it isn't as bad as I thought. It's not like they're singing every two minutes and at first some of the musical scenes actually work but after a while they started to grate on me.The performances from everyone are superb except for Steve Coogan who makes a completely unnecessary appearance as Alan Partridge with an American accent.There's another brilliant film in here somewhere but it just gets too bogged down in its own self indulgence. The wacky opening scene was annoying and just added, like lots of other uneeded bits, to an already too long run time.I get where they were going with this at times, and it was almost clever, but it didn't quite come together for me but nice try anyway.I did get a kick out of characters, from the original, turning up in court to discuss how Arthur's behaviour affected them and I liked the use of a couple of locations from the first film.Sadly it just fails to build on the first film. There's no stand out moments, like Joker dancing down the steps outside his apartment or the wonderful dialogue on The Murray Franklin Show, you almost feel like it's going to happen and then it falls flat.Despite all that in a year full of let down sequels this, at least, wasn't completely terrible. I will definitely give it another watch to see how it works without my expectations up. But for now I shall sit on the fence and say that despite the fact it wasn't brilliant it also wasn't quite as bad as feared by early negative reviews so it's middle diddle for Joker Folie a Deux with a 5/10.\",\n",

Also the repeatabily of the scenes in jail is just boring and it adds-up to the already exosting songs . To add up this movie is not about the Joker . Arthur becomes Joker only for a couple of scenes and the switch between Arthur\\'s two characters is too steep . To be honest though the \"secret\" meanings of the movie are good and delivered superbly . For me the only people that should see this movie are the ones that havent seen the first one although I would suggest watching the first one instead .

       "    'Review': 'So, before watching this movie, I rewatched Joker (2019) and I loved it. It is one of my favuote DC movies ever. Possibly my 3rd fav. But it felt like a standalone to me. So I didn\\'t seem to care too much about potential sequals. But when I first saw the trailer scene of Joker dancing with Lady Gaga, I thought it looked awesome. Even though it was confirmed to be a muwsical, I was pretty open minded. The first 40 mins of this film is actually pretty good, and I was confuseed as to why people hated the film. Some musical scenes were decent. But as we got into the 2nd and 3rd act, I started to understand the HATE. It is so slow, messy and boring. The biggest joe of the film (no oun intended) is that it is so boring. HOW DO YOU MAKE A BORING FILM WITH TWO OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHARACTERS IN ALL OF DC? The middle act went on and on and I was BORED. The final act did capture my attention, but it all felt meaningless. While I do understand what Todd Phillips was trying to do with the ending, it falls flat on it\\'s face when the movie seems so unfocused. I didn\\'t care for the ending as I didn\\'t even enjoy the majority of the movie. Very underwhelming and a bit dissapointing. I don\\'t recommend wasting your time watching this. But if you are curious, then please, go check it out. Overall, I will rate it 5/10. It is a \"MEH\" Movie.',\n",

Riding the tidal wave from the first film. Show me a VILLAIN. Instead the whole film was confused, frustrating, boring and weak.

However, Lady Gaga\\'s character doesn\\'t allow her to fully explore her range, which feels like a missed opportunity given her talent.

       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is a film that finds itself in the middle and balances between being good or bad, in other words it is \"decent\" or \"so-so\". By adding the musical genre, the script is strange to the concept presented in the first film, and does not have that avant-garde element that director Todd Phillips hoped to capture. The script touches on interesting elements about a social idol, who creates a cult and who, by presenting himself as he really is, divides opinions among his fans, apart from this, the script fails to go further. The cinematography is good being the strong point of the film. The musical numbers manage to be of mixed quality, there are good ones and bad ones. The production level is high, making it the most notable positive point of this sequel. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance declines compared to the first film and Lady Gaga achieves a good role that loses intensity in the plot. Todd Phillips\\' work as director is very average on this occasion. \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is a film with ups and downs that works in some scenes.',\n",

In any case, the music is great as are the others in supporting roles. Nothing was left of Gotham or the story of Batman, and in comparison to the first film about the Joker, everything that held the story together was missing. The film is worth watching for the excellent costumes, mask, camera and close-ups of the two main actors that keep you awake until this hour too long film is over.

At times it looked like the story could go in the direction of exploring Joker/Arthurs psyche, to then suddenly turn the focus onto Gaga's character or another unfitting song. Other times the story would look like it was going towards Joker and Harley having the comic book relationship many would've liked to see (done better than suicide squad) on the big screen, to again ripping it out from under the audience. From the outside it seemed like the writers just wanted to write a surreal, whimsical musical, and forgot to have an actual fulfilling story.All in all, the movie had loads of beautiful cinematogrophy done by Lawrence Sher, the usual impressive acting by phoenix, and a surprisingly good performance by Lady Gaga.

       "    'Review': \"After the masterpiece that the first Joker film was, I waited for the sequel to be even more amazing-especially with the intriguing subtitle, Folie à Deux, hinting at a deep dive into the shared madness between two characters. Unfortunately, what I got instead was a film that left me feeling profoundly underwhelmed.Yes, the acting is undeniably strong. Joaquin Phoenix continues to deliver his methodical, unsettling portrayal of Arthur Fleck, and Lady Gaga shows real potential as Harley Quinn. Both actors gave it their all, but the material they were working with left much to be desired. The script gave them little room to explore the complexity of their characters. In contrast to the first Joker-a dark psychological thriller that masterfully peeled back the layers of Fleck's mind-the sequel felt hollow, relying more on style than substance.The decision to make Joker: Folie à Deux a musical was certainly not the best choice. In theory, I can understand wanting to inject something new into the sequel to avoid being a carbon copy of the original, but the genre shift felt really out of place considering how Joker was lauded for its haunting, psychological approach to topics like mental illness and societal breakdown.Lady Gaga, was clearly cast to showcase her acting chops, not just her vocal skills. So why lean so heavily into the singing? It felt as though the filmmakers were more interested in creating an extravagant showcase for her musical abilities than allowing her to fully inhabit the darker, twisted persona of Harley Quinn. Her acting moments showed promise, but the movie never gave her the space to explore her character in a way that felt authentic or emotionally resonant.In the end, Joker: Folie à Deux feels like a missed opportunity. It lacks the raw, nerve-wracking intensity of its predecessor and tries to compensate with flashy musical numbers and surreal set-pieces. But beneath that glittery surface, there's not much to hold on to. The psychological depth that made the original Joker such a profound and unsettling experience is largely absent here, replaced by spectacle.\",\n",

Having known all of this prior, I truly can't understand what people we're expecting? I set my bar for the movie extremely low. I'm not a comics or superhero movie fan, which is why the first Joker felt like a breath of fresh air. If I have to see another A list actor on steroids in tights I'm gonna gouge my eyes out. Go watch one of the billion superhero movies that follow cliche cookie cutter formulas, rehashing the same stories over and over ad nauseum if you don't like these interpretations? Like I said, I didn't have high expectations from the get go, I hate virtually all musicals I've ever seen. This seemed like an experiment. I respect director's taking risks, even if the final vision falls somewhat short. Keeps art alive. That being said, I think Joker: Folie à Deux slightly surpassed my (already very low) expectations as A MOVIE. The reality is that I will watch any movie JP is starring in, even if the movie seems bad. I watch Joaquin for what he brings to each performance, more than I generally care about the director or their movies. Joaquin brings a vulnerability, honesty, raw/realness to every performance and always impresses me with how he interprets roles. Was the movie amazing? Definitely not. Was it decently entertaining for a sequel that is a musical? Absolutely.I will admit that I kind of zoned out during most of the singing parts.... but the acting in between was great and the story was decent imo.\",\n",

However, in its defence I found it wasn't quite as dreadful as anticipated.First, let's talk positives: the cinematography effectively captured the grimness of Arkham Asylum. I found the slow-burning storyline intriguing. Although not much happens, the visual storytelling kept me engaged-at least until we hit the courtroom scenes.Now for the downsides. The film is peppered with random musical numbers that feel entirely out of place. It seems this turned into a vanity project for Lady Gaga, with Joaquin Phoenix's involvement coming off as delusional and egotistical. Some scenes were outright cringeworthy, with Phoenix looking visibly embarrassed while dancing in the dreary asylum. A few dream sequence musical numbers might have been tolerable, but this was overkill.The film's portrayal of the Joker's infatuation with Lee is another misstep. He comes across as old, tired, beaten, and weird. Lee doesn't appear crazy enough to be obsessed with him. Additionally, the courtroom scenes drag on unnecessarily. The oscillation between Joker's ego, Arthur Fleck's beaten demeanor, and the genius-crazy Joker is hard to believe.In summary, *Joker 2* is a disappointing sequel that attempts to be clever and unique but ends up being ridiculous and muddled.\",\n",

This was very similar to fan complaints of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) being too much like Star Wars: A New Hope (1977). So, for the second installment in that series, Rian Johnson made some bold and divisive choices. The difference between the choices made by Johnson then, and Todd Phillips now, is that the choices Johnson made had legs. Whether you liked The Last Jedi (2017) or not you can admit that the movie had bold ideas, but these ideas were also interesting. The same can not be said for Joker Folie a Deux.Making a super villain movie a musical is indeed a bold move, however, nothing was done to make it an interesting move/movie. For it to be a strong idea, the musical elements of the film have to land or at least be memorable. Cycling through the Best of the 50s and 60s isn't a bold musical choice. If you're going to go full musical, which this is, put some time into making original songs.Remove all the music from Folie a Deux and what do you have? A two hour slog split between Arkham Asylum and the courtoom. The few moments where Joaquin Phoenix is allowed to cook (doing a Foghorn Leghorn voice in court) are some of the few bright spots in the film. Otherwise, this was an ambitious undertaking that isn't even interesting enough to be polarizing.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'There is actually a good movie in there somewhere but Why did they have to cut away 15 times to stupid ensembles that contributed nothing to the movie, it was nothing but an unwelcome distraction. Was there not enough time to write the script so they had to fill it with songs?Parts of the movie were enjoyable with some sort of resemblance to what made the first movie so popular. However everytime I began to enjoy it another song popped up and by the end of the movie it actually began to feel like torture. It gets a 5 out of 10 for the small bits of the movie we did get to see. Hopefully a version gets released without the cutaway to annoying singing scenes, even if it will only be about 45mins long.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"I feel conflicted about Joker: Folie à Deux. As someone who loved the first Joker, I went into the sequel with some concerns, especially after hearing mixed reviews. Now that I've seen it, I'm still processing how I feel.I'll start with the musical aspect. I'm not a fan of musicals, and while this movie didn't change my opinion, it didn't bother me as much as I expected. The musical numbers felt integrated into the story, but they didn't elevate the experience for me either. And there weren't as many musical moments as I feared.Visually, Folie à Deux is just as stunning as the first movie. Todd Phillips once again proves he knows how to create beautiful, immersive sets and craft visually memorable scenes. The film's aesthetic is one of its strongest elements.Joaquin Phoenix remains fantastic as Arthur Fleck. His performance continues to be a highlight, and even though I didn't love certain aspects of the story, he fully embodies the character once again. However, one thing that bothered me throughout the movie was that Arthur's character arc didn't feel like it moved forward. Instead, the film seemed more focused on giving us a retrospective look at Arthur, almost trying to reverse or undermine the progress of his journey from the first movie. Maybe trying to hard to antagonize certain aspects of the audience who really liked the first one.Then there's Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn. While she's undoubtedly talented and adds to the plot, her character felt underutilized and a bit forgettable. She has the voice for the musical moments, but Harley herself isn't fully fleshed out, which left me wanting more from her portrayal.The film's ending also left me a bit infuriated. I personally think the movie would have been better if it had ended about 10 minutes earlier. The ending we got really made the first two hours seem rather pointless.Overall, Folie à Deux isn't as bad as some people say, but the first movie is miles ahead of this one. It is thought-provoking, and either way, whether you thought it was good or bad, you will be passionate about your feelings about it. But the sequel didn't capture the same magic, and by the end, I think it would have been better if Joker hadn't gotten a second movie at all.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'The original Joker has been categorized as a \"psychological thriller\" and this movie has been categorized as a \"musical psychological thriller.\" The theater listing categorizes the movie singularly as \"suspense.\" Let\\'s be clear. There is no mystery, suspense, or thriller here. And aside from brief acts of violence, there is no action. I agree with critics that call this a \"quasi-musical courtroom drama.\"Avoiding pre-release marketing, as I do, I had no idea I was in store for a musical. The movie \"boasts\" 15 musical numbers, oddly, only 4 less than West Side Story (1961). That said, the singing was intentionally fashioned to be \"unprofessional.\" So there\\'s that. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s singing voice sounds like Randy Newman on a bad day.To be fair, Phoenix delivers a tour-de-force performance as he did in the original. However, the feature length movie built out from it is a vapid house of cards with no true \"plot\" to speak of.The courtroom footage was dry and befuddling at best. And to say that Zazie Beetz \"reprises\" her role from the original movie is disingenuous as it\\'s no more than about 5 minutes of testimony.Phoenix is imprisoned for the ENTIRETY of the movie, and, inexplicably, Lady Gaga is seemingly allowed to come and go as she pleases.Most of the musical numbers are sung \"in fantasy\" and some seemingly (but not conclusively) \"out of fantasy.\"Frankly, then, the movie is not a satisfying musical or courtroom drama or thriller. It\\'s more akin to a clumsy campy misguided version of La La Land.',\n",

You take a character like Joker and you put him one of the most boring settings, a courtroom, and that's where most of the major scenes take place! Where's the unpredictability? Where is Fleck interacting with the world that he created? Sowing the seeds of chaos that he planted in the first movie? DC continues to prove that they have no clue what to do with this character. And it's disappointing to say the least. You're better off watching Batman the Animated Series reruns and the Dark Knight at least that Joker is menacing and a credible threat.

While the original film provided a deep and unsettling look into the psyche of Arthur Fleck and his transformation into the iconic villain, this installment seems to lack that same focus. Instead of building on the character's mental unraveling, the movie distracts itself\\nwith songs that don't seem to fit the narrative or enhance the story in any meaningful way. The plot feels disjointed and fails to capture the raw emotion and tension that made the first Joker film so compelling.The majority of the scenes come across as incoherent, lacking a clear direction or purpose. For much of the runtime, it's difficult to understand what the movie is trying to achieve, and the pacing feels uneven. The only moment that truly stands out is the final second of the film, which delivers a payoff that might resonate with hardcore fans of the DC Universe. However, for those who are not well-versed in the intricacies of the DC lore, even this moment may leave viewers feeling confused or unsatisfied.In summary, Joker 2024 doesn't capture the same depth or tension as its predecessor. Its reliance on unrelated musical choices and a plot that only makes sense to those deeply familiar with DC's background diminishes what could have been a powerful continuation of the Joker's story.\",\n",

Manipulation to his best by the director.Great performances as expected and it's a very believable story in the Joker world that's what matters, don't go away from what he his. Ofc this isn't any build up to a crazy Batman universe so you need to see this as a musical and with some understanding of who is the Joker, if you can't see the movie thinking you're in his feet's but you're just there to consume wathever is in front of you then it's not worth.For the fans of the Joker I think it's a great movie, for people that don't have any idea of who he his or just want some crazy action like its usual in super heroes movies, don't waste time.\",\n",

The shifts in tone were confusing, and one could even argue that they indirectly ruined the film. Phoenix's Oscar-worthy performance remains as extraordinary as ever, while Gaga, compared to her roles in A Star Is Born and House of Gucci, came across as a bit lackluster. But it's not her fault-the issue lies in how her character was written. Her singing ability is beyond doubt, her performance seemingly effortless, and her voice very moving, but in the musical scenes, Phoenix clearly couldn't match her.As a Batman fan, I couldn't feel any chemistry between Joker and Harley. Instead of Harley being the leading lady, it felt more like she was just a tool to drive the plot forward-and that plot was incredibly disappointing, especially if you loved the first film. The first movie showcased how a person from the bottom of society, bullied, oppressed, ridiculed, and tormented by various illnesses and childhood traumas, was slowly pushed into darkness and eventually descended into madness. In the second film, however, the focus was more on his confusion about himself and his uncertainty in facing the public's expectations. Sure, you managed to overthrow the city and start a revolution, but the crowd only idolized the symbol you represented. Once you take off the mask, no one cares about the real you. While the movie's message was still profound, the execution fell flat.The first movie, in my mind, was flawless, a 10/10 masterpiece. But this second one? I can only give it a 5/10. It was that bad and that disappointing, and I sincerely wish they had never made a sequel.That being said, I'm really glad I spent last weekend on a long road trip, looping Lady Gaga's latest album Harlequin at least ten times. It gave me some sense of connection to the musical elements in this film.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'I don\\'t like musicals, never have. I don\\'t like the music and I don\\'t like that everything\\'s always so incredibly over the top happy, I don\\'t like that apparently everyone always knows all the songs and the dance moves and they just drop everything to ... sing and dance, almost as if their lives depended on it (this might make a fun horror movie). So when I heard that the sequel to \"Joker\" would be a musical, I was very disappointed. In the end I still watched it because I really enjoyed the first movie and a sequel, even a musical sequel, couldn\\'t be that bad, right?I\\'ve read complaints about the movie not using original songs. My reply to those: Originals songs wouldn\\'t have worked. The songs in \"Folie à Deux\" actually have a point - I still didn\\'t like them (not a genre of music I enjoy) but they actually fit the overall tone - without spoiling anything, this really is the Joker we know from the first movie but he\\'s singing - and they never felt disruptive, which sets the movie apart from the few other musicals I\\'ve seen (glimpses of). There\\'s even a scene that I enjoyed (Joker and the courtroom #1).The image in IMAX was great (volume warning for the sentence!), Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga do a good job and while the sequel is sadly a lot tamer than the first one, it\\'s still not even close to PG-13. So why the bad rating (I guess you could see 5 stars as a neutral rating)?Do you remember the TV shows from the late 2000s and early 2010s? 20+ episodes per season, 20-40 minutes each. Eventually they couldn\\'t come up with a new story, so they did a filler episode. Sometimes this was a flashback episode, sometimes it was a musical, sometimes it just had the characters running around in circles. \"Folie à Deux\" is the latter. The movie is almost 140 minutes long but there\\'s basically no progress to the overall \"Joker\" story. Don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s not boring (for me at least, others who expect a \"true\" sequel might feel a different way) but, apart from introducing Harleen and Harvey Dent, and a tiny origin story, there\\'s no point to it. It\\'s a movie that feels as if it wants to set up another sequel but it barely even does that.The ending of \"Joker\" felt satisfying, the ending of \"Folie à Deux\" just left me asking: \"What now? This can\\'t be it, right? Where\\'s the rest?\"',\n",

       "    'Review': 'I wish I could erase this movie from my brain so that I can enjoy the first movie without knowing the disappointing way the story concludes.The first joker film showed us Arthur\\'s journey from a victim of society, downtrodden and unloved, to his own hero who finally passes his breaking point and learns to stand up for his own beliefs. He finally has confidence, love and self respect and all of his restraints have snapped.Folie a Deux seems to undo all of that character development and turns him back into victim who will never be able to break free. A theme of the movie is whether the Joker is real or whether he is just a fantasy or figment and the moral of the story appears to be that Arthur will always be just Arthur and nothing more.The songs add very little to the plot and some seem misplaced as if they\\'ve been forced in to the story despite holding almost no relevance.The plot is incredibly basic and moves nothing forward. Arthur attends court hearings while dating Lee. It seems as though it purposefully makes no sense like it\\'s a nod to Arthur\\'s joke \"I hope my death makes more cents that my life.\" At one point Gaga\\'s character, Lee, tells Arthur to stop taking his meds as though there is something planned for him or his rescue but it\\'s never mentioned again and is only relevant to show that Lee only really loves him when he\\'s the Joker rather than himself.They add strange social commentaries for example Gary from his work in the first movie testifying that Arthur has caused him the same fear that Arthur once felt, as if trying to blatantly point out that evil begets evil, but it just comes across as a bit bizarre and irrelevant.They also add more information about his mother mocking him to others which seems out of character for how his mother was played in the first movie as though they only added it to make something, anything, happen within the plot.Phoenix and Gaga do a fabulous job and are the high point of the movie but they\\'re really not given much of a script to work with. The relationship between the characters isn\\'t really explored and there is no Folie a Deux present. Gaga\\'s character fangirls over Joker and they begin a romance. The relationship doesn\\'t go any further, they don\\'t become any kind of chaos causing team-up, they just date a bit while Arthur attends court like she\\'s a groupie which is a disappointment. The relationship between them could have been fascinating if the appropriate time had been spent on it rather than their main on screen time together being during dance sequences.All in all the movie falls flat. Worth a watch once but once is enough.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Saw Joker 2 today.Someone behind me as I was leaving the cinema summed it perfectly - 'It's not as impactful as the first.'The first Joker was a gritty, uncompromising, nasty, tension filled and utterly unique look at a man's mental illness. Joker 2 undoubtedly shares those same qualities but to a far lesser degree, failing to reach the lofty heights of it's predecessor.Joker 2 though isn't bad - it just feels as if it's lost it's way. I totally clicked with the intentions, themes and messages of the first movie whereas in Joker 2 I can't honestly say I felt the same way. I was left confused by what the film was trying to say to me.What Joker 2 does do is greatly expand on the character of Arthur Fleck, yet strangely not in a way that felt satisfying. I kept wanting to know more or connect emotionally but the reality is I couldn't. I understood but I just didn't care. Joker built the character of Arthur Fleck up whilst Folie A Deux knocks the character right back down.The stand out of Joker 2 are the performances. Phoenix is pitch perfect again as Fleck (if sightly less menacing) whist Gaga is not a bad choice as Harley but here is where one of my biggest points against the film stands - I didn't like their relationship. I felt it didn't really build or develop as naturally as it should and it definitely didn't go the way I expected it to. Although it's clearly not a film set in the typical Batman world, Folie A Deux felt like an outright betrayal of the lore of the world.Maybe I went into Joker: Folie A Deux with too many expectations. But a film can disappoint your expectations and still be an excellent film - but Joker: Folie A Deux isn't an excellent film. IGo in expecting something unlike anything you've ever seen before and you may be pleased. Go on expecting a decent sequel to Joker and you'll be disappointed. I unfortunately have to not recommend it.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'When you decide to make a sequel to what is arguably the best \"become villain\" film ever made, you\\'re probably very confident in what you\\'re doing. How confident Todd Phillips and the team were-I\\'ll try to break down in my fresh pre-premiere impressions with a bit more analysis. When the film was first announced as a musical, it instantly received a lot of backlash. You might have already noticed the hate has grown even more after the pre-release screenings. While some think it\\'s because of the musical aspect, I wouldn\\'t fully agree. My friend Tarik, who joined me in the packed IMAX theater, did protest by wincing at the start of each singing scene.The musical here operates largely on an abstract level, and as such, it\\'s visually very pleasing and aurally effective in the context of Joker and Harley\\'s \"madness for two.\" However, since most of the musical segments don\\'t really affect the plot, they feel unnecessary. The few songs integrated into the real-time narrative didn\\'t convince me of their purpose, leaving the overall musical component as passable but far from what a good film in that genre should be.Before diving into the plot elements without spoiling anything, I must address the film\\'s title, which is there purely as \"bait\" to get you into the theater and spend money on the film. \"Folie à Deux\" refers only to the abstract part of the film, so if you were expecting wild and murderous adventures of Harley and Joker, forget about it. As the trailers suggested, the plot takes place in a prison, two years after the chaotic events in Gotham when we watched Arthur Fleck\\'s transformation into Joker. Now, Joker is facing trial for what he\\'s done, making the majority of the film a courtroom drama. But we\\'ve all seen good courtroom dramas, and \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" functions quite well in that regard. The drama is tense, filled with great dialogue and, I must say, humor. The film carries a wonderfully subtle humor-at least that\\'s how I interpreted many scenes, though I can\\'t say for certain whether that was the director\\'s intent.Like the first part, this film boasts visually stunning shots, phenomenal acting from Joaquin Phoenix, decent performance from Lady Gaga, and top-tier set design. Harley Quinn, portrayed well by Gaga, has little impact on the plot, which didn\\'t sit well with me. On the other hand, Joker\\'s psychological development is notable, something I found impressive at first, but it eventually ruined the film for me. Despite its flaws, this was a good movie right up until the end. However, in the final third, the writers take a narrative turn that reduces Joker to just another average socially distorted character, rather than the symbol of nihilism, madness, and chaos that he has always been. This is a shallow, misguided, and, to use a colloquial term, idiotic choice by the writers, further exacerbated by the film\\'s conclusion. It\\'s unlikely to sit well with even the most hardcore fans, and I really wanted to like this film.In conclusion, \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is not only an inconsistent sequel but also a completely thoughtless approach to the core idea this story should represent, leaving a bitter taste for all fans.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Rating is 6/10Watched on Sept. 30 2024 @ Fan First Premiere (First Watch)Format: (Digital) IMAXTodd Phillips repeats exactly what he did to The Hangover trilogy with Joker 2. The director goes on to make a sequel that is unfortunately empty and has no character development.Phillips outdone himself in directing a film that has an outstanding cinematography/visuals that portrays every feeling and emotion that it wants to tell and express. BUT, he failed in creating an engaging storyline. From a part one to a part two, usually the characters of the film change. Their arc either declines or inclines. Their personalities change. Events/obstacles come along their way to shift their lives. OR new character/s enter their life which opens the door for more interesting events to come along their way resulting in a \"Folie à Deux\". In this film, Joker\\'s/Arthur Fleck\\'s life doesn\\'t seem to change much as Gaga\\'s character, Lee, is added. Instead, the film keeps repeating its events by REvisiting the past (the first Joker film) or reacting some of its scenes. It also keeps coming back and forth to the same locations and events within this film itself. Resulting in an overall dull film that is ONLY visually entertaining.This film introduces two major characters within the Gotham world, Harvey Dent, who is played terribly by Harry Lawtey and written even worse. By the end of the film, I felt like he was useless and is taken advantage of because of his \\'name\\' within the comic books fandom. Same goes to Lady Gaga\\'s Lee that simply felt like it wasn\\'t even in this film.I enjoyed how this film uses music/songs to showcase that it\\'s an ESCAPE for our inner selves. But, the song choices weren\\'t on point. On the other hand, their performance was well done by Gaga or Joaquin Phoenix and Lawrence Sher\\'s cinematography skills.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker 2 attempts to once again dive into the mind of Arthur Fleck, but unfortunately, it treads too much of the same ground as the first film. The original Joker was such a meticulous and thorough character study that by the end, it felt like there was little left to uncover. That exact feeling haunts this sequel, as it struggles to find new dimensions to Arthur's complex psyche, leaving the film feeling more like an epilogue rather than a fresh narrative.Joaquin Phoenix, as expected, delivers an excellent performance as Arthur Fleck, further cementing his unsettling portrayal of the Joker. Lady Gaga also brings depth to her role as Harley Quinn, adding a new dynamic to Arthur's story. However, the movie continuously pulls away from their strong performances with unnecessary musical numbers and courtroom drama that feel out of place.Ironically, the movie feels its best when it alludes to the iconic scenes and atmosphere of the first film, rather than when it tries to experiment with new elements. The callbacks to Arthur's lonely and disturbed journey in the original film evoke the same eerie tension and emotional weight that made Joker so powerful. However, the attempts to add new layers with the courtroom drama and out-of-nowhere musical sequences ultimately detract from the story's flow, feeling more like distractions than meaningful additions.The film shines brightest when it focuses on the twisted and toxic relationship between Joker and Harley. The chemistry between Phoenix and Gaga adds a fascinating layer to the film, but unfortunately, these moments are too few and far between.Ultimately, Joker 2 feels more like a continuation that didn't have much more to say. While it has its highlights, particularly in its performances, the film feels like an unnecessary add-on to the first rather than a compelling new chapter. For fans of the original, it might feel redundant, offering little new exploration of Arthur's character or the world he inhabits.\",\n",

My actual rating would probably be around 4 or 5, but I\\'m giving it a 6 because I know this film is going to get a lot of negative votes, and it does have some merit.First off, it felt more like a musical promoting Lady Gaga\\'s \"new album\" than the dark psychological thriller I was expecting. Don\\'t get me wrong, Gaga is talented, and her performance was solid, but the excessive musical numbers really disrupted the mood. This isn\\'t the kind of film where I want to be pulled into a Broadway show mid-story.

The pacing dragged, and it lacked the intense energy that kept the original Joker engaging from start to finish.On the positive side, the cinematography was beautiful, and Joaquin Phoenix is still excellent as Arthur Fleck. The acting was there, no doubt about that. But even with these strong elements, something was off. The film felt overly long, and by the end, it just seemed to lose direction.In the end, Joker: Folie à Deux had its moments, but the musical direction and uneven pacing left me feeling underwhelmed.',\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': \"Folie d'un Seul\",\n",
       "    'Review': 'In 2019, Todd Phillips\\' \\'Joker\\' took the world by storm. A moody origin story for the infamous Batman villain- as well as a powerful examination of mental illness- the film grossed over a billion dollars at the box office, and is still the second highest grossing R-rated film of all time. Superbly acted and beautifully shot, the drama- inspired by the films of Martin Scorsese, most evidently \\'The King of Comedy\\' and \\'Taxi Driver\\'- received near unanimous praise, from viewers and critics alike.However, it was not without some critical controversy. Some writers, like Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair, suggested the film was overly sympathetic \"towards white men who commit heinous crimes.\" Others, such as Jim Geraghty of National Review, felt that it would encourage \"America\\'s angry, paranoid, emotionally unstable young men\" to commit crimes like the ones depicted in Phillip\\'s narrative.Despite this, most concede that the film acted as a poignant, cautionary tale; showing how a societal disregard for the vulnerable can create someone as dangerous as Arthur Fleck, aka: Joker. In this way, it was an important film, that actually had something to say (which the majority of Phillip\\'s previous directorial features largely hadn\\'t). This made it something of a rarity in the landscape of comic-book adaptations- as did the fact that Phillips never intended to follow it up with a sequel.A rarity and a gamble, for studios want a sure thing. Indeed, it must have been incredibly difficult to get Warner Brothers to pony up the dough for a dark, stand-alone comic book adaptation in the age of the Marvel movie; where certainty is measured by quips, meta-humour and familiarity. That Phillips got \\'Joker\\' made- combined with its whirlwind success- seemed to be a harbinger of sorts; heralding that smaller stories could be just as affecting and as successful as the juggernaut Marvel franchise; proving that not everything actually needs a sequel.However, in Hollywood need is dictated by profitability; and if anything makes over one billion at the box office, a sequel will surely follow whether viewers, or the filmmakers, necessarily feels one is really warranted.Hence \\'Joker: Folie à Deux,\\' which, if the original was a gamble, is like a game of Russian Roulette with half the chambers loaded: a very risky business indeed. Whereas the first \\'Joker\\' was a dark psychodrama following Arthur Fleck on his descent into madness, \\'Folie à Deux\\' is a musical, detailing Fleck\\'s struggles with his dual identity in the run up to his trial for murder, alongside his number one fan, fellow inmate and love interest Harleen \\'Lee\\' Quinzel.Off the bat, credit must be given to Phillips for taking such a risk and going in a new direction, genre-wise. He and fellow screenwriter Scott Silver could have easily rested on their laurels, simply remaking the first film all over again, knowing it was a blueprint for success (as has been happening with the Marvel movies since- what now feels like- the dawn of time). That they decided to make a musical of all things takes genuine guts and, while perhaps foolhardy, must be applauded. It\\'s a massive swing, that not many directors would take.A massive swing that doesn\\'t exactly result in a hit. The first film had an engaging, tightly plotted narrative, with a compelling central character whose story arc felt organic and real. The sequel feels scattershot in comparison, as if Phillips and Silver weren\\'t sure what to do with Fleck and Quinzel, nor in which direction their story should head. The musical numbers within- and the runtime seems to be at least 50% song and dance- are routinely strong and emotionally resonant, though often feel like padding.Phillips has stated that Fleck sings when he can\\'t find \"the words to say what he wants to say,\" though, to a cynical viewer, it seems that Fleck sings because Phillips and Silver realized their narrative was too slim to justify a runtime of two hours and eighteen minutes. Indeed, much of proceedings are centred on characters recounting events from the first film, or consist of direct flashbacks.In addition, the idea- hastily introduced at a late stage- that Fleck may not be comfortable being turned into an icon at the expense of his own personality is shoehorned into the cigarette-paper-thin veneer of a plot. This feels at odds with his established character as a whole and, especially, the ending of the first film. Furthermore, the trial sequence- bar an extended scene featuring Gary Puddles, the diminutive clown from the original- is surprisingly dull and forgettable.Having said that, the doomed central relationship between Fleck and Lee is a genuinely affecting one. There have been on screen relationships between arguably insane characters before- Mickey and Mallory in \\'Natural Born Killers\\' and Lula and Sailor in \\'Wild At Heart\\' come to mind- but rarely are they as grounded and as tender as Fleck and Lee\\'s. Had the narrative around them been stronger, or if he and Silver had been more assured with regard to the film\\'s message; Phillips would have had a great work on his hands.Unfortunately, as it is, \\'Folie à Deux\\' lacks enough substance to make its own mark, outside the shadow of its predecessor. This is not to say, however, that it doesn\\'t have anything going for it. As mentioned above, the musical numbers are heartbreakingly performed and expertly choreographed. A sequence involving a Sonny & Cher-style variety-show is a stand out, as well as a devastating moment when Fleck recites \\'Ne me Quitte pas\\' into a courthouse phone.Additionally, Mark Friedberg\\'s production design atmospherically creates a seedy, cold Gotham City, where hope is a rare commodity; and love even rarer. Moreover, Lawrence Sher\\'s striking cinematography recalls the first film, though his use of stylizations and colour makes \\'Folie à Deux\\' a distinct beast; more like the films of Gene Kelly than Martin Scorsese (that Sher has mentioned Francis Ford Coppola\\'s ill-fated musical \\'One from the Heart\\' as inspiration is unsurprising, though also bitterly ironic).Furthermore, the performances are all incredible. Joaquin Phoenix once again powerfully portrays the complexities of a damaged mind, and is electrifying. Intense, nuanced and sadly believable, he carries the film squarely on his shoulders. Lady Gaga does similarly fine work opposite him as Lee, credibly bringing to life a borderline psychotic with aplomb. The madness in her eyes is disconcerting, and she has rarely been better on film. She and Phoenix work well together, performing the various musical numbers masterfully, whether together or apart.In addition, Brendan Gleeson does typically sterling work as the sadistic prison guard Jackie Sullivan; elevating what many other actors would have played as a straight villain into one of the film\\'s more interesting characters. Catherine Keener impresses greatly as the film\\'s only real \\'good\\' character, Fleck\\'s lawyer Maryanne Stewart, while Harry Lawtey brings the smug DA Harvey Dent to life well; even if the character is as generic as cardboard.Moreover, Leigh Gill\\'s excellent, impassioned performance as Gary Puddles in the film\\'s best scene lingers long after the credits have rolled, while Zazie Beetz\\'s strong work as Fleck\\'s original love interest Sophie is similarly impressive. Both deserved more screen time. Contrastly, although Steve Coogan has made his bread-and-butter playing smarmy characters, from Alan Partridge to Tony Wilson, his stereotypical American accent as journalist Paddy Meyers is jarring; though he\\'s still effective.In conclusion, Todd Phillip\\'s \\'Joker: Folie à Deux\\' could potentially have been a great film, were it not for its weak narrative and familiar plotting. Where 2019\\'s \\'Joker\\' ran, it crawls, often straying into the drab territory of the underwhelming. Despite lush cinematography and terrific performances, it comes as a bitter let-down. Although the songs are admittedly well-performed, they fundamentally feel like filler in a film that doesn\\'t know what it wants to be. It is neither as clever nor as controversial as its predecessor and- in comparison, sadly- decidedly disappointing. In the end, although it took guts, why Phillips made the film as a musical is not a folie à deux, rather a folie d\\'un seul- which makes the joke on the audience.',\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': \"Phillips; A Director Who Doesn't Care For The Devoted Audience\",\n",
       "    'Review': \"Todd Phillips is a masterclass director, directing some of the highest grossing films of all times like The Hangover. Joker (2019) was no exception to this, being the highest grossing restricted movie of all time at time of release. I was lucky enough to snag two tickets to a premiere in my area for Joker: Folie a Deux, and I left the theatre more disappointed than I anticipated. All of the ingredients were there to make a good recipe, and somehow, this movie came out of the oven tasteful but insanely dry.The film follows Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) after the events of Joker (2019). He now has a devoted fanbase outside of his imprisonment at Arkham Asylum, and has even made friends with fellow guards and prisoners. Upon being upgraded to a minimum watch zone within the penitentiary, he meets Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga), a superfan who has devoted her life to following Arthur's mentality. Together, they devise a plan to get them both out of jail where they can eventually live a happy life together, but at the cost of putting the Gotham in danger.Heres what the movie does right: the direction and cinematography. Being a direction nerd, I was so taken aback by the beauty of some of the shots in this film. Please see this on the biggest screen you can. I saw it in an IMAX theatre and it was so beautiful to behold. Phillips knows exactly what he's doing with these shots and what they are adding to the story. Also, the performances. Gaga, as always, never fails to surprise me with her acting abilities. Phoenix, reprising his oscar-winning role, hasn't lost sight of the character at all, and once again wowed me, a similar, slightly less scared, feeling as when i left the theatre to Joker (2019). The production and scenic design were also great as always, but we knew that going in. Especially knowing that this is indeed a musical, they really went for it.Heres what I perhaps didn't like as much: 2 main factors. The musicality, and the script. I love a good musical; some of my favourite movies are musicals. In this movie, the music felt so forced and not needed. I got exactly what they were trying to do with the numbers, and some worked (If my friends could see me now, Oh when the saints). But a lot of them just felt like filler in a rather empty movie. Which brings it into the next major point, the script. This movie has no clue what it wants to be. Its mostly a courtroom drama that has an outcome anyone could see coming, and also jumps the shark with less than 10 minutes left in the runtime. Phillips doesn't trust the audience to have either seen the first one, nor follow any DC lore. Lee Quinzel, obviously an anagram for another very famous DC villain, feels completely underwritten in this movie. We have zero clue who she is and when we see her character for the final time, you still don't really have a clue who she is. Harvey Kent plays a pretty main role in this film, and anyone knowing batman knows exactly who Harvey Kent is, who he becomes, and what his intentions are. It wasn't shocking. Nothing surprised me with this movie, which is so sad because the first one left my spine tingling. That was the most unfortunate part once the credits started to roll.Overall, this movie is indeed watchable, but after coming off of such a high from the first movie, it leaves a sour taste in your mouth. It's not bad by any means, in fact, I enjoyed it more than I didn't. But I really dont think this movie got to the apex it needed to, but it got 70% there. I predict it will get big but not the levels of Joker (2019)\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"This movie had the potential to be a great follow-up to its predecessor, but unfortunately, it falls short in several areas. While Joaquin Phoenix once again delivers an outstanding performance, elevating every scene he's in, the rest of the film doesn't live up to the same standard. His portrayal of Arthur Fleck remains deeply compelling, and if it weren't for his commitment to the role, the film would have been much harder to sit through.The story, however, felt disjointed and left far too many questions unanswered. It seemed as though much of the narrative either stalled or was confined to the courtroom, creating a repetitive structure that lacked forward momentum. We barely learned anything new about the characters or their motivations, particularly Lee. There was so much potential to explore her backstory, but instead, her character felt one-dimensional, like she was just upset over a bad breakup, which felt underwhelming and incomplete.Lady Gaga's performance lacked the depth and emotional intensity that the role demanded, making her character feel flat and uninspiring. Given the complex, chaotic nature of the Joker's world, this lack of dynamism felt like a major missed opportunity.Overall, this movie could have been great. With Joaquin Phoenix's talent and the rich potential of the Joker character, there was a real chance to dive deep into compelling, gritty storytelling. Instead, the movie opted for a repetitive plot and underdeveloped characters, making it fall short of its potential.\",\n",

I love the experience of watching a creation like this on a Dolby big screen but I was so confused the whole time as when will stuff start blowing up and the action begin?This movie does not really satisfy the expectations that was built from the first one. It is not crazy, it's not madness, it's just odd drama. Half the scenes are a creation of Arthur Fleck's (The Joker) imagination and my sister actually argues that the whole things was a dream!One thing I like about this movie is Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn, and the singing really added a new exciting element to the movie (Sinatra fan here). It's a pity the story just wasn't there to support it. It's worth a watch anyway just don't expect a lot.\",\n",

I still remember the goosebumps I had once I was done with the 2K19 version, not to mention the standing ovation crowd gave to Joaquin's performance that completely shattered everyone's impression that Heath Leager's joker depiction cannot be equalled.Just like Dark Knight trilogy I expected the creator to take this franchise a knot above but they completely failed everyone's expectations. Even Joaquin's performance and epic background score weren't enough to save this sequel. Lady Gaga is underutilised and is there in the movie just for the songs. Folie à Deux completely diminishes the legacy of Joker. Why make a musical to an epic and ruin the anticipation of fans???Although I would say it's a visual masterpiece, with many scenes that will make long lasting impression especially the one where Phoenix is escorted by prison guards and it starts raining and all guards open their umbrellas which are of different colors and Phoenix is standing in the middle drenching in the rain. These scenes will make you think how great this movie could have been.A huge disappointment for sure!!!\",\n",

Those who paid to see it shelled out $17. I would NOT recommend spending that much money. Also, I can't think of anything that happened on screen that justifies IMAX.I appreciated how they incorporated the musical elements. I wouldn't call it a musical in the Broadway sense, although there were some nods to that. The songs did reflect the emotions of the characters and weren't just plopped in to do musical numbers.The story does pick up from the first movie. In fact, several of the questions about the first movie were answered satisfactorily (at least to me). Unfortunately, I think this diminished the mystique (at least to me) of Joker himself. I did not care about him, or his journey, as much as I did in the first movie.I've got to say, though, that this ain't your Hollywood ending. Something is thrown in in the last scene that dropped my jaw.This isn't a movie you go to to be entertained. It provokes thought and discussion. At this screening, a group in the first row turned around and asked the rest of the audience what we thought. I put my head down and walked out because I wasn't sure what I thought. I'm still trying to figure it out. That makes it a movie worth seeing but not for full price.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"It feels like Todd Phillips hates that people really liked the first movie. It's as if he thought that anyone that liked Joker wanted to BE Joker. No Todd, the audience is smarter than that. You made an interesting empathetic character where we learn how a man could commit such evil acts. You feel bad for Arthur but we're not excusing his actions. Yet, some of those that didn't like the first thought you were promoting that behavior. Maybe, don't listen to the people that misunderstood your first movie Todd because it seems like that rhetoric steered your decision making in this sequel.Technically, this movie does a lot right. The acting, score, cinematography, etc. Is all good. Heck, even a couple of the musical numbers are good. The idea of a musical has some potential, while not necessarily a take I'd go, a couple parts show how it could have been very interesting. The movie never commits to it though. So most of the singing feels routine and dull. Ultimately, the writing drags this movie down.Obviously, there was no plan for a direct sequel to Joker, but it was a huge success, therefore WB offers a big paycheck to Todd Phillips to make a sequel. So he creates a movie that no fan of the first movie wanted. Todd gets the last laugh because he's now richer and the punchline is the audience who spent their money to see this movie he knew most wouldn't like. Get it, it's meta, you shouldn't like this stuff, not what you expected, gotcha!\",\n",

They were self aware, stopping short of dragging on and giving an additional dimension madness amongst the looming destruction.The performances are solid all round. The pacing is calculated, allowing us contemplation on Arthur's character and what his new relationship with Quinzel will mean.However, despite what seems like a broiling build up to a cacophony of insanity, this film ultimately bails at its last hurdles and even puts to bed any expectations that another sequal could be the explosive conclusion to a trilogy. Where the original topped off with a bold and manacing statement, this one pulls away. Yet again, this seems entirely self aware. It's a subversion tactic that no one expected but no one wanted, either.We wanted Joker. We got Arthur Fleck.\",\n",

Me personally, I not only didn't mind the singing but I believe it did nothing to hurt the film. All in all, it was an enjoyable watch but given its predecessors success as a masterpiece with Oscar awards, it's no question why people are bashing on this film.

Probably would have been best just to call this joint the Clown and leave Batman's Rogue out of it.Funny thing is there was a lot of potential to appeal to Fanboys, but they did not take it, in a move that felt pompous on the filmmaker's side. If you hate comic book superhero movies that much then why'd you do one?I did not hate Lady Gaga's version of Harley Quinn, in fact overall her connecting story arch with the joker made this movie worth seeing, but still, this is not the original DC animated Universe version or the comic book version. Truly, this is someone else who may have been better received in another movie.And to think, my biggest worry going in is that i hate musicals and hoped if Gaga was doing some of it I would tolerate it. Not even worth mentioning it! It does not make sense why it even needed to be a musical. Were the musical ques met to metaphorically allow me to enter the heads of the two main characters or was it a poorly done trick to make a film seem artier and more interesting? Definitely both!Sometimes lighting can't strike twice and the funniest thing about this film is how far from the mark they missed it!Don't sit through this.\",\n",

I don't mind the singing/music, I think a few were out of place, but otherwise okay to give atmosphere.So the main character was missing - Fleck's development was a psychologically, exciting drive in Joker (2019), and there was also action, but here things almost came to a standstill.So basically lack of action - and the absence of the main character in Joker-apperance.The acting was great, but the screenplay nothing like the first movie.Was this a villain in a superhero movie from Gotham city?

If anyone watched the interviews and with Tod Philips mentioning he had NO PLANS of making a 2nd film neither did Joaquin.But they took a different approach and honestly to me who loves the first this movie makes perfect sense.Some ask where the story is? Are you even watching? Or are you just criticizing every scene and not letting yourself go?Anyone knows the comics and these two relationship shouldn\\'t have expected anything different or new.It\\'s a live action, dark comedy, drama, crime and psychological film.He was captured and put into Arkham Asylum/Hospital in the end of the last one.This shouldn\\'t be news to anyone that you are viewing someone\\'s life via an insane asylum for an entire movie and getting their perspective. The musical elements are mentioned as to why they are used in the movie as well at Harley\\'s class, they use music for a form of therapy and it makes sense.The entire movie is his life in the asylum lost and trying to cope with whatever his life was. Then he finds love and has meaning again in his life and they use a musical to portray his feelings and her\\'s. They are both in a hospital and playing out their fantasies for the most part in their minds so why does that not seem like a good way to approach it?It builds up towards the third act and the last bit is super sad but when and IF you can open your mind and realize these are mental health patients expressing themselves then maybe you will understand and appreciate the movie better.I\\'m so sick and tired of movies getting hate and people find like 1 thing to make it sound like the entire movie is ruined because of it.I don\\'t care for musicals but I do for dark ones such as Sweeney Todd with Johnny Depp. If you enjoyed that one then you\\'ll enjoy Joker 2.This film almost could have been a stand alone to if it didn\\'t rely on repeating his crimes from the first film because even Arthur Fleck said he is done focusing on his past.Anyways that\\'s my two cents.

I don't know what your problem is, but chill out.The film was inconsistent, but the acting perfromances, Gleeson in particular, are what in my opinion set this movie from being average, to being a decent film. There's a lot of bad film. A lot of over the top super hero movies. It's almost refreshing to see a played out villain story where we expect so many things due to our familiarity with the adapted literature, turned into a boring court room drama with some musical components. Really subverted my expectations, and I found myself laughing at just the idea of that, which is genius, because the production company, had to know this would piss off so many nerds and incels and low iq americans who devour action movies like cheesburgers.The movie wasn't deep, im not saying that, but i did enjoy the critism of american symbolisation and fanaticism. I didn't love it, but I enjoyed my viewing. I tend to not love musicals and I didn't really like the first joker, but this one was funnier, more tragic, and a good fall date night movie to share and drink beers to.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Going by most reviews you may think this movie is worse than cancer...Coming out of the cinema theater, I\\'m no different from, perhaps, thousand other moviegoers who consider 2019 Joker a cinematic event in both themes and artistry.However, here in 2024, Joker 2: Folie à Deux Director Todd Phillips comes back with an idea that could\\'ve / should\\'ve been genius - what if Arthur Fleck\\'s Joker is the inspiration of the true Joker?This approach tries to break free from repetition when compared to any other comic film. The problem is, and this is the biggest oversight in Phillips\\'s way of thinking, that audiences worldwide chose Arthur as their new Joker.The idea of switching his creation for Christopher Nolan\\'s - and let\\'s not go around the bush, the Psychopath who ends Arthur\\'s life at the end of this film is none other than Heath Ledger\\'s Joker, is both clever and dumb. First, it makes absolutely no sense when we try to understand both timelines; Phillip\\'s Joker takes place back in the 1980s while Nolan\\'s Joker is thriving in the early 2000s. Second, minimizes completely Arthur\\'s journey leaving him as the pathetic disappointment that inspired the real Clown Prince of Crime.This also means that Ledger\\'s Joker was in his mid-40s??This opens the possibility of a third chapter, that according to Phillips will never happen; at least not with him as Director, where Harley Quinn returns to Arkham as the Psychiatrist she truly is after finding out that Arthur was slain by the new Joker - who is everything she wanted Arthur to be, but couldn\\'t.If instead of musical numbers, and slowly than watching paint dry sequences, this film would\\'ve included that ending - the ending where Harley meets Nolan\\'s Joker and their \"Folie à Deux\" connects. If I had gotten that this film could\\'ve been something truly special.At least to me.Unfortunately, we got this half-cooked thing that feels like a mockery, I think unintentionally, of what should remain as a film classic; 2019 Joker.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Rating: 6.6\\nOverall, a clear cash grab as this movie does not provide anything new or interesting to the universe and ruins the unique, open-ended brilliance of 'Joker'; but it is a decent watch for its cinematography, visuals, technicals, and acting.Direction: Pretty Good\\nThe direction on a macroscale is great as he uses cinematography and imagery to really paint the screen and build the world; the direction on a microscale is not that strong as it feels like it is kind of rehashing what they did in the last film, and the interpersonal scenes between Phoenix and Gaga were not that amazing; the storytelling is a lot less innovative as last time as they really don't subvert your expectations because the movie just goes through the progressions; the use of music and musical numbers to help tell the story was not that strong as it really only hurt the movie by moving away from what was going on; they build tension well as they still use score and cinematography to help with this, but it feels like this is just using experience from the last filmStory: Bad\\nThe concept is not that great; it is not that original, and really just feels like a cash grab; the movie does not really provide anything new to these characters and just shows why there should not have been a sequel; the idea of having this be a jukebox musical really kinda backfired in the end because it did not feel like it was executed well and took away from the charm of the first movie; the plot structure is way more linear this time around and pretty predictable, with the interjections in musical numbers being the only thing that deviates from the linear structure; the character writing is not that great this time around as it does not provide any additional depth to Arthur Fleck; it honestly makes his character worse as they took away a lot from what made the character interesting in the first film, and Lee really just feels like an uninteresting interpretation of Harley Quinn; this story really hurts the first movie as the predecessor no longer has an open-for-interpretation endingScreenplay: Pretty Good\\nThe dialogue is alright for the most part, but has a lot of corny and cringey lines that really stand out and make the movie feel pretentious; the humor is not as strong this time around, but does have some noteworthy moments; there are so many illusions and homages in this movie as the movie references like 'Singing in the Rain' and 'Psycho' while also referencing important historical trials like Ted Bundy and Billy Milligan, but it does so in a little too overt manner at times; the symbolism is not as strong as the previous movie as there really isn't anything to take away from this movie; the foreshadowing is not as strong as the first movie as they really plant seeds that never come out, kinda subverting our expectations by being predictable this time aroundActing: Good\\nJoaquin Phoenix: Good to Very Good (Uses a lot of his experience from playing to role to help define this character and feels like he never left in the more dramatic scenes, but does not really hold his own well in the musical numbers; does not have the best chemistry with Lady Gaga; does not feel like he was given as much runway to work with this time around)\\nLady Gaga: Good (Does very well in the music numbers and holds her own well; is not really given that much material to really show off and stand alone outside of Phoenix's performance; does not have the best chemistry with Phoenix)\\nBrendan Gleeson: Good (Has a surprisingly charismatic performance and has good chemistry with Phoenix)\\nCatherine Keener: Pretty Good to Good (Plays her role well and has good chemistry with Phoenix)\\nZazie Beetz: Pretty Good (Really just a cameo)\\nRest of the cast: Pretty Good (Supports the main cast well and shows the different faces of Gotham)Score: Very Good\\nStill has a lot of the same themes as the first movie and is still used to create tension, it is just used way less than the first movieSoundtrack: Decent\\nThe song selection was pretty good; it is just the musical numbers were pretty hit or miss; I enjoyed the grand dance sequence numbers that felt like non-sequiturs, but felt like the singing in the middle of scenes really took away from the filmCinematography: Incredible\\nThe best part of the movie, as I felt, was the cinematography; it really painted the screen with stunning visuals and was effectively used to display imagery to make this movie feel like an art piece; Some of my favorite shots were the 'Singing in the Rain' reference, the pills making a smile, the smile with the lipstick on the glass, and the courtroom scene where Arthur is out of focus but you see his face looking at the audience from the video-camera screen; The use of IMAX shots was done well as this was mostly used to show grand sequences, inside Arthur's mind, or the musical numbers; The color grading was really nice in helping show the dark, colorless side of GothamEditing: Great\\nUsed very well in conjunction with the cinematography to make this movie visually appealing and an art pieceSound: Very Good\\nUsed well to build tension and show some of the action sequences; the constant laughing and distant sounds in the background really helped us feel like we are inside Arthur's mind as he constantly hears thoughtsVisual Effects: Good\\nHelped paint the world of Gotham; the pyrotechnics and practice effects felt fine, but not that surprisingProduction Design: Very Good\\nReally enjoyed how they created Gotham (basically New York City) and Arkham Asylum; really enjoyed some of the sets for the musical scenes as they felt like they paid homage to the 50s and 60s; the production design as a whole did not feel as amazing/iconic as the last movieMakeup: Very Good\\nHelped paint and create the Joker and Harley QuinnCostumes: Very Good\\nHelped paint and create the Joker and Harley QuinnPacing\\nPacing was good for the most part, as the movie felt like it was getting through a lot of plot in such a short runtime; the climax could have been cut a littleClimax\\nThe climax was poorly executed, as it felt like it did not end the movie well, as it felt like nothing interesting happened; the sequel was definitely more straightforward and not as iconic or innovative as the first movieTone\\nTone is not good as it tries to be a musical while simultaneously trying to be an auteur-driven psychological thriller; the former really hurts the intentions of the latter as it does neither very wellFinal Notes\\nI really felt like this movie wasn't necessary going into the movie and I feel this way even more after watching the movie; this movie just feels like a cash grab as it does not provide anything new or interesting to the universe; the idea of having a sequel really hurts the open-ended nature of the first movie and kinda makes it worse in retrospect.\",\n",

This film is a musical, which gives it a cool twist, even if it's a bit dark. Some folks might say it's less dark than the first one, and I can see why. The first part really built up the Joker's character, but this time, it focuses more on Lady Gaga's character and how she connects with him.This phase is super important for the Joker because it shows how he'll become more wild. By the end, you get a hint of how he'll really let loose in the next movie. The film talks about serious stuff like mental health and how people treat each other, and it does it well. Plus, the music and the way the city looks are really impressive.I didn't see any big problems with the movie. It's strong and makes you think. Overall, Joker: Folie à Deux is definitely a must-watch!\",\n",

Lady Gaga's Harley is suitable as his love interest, and the musical numbers are poignant and well made.The film is something we don't get very often...it's art. It almost reminds me of the old 60's Batman episode where Joker paints a blank canvass and calls it art and wins a contest - it's just...art. The movie is art.The film completely flips the superhero/supervillain genre script on its head and commits to being a Broadway musical as Fleck deals with the repercussions of his actions in the first film and the madness of the forces battling inside of him and in the world around him. Who saw that coming?The third act of his movie could have been stronger and I would have rather set up a third Joker film - but I liked the way this movie took risks and committed to them and made something the world has never seen before.\",\n",

It was just the ending to me and the closing actions which really started to bore me purely because the ending was so rushed.

       "    'Review': \"Joker Folie À Deux is a bold and ambitious sequel and I really respect just how creative this film is. Just like the first movie Todd Phillips killed it in the directors chair and the cinematography is the most beautiful I've seen all year. Joaquin Phoenix returns to play Joker and he does a great job. I also really like Joker's character arc in this film of coming to terms with who he is compared to who he wants to be. Lady Gaga brought her phenomenal acting chops to her portrayal of Harley Quinn and she did a great job with what she was given. However she wasn't really given all that much. This version of Harley Quinn was inconsistently written and underdeveloped. Her motivation makes less sense as the movie goes on and the character really is Harley Quinn in name only. She doesn't really act anything like the Harley Quinn we have grown to know and love over the years. This brings me to my problems with the script in general. This is a movie that hits you over the head with what it's trying to say. This is a film all about Arthur Fleck growing as a person and trying to be more than the Joker persona that he used to start a movement. There is definitely some interesting social commentary but all the slow burn subtlety from the first film is thrown out and exchanged for loud and obnoxious messaging that feels like a script trying to check boxes and not a natural story. This is frustratingly obvious with the ending of the movie where one of Joker's followers feels betrayed and stabs him to death. I also don't understand why Harley Quinn didn't just kill Joker instead of that random guy. It would've felt more natural and personal while still representing what that message was supposed to be. The movie's pacing also feels off. I think a lot of that has to do with the musical numbers which just feel kind of pointless and unnecessary. Since the musical numbers don't add much of anything to the story they just make the movie drag. The music isn't very memorable or interesting which doesn't help either. However the musical set pieces look great. The production design is great all around, and same goes for the makeup. The costumes are hit or miss for me personally. The costumes during the musical sequences are pretty cool but most of Joker and Harley's outfits are kind of bland, especially the more modern take on Harley's red and black outfit. Overall this is a well made movie from most aspects of film making. While I don't think it deserves the immense hatred that it's getting it definitely has problems. The movie is focused on a messy script and the clunky pacing just highlights how messy it is. The fact that the first movie is so much better also hurts this movie a bit too.\",\n",

I would agree the first film is stronger it has a overall stronger direction I would say but at the same time I still enjoyed this film more than a lot of other people seem to. Joaquin Phoenix is really great as expected he was really great in the original joker film and lady Gaga did a pretty great job as Harley Quine she still isent as great as Margot Robbie's Harley Quine but she was really good and fit the film. This film definitely Doesn't have nearly as strong of a direction as the first one it kind of just keeps going and then stops and then goes again but it's still not bad I don't think this is that bad of a sequel.

I also enjoyed that it didn't take itself too seriously and was not just a traditional sequel to Joker.But they also sprinkled in some numbers that felt jarringly weak in comparison to everything else. You can't just awkwardly film Phoenix singing poorly and justify it being in a musical. It felt like they didn't know how to actually make a musical at times. Quality over quantity should've been the idea when it came to the songs.Also the ending was a giant middle finger. I'm not saying movies have to have the expected or happy ending - it's more interesting if they don't. But it felt like they didn't give care and just wanted to be contrarian. There was no intention to do anything meaningful with the relationship with Arthur and Harley.\",\n",

The acting from both Phoenix and Lady Gaga was good.I was previously aware that the movie was more or less a musical. I'm not a fan of musicals but I thought that using that to give the audience a sense of Arthur Fleck's confused state of mind fit. And it did work - to a point. However it was overdone to the point where it overshadowed the overall story. It reached the point where the continued musical numbers became tedious and boring. By the time the film reached it's conclusion I was no longer riveted like I had been earlier. I was pretty much bored and waiting for it to be done with.Story-wise, I felt that everything about it made sense. I just got the sense that the story wasn't told well.

       "    'Review': \"The Joker sequel has to be one of the least wanted sequels in a long time - and boy, is it unnescessary!When I first heard about them making a sequel and making it a musical I was sceptical but still curious with caution to see what they would make of it. The general idea of the jokers mind being portrayed through musical numbers was promising - and very much in character in my opinion. However, the execution of this film was far from great.Firstly, I want to applaud the performance once again from Joacquin Phoenix who still plays the roll of Arthur Fleck to perfection, he has not phoned it in for this sequel. Lady Gaga made a good contribution too - when she actually gets to act. She has unfortunately not been giving much to act on and the focus is more on the musical aspects, since Lady Gaga is a musician after all. She is a great actress and it's a shame they didn't let her act more.The cinematography, lighting and assets, choregraphy and music is great in this film.Where Joker: Folie a Deux really stumbles is in the story department. It really adds NOTHING new to the first film, it's basically the same film as the first one retold. Todd Philips does NOT know how to make good sequels, it seems. An example I can think of is The Hangover films, who did not need sequels, and once they came out, they basically were the same films. No character progression, no additional story features that we did not already know about, it has NO substance what so ever. It's a shame because the musical aspect is really interesting to me. Unfortunately, the story falls flat, does not add anything and the musical numbers also felt quite abrupt at times, like they were just thrown in there for the sake of a musical, which ruined the pacing as well.This film is not as bad as people depict it to be, however. It's an all right enough film that unfortunately gets bogged down by the awful writing, pacing, and general direction. The ending of this film (no spoiler here) is also a very strange, and to be honest, badly written one. It felt like fan-fiction.It is completely unnescessary and should not really exist. If you've seen the first one, then you can expect that the second film is just the first one being retold through a courtroom drama / musical numbers. You won't get much out of it. I enjoyed it for what it was, even if it wasn't what I expected, and I don't think this movie is deserving of the low rating it has. It deserves at least a 6, which i base my rating on. I would give it a 6,5 but I can't rate it like that here.Short summary:Story - 2/10\\nMusic - 8/10\\nActing - 10/10\\nCinematography - 8/10.\",\n",

Lady Gaga was okay in the film. The tone and the atmosphere in the film was the same as the first.Making the moving musical made sense to me because of how Arthur Fleck interacted with music and how he imagine stuff in the first movie, in the stairs scene or the show scene. Also there is some perspective in the society side is that Joker now is the entertainer and the hero to them so that's why Arthur was imagining himself as an entertainer. The music choice was great and it wasn't too much or little it was perfect.Todd Phillips should've wrote the Harley's story more we didn't see why she want to be with the joker. The writing didn't gave Gaga an opportunity or justice to deliver a good performance during the film. The idea of she doesn't want to be with the Joker because Arthur doesn't want to be the Joker anymore is brilliant but the delivery was so bad and rushed. That shows that Harley loves the joker not Arthur.The trial scene was great and one of the best in modern cinema and again Joaquin did an outstanding performance.Another thing in the movie is that they don't show us more of the Arthur they only show us little bet of what his mom thinks of him but I felt I wanted more. The movie felt like it doesn't have that core but there is some messages and meanings but it lacked the core.The ending was one of the worst ending ever I have ever seen because the ending was missing a conclusion I mean poor Arthur what he has done to deserve bad writing from Todd like that. At the end watching that ending made me saying that we didn't need a sequel in the first place I give the movie between 6 to 7.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I knew from the moment I saw the trailer and heard it was a musical that Joker: Folie à Deux wouldn't match the first film. The movie is very slow paced at times and the story is kind of messy and all over the place. Also, like the majority of people, I think the musical aspect of the film was very unnecessary. I don't hate the idea of putting 1 song (2 max) in the film because I do believe that's something Joker would think of in his mind while he's not in touch with reality but it felt like there was a musical number every 5 minutes and it gets old fast. I believe there was 15 songs in the film. Warner Bros. Was scared to market this as a musical so I'm not sure why they took that route to begin with. However, there are great things about this film like the cinematography and the wonderful acting by Joaquin Phoenix, just as we saw in the first movie. Lady Gaga was very good in this as well but I thought her character was underutilized, so much more could've been done there. If you loved the first Joker, you still might like this film. I'm kind of in the middle, I don't dislike it but it's nowhere near the first. It's not one I'd rush out to see right away.\",\n",

The musical sequences fit well, and while they're not as excessive as people claim, they add depth to the story.

As with the first film this sequel is dealing with some serious mental health issues. After I saw the first one I remember thinking, \"I don\\'t want to see Batman punch this guy, I want to hug him\". It\\'s the same here. It\\'s hard to look at Author as a villain.

       "    'Review': 'Let\\'s begin by saying that this film is nowhere near as bad as many as insisting. The original Joker is a stand-alone masterpiece that didn\\'t need a follow-up but was forced to have one due to it\\'s colossal financial success. That accepted, Todd Phillips appears to have been of the attitude that, \"You want a sequel? I\\'ll give you a sequel!\" approaching this second flick with the same anarchic irreverence that Arthur Fleck himself might approve of.What we end up with is a bizarre love-story musical / courtroom drama hybrid, interspersed with show-tunes and dance sequences imagined by Joker as he enters the throes of love, having finally found a soul-mate (or so he thinks). The problem is that few of the musical numbers propel the story forwards or even add to it, not least of all because there\\'s very little story to shift. There\\'s an amusing rendition of \"If My Friends Could See Me Now\" and a genuinely poignant and fragile version of Jacques Brel\\'s \"If You Go Away\", but Lady Gaga is pretty much under-used, and Phoenix is certainly no singer.In terms of drama, the film merely treads water, though the scenes outside the courtroom and prison smack beautifully of the same dark, dank imagery used so superbly in the first film. What this means is that we have some excellent atmosphere but no real substance, at least for most of the 140 minutes on offer. For much of the time, the audience is left intrigued by certain ideas - about where the film might be going - but so much is left unrealised, that a sense of disappointment is probably unavoidable.However, the real reason why Joker: Folie a Deux might leave lovers of the first film so disillusioned is that the former undoes much of what Joker presented. If Joker was the tale of a desperately unhappy, abused and lonely man finally finding his voice and identity through his own insanity, this sequel drags Arthur back to reality - to the point where he has to face who and what he actually is. In that respect, Phillips, Phoenix et al deserve huge credit for an audacious attempt to give the public what the do NOT want - to make even the biggest fans of the first movie realise that they weren\\'t watching what they thought they were watching all along. That alone is an incredible attempt at something different and deserves credit.Does the film succeed? Not really. There again, to quote Malcolm McLaren, \"Better to be a spectacular failure than any kind of benign success.\"',\n",

       "    'Review': 'After watching this film most like me will say that director Todd Phillips took a different approach from his 2019 original. Picking up where we left off Arthur Fleck(in another good turn from Joaquin Phoenix) is in prison at Arkham awaiting trial. However aside from seeing his identity issues between his self and \"The Joker\" themes are introduced of love and music. In a wild card like way is character Lee(the talented Lady Gaga) who\\'s given Arthur the hope and fantasy of love while introducing him to music which is like an escape for Fleck. While all of these themes play out the film has plenty of flashbacks and foreshadowing as Arthur sees it all in the form of his \"Joker\" past and present. Overall any \"D.

Joaquin Phoenix rightfully earned his Oscar for the role.So now we have a sequel. \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" works best when addressing the criminal (in)justice system. The musical scenes, meanwhile, look out of place for this kind of movie. There are plenty of movies where it works perfectly for the characters to break out into song - even movies dealing with an unpleasant topic - but it doesn\\'t add anything here, even with Lady Gaga giving it her all as Harley Quinn.In conclusion, it\\'s not a terrible movie, but still no comparison to the original.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"I just got out of Joker: Folie à DeuxThis isn't a disappointment. It's a bad movie, full stop.Todd Phillips has massively dropped the ball. Everything that was great about the first movie, is missing here. The first movie was meant to be a stand alone movie. But when it made as much as it did. Money talked and it may have talked about making a deadline for the release date, as this is a mess.I don't read or watch reviews before I watch a new movie. But I seen a headline that said Joker Folie à Deux feels like it was bad on purpose. And I get what they mean as it seems Phillips is angry at the fans for making the first movie so successful. He has deliberately gone out of his way to make a movie, they will not even like, let alone love.As what we get is a boringly paced, badly edited, totally unfocused movie, that never gets going, lacks any clear direction (it's all over the place) with a script that needed at least another rewrite.I love a good musical. But the musical sequences in this, stop the movie in it's tracks. They do not belong in this movie. Take them out and you have a better movie. I'd say it's 50/50 songs and dialogue.I think a lot of people, especially people who loved the first movie, are going to hate this. As Phillips totally tears the character of Joker down in a lot of ways.I will say it looks gorgeous with some sticking images and it does have some moments of genius and real standout moments. I think everyone will agree on what the stand out moment of the movie is.Joaquin Phoenix again nails it. Lady GaGa was great too, very charismatic, in a very poorly written role (she doesn't even really become Harley Quinn. She is very unlikeable and downright cruel.I think she has been the victim of some last minute editing, as the ad campaign make this seem like she is co-lead. That is not the case at all. It's a supporting role. A lot of her stuff has been cut from the finished movie. The title doesn't even make sense Folie à Deux translates to a shared delusion. That is not this movie. Arthur and Lee share very little.Brendan Gleason is great too, but when isn't he??They should have turned down the money and kept it at one movie.\",\n",

His lawyer, \"Maryanne Stewart,\" played by Catherine Keener, is trying to get a responsible defense against the prosecutor, \"Harvey Dent,\" played by Harry Lawtey.The guards in \"Arkham\" can be hit or miss, but correctional officer \"Jackie Sullivan,\" played by Brendan Gleeson, gets \"Arthur\" in a class where he meets fellow patient \"Lee Quinzel,\" played by Lady Gaga.You watch as the trial of the century takes place in \"Gotham.\" Along with how \"Arthur\" wrestles with a mix of emotions and his fandom. All while falling in love with \"Lee.\" In this musically inspired sequel.\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" was a tease. It had the template for something magical. I mean, you saw the first film. But this one dropped the ball overall.I\\'m not a huge steak eater. But I hear the true steak lovers say if you have a good steak, you don\\'t need A1 sauce on it. The first film was a tomahawk; they just needed to cook it the same, maybe add some different sides. Instead, they added a crap ton of A1 sauce and drowned out the whole steak. You could taste how good the steak was in spots, but your taste buds would get thrown off by the mouthful of A1 sauce you were consuming.I get it. Todd Phillips isn\\'t following the comics per se. He made the first film about mental health. It was a unique and real take on a villain we all know. In this film, with Lady Gaga, I was so excited because she can act with the best of them. We saw how the first film ended, so I expected or at least wanted them to terrorize the city together.Todd Phillips went in the exact opposite direction. I did not like his creative vision for this film. At all. When I heard it was a musical, I was confused. This just seemed like adding something unnecessary to an excellent film already.Every time I got into what was going on, then a random musical number would appear. It got annoying. Some of the music went along with the flow, but others derailed the pace and feel of the scene. The acting was so good I wanted to see more, especially at pivotal moments. Just for me to constantly get something that didn\\'t fit. It\\'s a lot of music. Joaquin Phoenix can hold a note. But I just didn\\'t think this film called for it.If the first film is about becoming \"Joker,\" then this film is about returning to \"Arthur Fleck.\" They had some really good ingredients in this film. You could tell they paid a pretty penny to film it. I didn\\'t like the vision for \"Harley Quinn.\" I mean \"Lee.\" I liked them adding \"Harvey Dent.\" He was a tool, by the way.I\\'m not a huge musical fan. I still could appreciate some of the musical numbers. But you\\'re alienating a huge chunk of your original fan base to make this move.Overall, the acting is phenomenal; you just wish they focused more on that than the music. Joaquin said it was hard to film because losing weight was fine, but now adding all this dancing and singing makes it extremely hard to film.Lady Gaga said she had to switch her singing voice up and sing with a completely different tone. You could tell, but her iconic sound still came out a couple of times.It\\'s not all bad, but it\\'s far from great too. Mental health is a huge component of this film. It was still extremely deep. The music isn\\'t bad; it just felt unnecessary. If you enjoy musicals, you will probably like this film.By the very end, I expected any scene I loved to get ruined by a musical routine. I was over it and kind of down on how it ended. Todd Phillips had a masterpiece. If they were going to go so drastic then they should\\'ve done it the first film or just not do a second film. A decision I know they wish they could redo. Someone should have said, \"Hey, you know you don\\'t have to add all this extra stuff, your meal is already delicious\".

It Is genuinely a very well made movie, the visuals are gorgeous, the score and editing I found to be fantastic, I did like the dark tone this movie had, similar to the first. There are also scenes in this that I thought were good. The performances were especially fantastic, even with the weak script that the actors had to work with, the performances, manly Joaquin Phoenix's performance felt oscar worthy. I wouldn't put this movie near the worst comic movie ever made because the movie at least felt unique.I do have a lot more to say about this film but overall, Joker: Folie a Deux belongs on the long list of disappointing sequels.Overall Score: 65/100.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'To be honest, I only watched Joker 1 because of the reviews people were given for Joker 2, and I wanted to see why people were upset.Author Fleck in the first movie was a mentally ill man who even though he kills six people he exposes the hard life people in Gotham City deal with and how they largely have no chance of living good lives. It\\'s understandable, personally the Joker character is not my type, but it was a good watch.Author is now in prison and is on trial for his murders - did he commit his crimes due to insanity (multiple personality disorder) or did he act with a sound mind and should be executed. Okay simple enough story and personally would have enjoyed a story where they sat in the court for the whole 2 hours discussing the matter similar to how the 12 Angry Men (1957) was directed however they went another way.Before Author attends court, he meets Lee Quinzel, who claimed she had been abused and was put in a mental prison by her crazy mother, they bond over this and make plans that once Author is out, they will live a good life not worrying about the craziness around them. Again, I would have been fine with this even though I could not care less about a love interest, and I seriously don\\'t understand how she truly fits into the story. Lee Quinzel is comparable to tumble girl crazy - had a good upbringing, has a good life but wants something exciting and thus wants to be around actual hard-on-their-luck people to feel like them and be them. Which is why I don\\'t like her; her insertion does not completely flow unless we are looking at an angle of the rich wanting to cosplay the poor or exploit them.Which brings in another part the singing, why was there singing I don\\'t know. Yes, Author liked music however it wasn\\'t necessarily a big part of Joker 1, mainly it was the song \"that life...\" which was used as an emphasis on his horrible life (and for him to dance around - which made him look free in Joker 1) but in this movie, singing is seemingly an integral part like it a musical however it misses a point in that during a musical number we move from scene to scene the songs flow into the next scene - they essentially take out the dialogue and replace it with singing and it transitions (whilst explaining) to a different scene. But here they talked about something and then sang the about same thing and stayed in the same scene PLUS they often sang the \"same songs\" (songs that had the same idea all the time - so it became annoying and repetitive). So yeah, singing was completely unnecessary and did not match the tone of the movie.And then the ending - okay interesting but I kind of did not care after watching 2 hours of everything else.Overall, I did not like the movie. The acting was good, everybody did their job. The singing from Lady Gaga was good (of course) but I did not care for the Author\\'s singing. I do not know what I was expecting but possibly Author working on his comedic material and acquiring a better community inside prison. Or maybe replace Lee Quinzel with Ricky where Ricky does not look up to Joker and rehabilitate together or something because he kept showing up but nothing much to his character.I do like the fact he was made into a \"normal person\" as I do feel like some people overly interpreted Author in the first movie as their hero who stood up against \"the big dogs\" where in reality even though he did do that; he did it because he was being provoked or abused, the man is the definition of what happens when social services don\\'t do their job or funding is cut. He was not a Giga Chad.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"No Spoilers...\\n5 years ago JOKER was released and it became an phenomenal sensation throughout the world for it's unique take on character showing harsh reality of this world in a bleak and violent story about an mentally ill character, it was a masterpiece but after that film earned 1B WB forced a sequel that shouldn't have made in the first place..\\nThis film continues the story from 1st film but didn't deliver what it promised rather it becomes a meta movie which mocks the character and audience instead of progressing the story in a meaningful way.. Joaquin pheonix still manage to deliver a steller performance and Lady Gaga was also good but film fails from a storytelling point where nothing really happens which makes audience feel the same way they felt in 2019,Harley Quinn is barely present and appears only here and there only to manipulate Arthur which let nowhere at the end..Arthur is now imprisoned in Arkham Asylum and waiting for his trial where he meets Harley Quinn but after that it becomes just some fantasy filled musical sequences and courtroom drama with an lackluster climax which destroys the legacy of the original film and the character shown in that,maybe a film about Joker and Harley escaping and doing crazy acts would've been received better .. Now I don't have any problems with musical numbers and court room drama scenes were also we'll acted but joker was more of a plot device than an actual being here.. This film should have been about Joker and Harley doing ultimate madness which delivers on its Foile à Deux name which means madness for two.. Twist ending was good but it feels forced instead of earned there were also some deeply disturbing scenes like the first one and dark beautiful cinematography and haunting score is what keeps this film together.. It also makes a point that people will only love you when you act like their own will but if you don't they'll abandon you, and that's what it happening in this movies in real world also audience wanted a Joker who goes on killing spree and doing ultimate madness associated with character instead they got another character study of an mentally ill man that's why the hate.. But Todd Phillips should've known people have already seen this aspect of story 5 years ago and rehasing the same old character study theme won't settle well with audience because they want something new not some old boring crap which didn't even matched the half level of the previous film.. Overall Joker 2 is a good film which completely falls flat due to uninspiring story and over the top deconstruction of the character no one wanted at the first place it was a step backwards instead of going forward after setting up a good ending in the last one..\\nWB should have focused on the real sequels that fans want like MoS 2, JL 2, WW 3 etc instead they wasted 200m dollars at something which shouldn't have existed in the first place...Typical bad WB move.

       "    'Review': \"The image, photography, lighting, sound, colors, scenery, shots, symbols, focuses and blurs, interpretations, costumes, makeup and production are MAGNIFICENT. Explosive scenes both in their metaphor and literality, an amazing control of shading, lighting and color, which together with the photography, encourage and solidify my beliefs as to why this footage is an audiovisual marvel. Apart from this, the original plot feels almost empty, the only character I managed to empathize with was the dwarf who had lost his job (which is cool because he's a great character but in the first movie I was able to empathize in a certain moment with The Joker and his mother).The script is so basic that it is not even decent, lacking all that brilliance with which they showed off in the originality of the shots and symbols of abundant moral meaning. The film also fails to have a clear main reflection, no matter how good or entertaining the moments of the songs are, which are vaguely calming and in my opinion they put too much. Furthermore, the ending did not leave me wanting more, or even satisfied. At all. I was expecting a Joker madly in love with Harley, and of course they put him in, because he was already crazy before. The bad thing is that when he falls in love, the character loses all kinds of mischief, insight, and especially his instinct, one of the qualities that made this character such a charismatic icon.I liked it, undeniably; there were parts that I didn't enjoy as much as I would have liked, and they almost seemed tiresome, but the film kept its pace relatively well and it is worth seeing, especially for the tremendous performance of the aforementioned Joaquin Phoenix. He demonstrated, without a doubt, all the professionalism he possesses and how versatile he is.Conclusion & overall: underrated recommended movie. It's worth seeing and enjoying it without taking into account the first footage, because instead of giving you the somber vision that you expected from a story like this, so real and so painfully human, they decorate it with songs that, at least in my opinion, are half left over, if not almost all of them.For more reviews like this one, don't forget to follow. Thanks.Sincerely,\\nbiggest 446.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Todd Phillips\\' \\'Joker: Folie à Deux\\' boldly transforms the gritty realism of the first film into a musical. Set in Arkham Asylum, it delves deeper into Arthur Fleck\\'s psyche, now fully embraced by Joaquin Phoenix\\'s chillingly transformative performance as the Joker and Lady Gaga\\'s debut as Harley Quinn.The film\\'s ambition elevates it but unfortunately leads to its downfall. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s captivating and unsettling performance, coupled with Lady Gaga\\'s vocal prowess, creates a captivating chemistry, especially in the musical numbers. The choice of classic tunes and modern renditions offers a nostalgic yet eerie soundtrack.However, the decision to make this a musical feels misjudged. The integration of songs disrupts the dark, brooding atmosphere of the first film, serving as distractions rather than deepening the narrative. This shift in tone dilutes the original\\'s stark brutality, attempting to broaden its appeal but losing its impact.The story and direction are well-crafted, but the musical elements detract from the overall impact of the film.\"Phillips\\' visually engaging homage to classic musicals struggles with a cohesive narrative. The film\\'s excessive time in Arkham Asylum, while thematic, feels claustrophobic and repetitive. The plot, focusing on Arthur\\'s trial and his budding romance with Harley, lacks the societal critique and rise-to-infamy arc of its predecessor. Instead, it centers on personal madness and love, which is intriguing but doesn\\'t fully satisfy expectations.Criticism centers around Harley Quinn\\'s underdevelopment. Lady Gaga\\'s performance is magnetic, but the script lacks depth and backstory to fully showcase her beyond her musical talents. The film\\'s reluctance to fully embrace either its musical or dramatic elements leaves it in a thematic limbo. The potential for exploring the duo\\'s dynamic is partially realized.\\'Joker: Folie à Deux\\' is a film of contrasts: brilliant in its performances and musical moments, yet disjointed in its narrative and tonal consistency. It\\'s a daring experiment that, while commendable, doesn\\'t fully land. For fans of Phoenix and Gaga, or those intrigued by the unusual marriage of comic book adaptation with musical genre, there\\'s enough to appreciate. However, for those who found the original\\'s dark realism compelling, this sequel might feel like a step into a different, less satisfying universe. A 6 out of 10 reflects this film\\'s ambitious yet flawed attempt at combining the criminal with the carnivalesque.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Todd Phillips, I see you! The intention behind this sequel is so clear, and I believe that it was an organic continuation of the first movie. In my opinion, Arthur was never meant to be idolized, neither from the people in the movie, nor from the general public in the real world. It was not to generate a villain-hero, it was a commentary on social causes, on how society failed Arthur.This sequel remarks the idea that we all got the first movie wrong. It screams: it is not what you think it is, this is not what we should be talking about (semi-cit).Does this sequel add something to the story? No.Does something really happen in the movie? No.Was this movie necessary? Yes.Acting-wise, Joaquin Phoenix is superb! Lady Gaga, despite relatively limited screen time, since scene one is utterly credible in the role of an unhinged and dangerous narcissist.The only problem is: where is the folie à deux? This is probably my biggest critique to the movie. The idea behind the interaction of two main characters is very interesting, but I was left with the sense that it could have been explored more in depth.I wasn't sure about the musical aspect of the whole movie, but overall it makes sense and I believe it works well in setting the scene of complete delusions that the character are in. A few musical numbers felt a bit off tho, either in the placement along the movie, or because completely disconnected from the narrative. Whereas Phoenix's performance of 'The Joker' really is pure art.Overall, an Ok movie, with its highs and lows. Far (but not too far) from the first Joker. But ultimately directed to set the record straight.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker: Folie à Deux just had its premiere, and I have never seen so many people at an opening night. The line stretched all the way outside. Expectations were sky-high, to say the least! But how did people leave the theater? Many walked out feeling confused, and that\\'s understandable. The movie does something no one has ever seen before, and people certainly weren\\'t ready for it.At first, I was ready to harshly criticize it. But the more I thought about it, the more conflicted I became. There are two ways to interpret this movie/musical. One interpretation is that it failed. Failed to entertain the audience, failed to deliver what people wanted-especially for those expecting something similar to the first film. That\\'s because Joker: Folie à Deux chooses the musical format to convey its message. Now, that\\'s not inherently a bad thing. We\\'ve seen musicals that have done the exact opposite, like La La Land or Chicago. But here, even though the musical element is a core part of the movie, with Lady Gaga\\'s inclusion promising a spectacular show, it falls short of delivering on that promise.Gaga sings flawlessly, but it\\'s not the Gaga we know. It\\'s as if her larger-than-life persona has vanished. Meanwhile, most of the songs feel flat, not taking you anywhere, making you experience them as pauses in the story rather than moments of progression. Unfortunately, the story itself feels repetitive at times and doesn\\'t quite hook you in. Additionally, the chemistry between Joker and Harley Quinn is not what you\\'d expect-it\\'s weak. If the film had 3-4 fewer musical numbers (since some were genuinely worth keeping), we might be having a very different conversation. There are individual moments in the film that are brilliant, but they fail to connect with the rest, losing their impact within a broader, somewhat unpleasant whole.At one point, Joker says to Harley, \"Stop singing,\" and I think the entire theater collectively agreed with him. But that\\'s where the second interpretation of this movie comes in. With that line, it\\'s as if Todd Phillips is winking at the audience, telling us, \"I know you\\'re not having fun. I feel you. I\\'m not clueless; I know what I\\'m doing.\" And what he\\'s doing is as bold as it is necessary. He\\'s creating a new reference point in art. He sacrifices the mainstream success of his film to make a statement and leave behind something that we might never see again.Think about it-when will you ever see one of DC\\'s darkest villains, the Joker, in a musical again, and not in some indie production but in a blockbuster? In short, Joker: Folie à Deux may fail as a blockbuster, as a film for everyone, as basic entertainment, but it succeeds in shaking up pop culture. It might very well go down in history as a bold, audacious piece of art that inspires future creators to break the norms.Now that this movie exists, others can attempt to blend the most unlikely genres, hoping to create something extraordinary, a new hybrid. Joker: Folie à Deux certainly wasn\\'t that, though. But the start has to come from somewhere. So, I rate it a 6/10 as a viewer because it could have been much better, even in the format it chose, but as an art lover, I tip my hat to it for what it may inspire in the future.As for the ending, which many didn\\'t like at all, for me, it was the entire movie :)',\n",

This guy is just not capable of writing a really good, well-balanced and complicated script. Musical scenes, even though they're beatifully sang, feel very much out of nowhere and unnecessary. The whole court trial is a bad joke. And there are also a few plot wholes, of course.Phoenix is great again, maybe even better than before, but his role is much less flashy, so people will appreciate it less. Gaga is also doing a great job, but she has much less to do, that she should. The whole movie obviously looks really good and the technical side does the job.In the end, it's much more original and treats mental problems more seriously, but it's still a bit worse than the first movie.

       "    'Review': 'Believe me I would have loved to praise Joker Folie Á Deux as a cinematic masterpiece - like the first Joker film. I really would have. But unfortunately it is not.The main problem is the storyline. Despite of +2 hours runtime the plot can be retold in four short sentences. There really is not much to it. Sadly, because there was so much potential for shaping Arthur Fleck into the supervillain from the Batman franchise and complete the best origin story ever made.When you look at Joker: Folie Á Deux as an independent movie - and we have to, right? - there is barely no development in the plot. Almost no progression. It feels more like a brief postscript to the first film, than like a story in its own right. Like it is living on all the qualities we remember from Joker and not really taking us any further - not telling a new story.It could have been so great. Building on the storyline from the first film with its public riots. Where the rage and the anger was rising from the filthy city gutters. The poor, the working class and the mentally ill to start a rebellion against the rich and the powerful in Gotham City. Led by The Joker ultimately entering organized crime. A layered and complex story like a major jigsaw puzzle slowly assembled to fit in perfectly with the Batman universe. This element is totally missing in Folie Á Deux.All right then. Acting is still spectacular. Singing is great too. Arthur Fleck is the perfect protagonist. Brilliantly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix making the rise of the most unbelievable yet legendary cartoon supervillain a very human, emotional and social realistic story. All love and respect for the immensely talented Joaquin Phoenix acting with so much emotion and charisma - maybe the greatest actor alive.However, he cannot save this film which somehow seems fitted to Lady Gaga to quite a large extent. It\\'s a musical, and basically half the runtime takes place in the imagination of Arthur Fleck reflecting his profound love for the theatrical performance - and maybe continuing his tendency to engage in imaginary relationships? However, the singing scenes really don\\'t drive the story forward. They convey emotions. But they are sort of irrelevant with regard to the plot progression.One more problem: In the singing scenes Lady Gaga sometimes make it seems like, Joker is redundant and the only thing Joaquin Phoenix can do is raising eyebrows and averting his eyes. She steals the picture - for no reason other than \"we want some songs in the movie\".I hate saying this: But honestly, it gets boring on the way. I could not help but sigh with irritation when they began singing for the seventh time. The social realistic story of Arthur Fleck continues in the musical Folie Á Deux. But the sophisticated and intelligent origin story to the Batman universe got lost on the way.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Originally having no interest in the film, but getting curious due to the overwhelmingly negative reviews, I decided to watch Folie à Deux today to see what went so wrong. But ultimately, I don't think it's nearly as bad as people are making it out to be and I honestly thoroughly enjoyed it. However, it most definitely has multiple flawsNow, this movie is ultimately a courthouse drama, with basically only 2 locations during it's entire runtime. However, I personally found the story interesting and engaging enough to keep watching and not get bored. There are a few very questionable moments in the script though.The movie itself looks gorgeous. The cinematography and the directing was amazing and there isn't a single even remotely bad looking shot in this film. The acting from Phoenix is as outstanding as expected and Gaga also did quite well in my opinion.But where the movie fails, is that it's more of an epilogue than a sequel. There's not much new it puts on the table. Even Harley Queen seemed like an unnecessary addition that ultimately didn't matter. The whole movie is basically just talking about the events of the last one. There are some moments where it tries to show the consequences of the last film's actions (and I did like what they did do with that), but this aspect also seemed to be overshadowed by just recapping things that we already did see happen previously.The musical aspect of the movie is definitely something people are torn about, but I find myself in the middle of the pack. Sometimes the singing worked quite well in the context and the movie did have some fantasticly directed musical segments. But other times, this aspect felt too forced and just took you out of the mood. I also think they could've been built into the movie better. Instead of them being just day dreaming sequences, they should've tied them into regular scenes, like a normal musical would.People really seem to hate the ending, and I honestly don't get why. I thought it was (for the most part) a quite powerful, fitting and tragic end to the character. But it wasn't anything revolutionary or anything that would keep me thinking for more than an hour after the movie.In conclusion, there is a lot of flaws with this film and it could've been so much better. But I do feel like it's very overhated and I found myself engaged and interested in what was happening in the film. Despite the cons, I still liked the movie, but it is quite forgetable.\",\n",

People have complained about the music not fitting the scene, which is not true. Complaints of it just rehashing the first movie are fair criticisms. The complaints about no story or plot, are not fair complaints. The focus of the movie is the toxic love between Joker and Harley, and this movie plays with the standard weight of Joker being the more toxic aspect of their relationship. I think people don't understand that, most people don't understand that Harley and Joker are not a healthy couple. There is also going to be people who are sour on the ending, and the implications that are possibly made, which I won't spoil, but they are also fair complaints.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"After reading several bad reviews about this movie, I was a bit scared that I would be very disappointed. Luckily, I entered the cinema with an open mind and tried not to be affected by what most people were saying.The truth is, I was a huge fan of the first Joker movie and Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Joker was, and is, brilliant. Even on this second movie. That didn't disappoint. What I think is not everyone's cup of tea is the fact that there's a lot of singing going on and at times, I felt like it was dragged and forced only because we had Gaga in it. She's a great singer and a good actress but in my opinion, I suppose that all the singing is there because she's in it. It wouldn't be bad, if there weren't so many scenes with songs that cut the serious and darker moments of the movie short. ( And yes, I do like musicals!). However, I believe that, like me, most people enjoyed precisely that darker aspect and armosphere of the first movie in the first place.Also, although I understand that there needed to be an end to close the Todd Philips' Joker chapter, I didn't quite like this particular ending.All in all, I think it's a creative and brave attempt of the director but It was also a shot in the dark. It's one of those movies that you either hate or you are confused about whether you really liked it or not. Joaquin's astonishing performance will hopefully help you see that, in the end, it was a good movie. Not brilliant like the first one, but still a good one.\",\n",

Directed by Todd Phillips, the film ambitiously incorporates musical elements, adding a unique layer that may feel disjointed at times but showcases Gaga\\'s musical talent. Phoenix\\'s portrayal remains a masterclass, while Gaga\\'s transformation into Harley Quinn is gradual and captivating. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher and Hildur Guðnadóttir\\'s haunting score enhance the psychological tension, making this film a daring and artistically ambitious follow-up deserving of higher acclaim, even if the musical flourishes might not resonate with all viewers.',\n",

It was gut wrenching, sad and the acting is impeccable. Just amazing. Especially Lady Gaga. How can someone be so talented? It didn't seem as if they just casted her because she's famous. She genuinely is a good actress. I also liked that Lee was her own character. She loves the Joker but she isn't just that (a fact that I sometimes miss in other Harley Quinn interpretations).Brendan Gleeson is amazing as well and Joaquin Phoenix did a great job again.This film was a bit weaker than the first one but highly enjoyable to watch.Closer to reality as well as the other films surrounding the Joker story.If I knew before that this was some sort of musical I probably would have been put off by that too. But it makes sense and feeds the story. It's also fun and weird, just like Harley Quinn and the Joker.So: interesting and thrilling new take on a story that have been told a few times.

Phillips' bold choices don't all pay off, but they beat the fan-serving rehash that could have been. This quasi-musical courtroom drama is as deliberately obtuse and anti-crowd-pleasing as it possibly can be. Turning the whole Joker and Harley dynamic on its head and inversing their usual roles, Harley manipulates Arthur into the man she wants instead. It's a bizarre stroke of genius that works wonders when coupled with Pheonix and Gaga's performances. Uncertainty is the best element of the film, which sees the performances kicking off at angles when you least expect them to. The two take centre stage and deliver shining interpretations of these timeless characters, Gaga especially, such an inspired choice for Harley. Fantastic production design working in conjunction with the photography gives Director Todd Phillips a major helping hand, the musical moments do tend to come out of nowhere and stick out but I ultimately ended up liking the majority of them, the Hildur Guðnadóttir really did a number on this score. Laudable as the intentions of Folie à Deux may be, it feels thoughtfully but tiresomely stuck in the past. Still better than The People's Joker though...\",\n",

Now after the movie I'm still thinking about it and developing my own theories. The acting was excellent, even if the dialogue wasn't top tier, they made it work. Definitely recommend, but don't go in expecting something it's not. It's a movie that will make you think, not just have gratuitous violence for the sake of gratuitous violence.

       "    'Review': 'What starts out as a compelling and suspenseful psychological thriller loses itself in an unexpected transformation into a musical drama. The transition feels abrupt and misplaced, leaving the audience wondering what the film really wants to be.Yet the performances are phenomenal. Joaquin Phoenix once again brilliantly takes on the role of Arthur Fleck, a man who doesn\\'t so much embrace crime anymore in the chaos of his own psychological confusion. Lady Gaga, with her raw emotion and powerful presence, is a worthy addition, and together they lift the story to impressive heights. But even their phenomenal performances can\\'t completely save the changing pace and abrupt genre switch.Perhaps the disappointment for many viewers lies in what Arthur Fleck turns out to be. He is not the genius criminal mastermind we have come to expect from traditional antiheroes. Instead, he is portrayed as a man who is scarred to the core by trauma. Arthur is sick, deeply wounded, and his extraordinary ailments seem like nothing more than a failed attempt to cover up his unbearable pain. There is no plan, no strategy - just chaos and self-destruction.The film leaves you with a sense of oppressive unease, but perhaps that is precisely the point. \"Joker 2\" forces you to witness the pain of a man who is not a master of his fate, but a victim of his own mind. What the film seems to lack, however, is the balance between that inner despair and the societal responses to it, as its predecessor did so powerfully.\"Joker 2\" is a bold attempt, a film that is brilliant in moments but ultimately loses itself in its own experiments.',\n",

Striving for excitement and leaching off of one's pain, and their dive into murderous insanity and fascination they have for him, so much so that it propels Arthur fleck into embracing the joker persona...Harlee Quinn is one of those people.She's fascinated by the joker's chaotic murderous acts but wouldn't even bat an eye at the real Arthur fleck before the joker persona took over.The movie really shows how uncompassionate and inhumane society can really be.How humans can prop people up as some kind of superficial idol. And how quick we are to turn on them when they don't remain the plaything you wanted. It also depicts how detrimental mental illness can be.The music can be a little much at times, but it wasn't nearly as bad as people are saying. I saw a lot of reviews saying the music had nothing to do with the plot. It was very much a part of the plot if you pay attention. And in all honestly i wouldn't classify this movie as a musical its more of a thought-provoking drama with some singing here and there.All in all, i think it was a good movie that has you thinking at the end. And the ending of the movie in my opinion has fight club written all over it if you have seen it i hope you understand what im saying.Was it perfect?

The first film had a powerful narrative and character dynamics that deeply affected the audience, but this sequel doesn't create the same impact. It feels as if the director and the team made this film just to get it done, without any passion or creative energy. Given the success of the first film, audiences would have expected more from this sequel. Unfortunately, everything I watched felt lacking and disappointing.One of the biggest problems is the incredibly slow pace of the film. Of course, some films are deliberately slow to carefully build the story, but that approach doesn't work here. It takes far too long for the action to kick in, and in the meantime, the movie loses the audience. No matter how deep or interesting the story might be, if it drags on this slowly, viewers can easily lose patience. The first film had a rhythm that captured the audience's attention from start to finish, but this sequel struggles to maintain that rhythm. It feels as if the story and character development are unnecessarily prolonged. This doesn't make the film more engaging; instead, it turns it into a tedious experience.If I weren't a fan of musicals and dance, I would have struggled to give this movie even a 50 out of 100. There are some nice musical elements in the film, and the dance scenes make it somewhat watchable. However, these elements are not enough to save the overall tone of the movie. Unfortunately, even these scenes aren't placed in a way that matches the pacing and rhythm of the story. A musical or dance scene should energize the audience, but in this film, even those scenes lose their effect.The film's pace is incredibly slow, to the point where it's slower than what you would expect from a sequel. Usually, sequels pick up where the first film left off and speed up the action or plot progression. But here, it feels like everything that was built in the first film has been forgotten, and instead, it takes a step backward. In a movie that drags on this much, it's hard to keep the audience engaged. The story itself might be interesting, but when presented this slowly, it does nothing but lose the audience's interest.On the other hand, casting Lady Gaga was a good choice. When I first heard about it, I thought it was a bit risky, but her performance surprised me. The emotional depth and charisma she brought to her character helped salvage the film to some extent. She managed to build a nice chemistry with Joaquin Phoenix, and this is one of the film's strongest aspects. However, even this chemistry isn't enough to make up for the film's overall sluggishness and shortcomings. Gaga's performance is strong, but the disjointed script and pacing prevent her from truly shining.As a sequel, one of this film's biggest failures is its inability to sustain the spirit and energy of the first movie. The dark atmosphere and deep character explorations that were so central to the first film are almost nonexistent here. Instead, we are given a more superficial narrative and storyline. This makes it harder for the audience to connect with the characters, leaving a sense of emptiness by the end of the film. This is especially disappointing for characters that were so well-developed in the first movie. As a viewer, I wanted to see the characters evolve, but this film doesn't deliver that.In the end, this movie turned out to be a disappointing experience, one I had high expectations for. While there are some strengths, like the musical scenes and Lady Gaga's performance, overall, the movie falls short due to its slow pace, disorganized story, and inability to recapture the magic of the first film. If the pacing had been better managed and the story more focused, this film might have been much more successful. But as it stands, unfortunately, it falls far short of meeting the audience's expectations.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Don\\'t get me wrong, this film is by no means an outstanding sequel, but it makes a statement in its own right.The positives:\\nJoaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga\\'s performances were stellar, and the musical score added an ominous tone that fit the film well.Music:\\nSome viewers have complained about the disjointed transitions between the plot and musical sequences. I also found these moments quite jarring, but part of me feels this may have been intentional. The film is bleak and disturbing, and the musical interludes, while out of place at times, might have been meant to reflect that. However, the musical segments could have been trimmed, given the film\\'s already lengthy runtime. Songs like \"If You Go Away\" and \"To Love Somebody\" felt overly sentimental, in my opinion.Film duration:\\nThe movie is quite long, and some sequences could have been shortened. There were numerous drawn-out scenes of Arthur simply walking or staring out from inside a car, which slowed the pacing.Character development:\\nLee\\'s character felt underdeveloped. I\\'m not sure if this was the director\\'s intention, but it left me wanting more depth.In summary:\\nThis is an unusual film that deserved a stronger ending, though I don\\'t believe it warranted the level of criticism it received.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Back in 2019, Writer/Director Todd Phillips teamed with actor Joaquin Phoenix to create an interesting, dark, multi-level character named Arthur Fleck in JOKER. This character was so compelling that Phoenix (rightfully) won the Oscar for best Actor and Phillips (rightfully) was nominated for a Best Screenplay Oscar. So, what do Phillips and Phoenix do to \"up the ante\" in the inevitable sequel?Why, make it a musical, of course.Picking up after the events of the first film where Arthur Fleck is awaiting trial while incarcerated at Arkham Asylum for the murders he committed in the first film, JOKER: FOLIE A DEUX focuses on the relationship that Arthur strikes up with \"SuperFan\" Lee Qunizel (Lady GaGa) and the sparks and chaos that ensue.Or do they? For this movie focuses on the blurred lines of fantasy vs. Reality that these 2 live in - and the musical numbers emphasize the fantasy portion of it.One needs to be a very certain type of viewer to enjoy the musical aspect of this film - you need to be a Dark Comic Book Movie fan that also enjoys Movie Musicals of the 1950\\'s. This just happens to be me, so I really enjoyed the Musical numbers that were grounded in \"reality\" (at least, the reality of these 2 characters) while also helping to move the story forward and to enhance the characters and the relationships of Arthur and Lee.As for the performances, Phoenix is terrific (of course) as Arthur. The problem is that one is going to judge his performance against his previous, Oscar-winning performance and it just doesn\\'t measure up (mostly because of the script - more on that later). However, his singing is a pleasant surprise. Sure, at times it falls into \"talk singing\" (aka Rex Harrison in MY FAIR LADY), but Phoenix acts his way through the songs and the roughness of his voice in his musical numbers works for his character.However, Phoenix has an issue in this movie that he didn\\'t in the first Joker film, he has a VERY strong performer to work against and the performance that Lady Gaga gives as Lee just might be a Oscar worthy performance here. Her Lee Quinzel is layered, nuanced and interesting and (as one might imagine) she slips in and out of the musical numbers with ease and when it is her time to shine, musically, she shows that she is...well...Lady Gaga!Where this movie really fails, though, is in the script that Phillips wrote with Scott Silver. This film is, in essence, a courtroom drama - and a thin one at that - and Phillips and Silver just don\\'t have the depth of character or circumstance that makes one care much about what is happening on the screen and though Phoenix and GaGa try mightily to elevate this film above the thin script that they are given, this film ultimately, falls apart like a cheap shirt in the wash.And...don\\'t get me started about the \"deus ex machina\" ending that seemed to come out of nowhere!So...if you\\'re a musical theater and dark comic book movie person this film just might intrigue you, if not, knock 2 points off my grade below.Letter Grade: B (for me), probably a C for everyone else.7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to theBank (ofMarquis)',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie a Deux continues with the story of Arthur Fleck(Joaquin Phoenix), after the events of Joker(2019). Wrestling with his dual identity as the Joker, Arthur meets & falls in love with Harley Quinn(Lady Gaga), while serving his sentence at Arkham State Hospital.Joker: Folie a Deux is a pretty good film. It's definitely not terrible, like most critics & viewers are saying. Director Todd Phillips has given us a movie, that takes many bold swings by playing with multiple genres. However, it doesn't really commit to any single genre & that's the film's downfall. Making the sequel to one of the best character studies of a major comic book villain, a musical, was definitely not the way to go. The songs are not at all memorable & completely unnecessary. Each time either Joker or Harley Quinn break into song, I was just waiting for the song to end. The production design by Mark Friedberg during the elaborate song & dance sequences, are incredible & look even better in IMAX. Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal as Arthur Fleck. If Phoenix was given the same dark thriller genre that he had to work with in the predecessor, he would have knocked it out of the park. Because it's a musical, Joaquin Phoenix's performance suffers because, he doesn't really have flawless singing skills. Lady Gaga is spectacular as Lee Quinzel. Brendan Gleeson is great as Jackie Sullivan. Catherine Keener is superb as Maryanne Stewart. Zazie Beetz is incredible as Sophie Dumond. Harry Lawtey & Leigh Gill are perfect as Harvey Dent & Gary Puddles, respectively. The supporting cast is effective. Joker: Folie a Deux is worth a watch for fans of Joker(2019). However, keep your expectations super low. You will be disappointed but, at least you won't be extremely disappointed.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"The movie starts with a very random comic sketch written on Joker about him and his shadow and how it was his shadow all along who did all the crime and blamed it on him. The scene abruptly cuts to Arkham Asylum where Arthur Fleck is now on medication. He has no zeal to tell jokes anymore, maybe he gave up, or the medications were working on him.Later in the movie, he meets another cellmate Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga) and they started talking and he finds out how she is a big time joker supporter, and how she believes in him. Our movie starts with this one statement now, and the movie is all about how Arthur Fleck fights with his own reality.Coming to the performance, Joaquin Phoenix did it again, absolutely brilliant with his Joker and Arthur Fleck both. This time, a lot of things happened in his mind, rather than in real life but in different way and thay brings out the madness of his character. Lady Gaga on the other hand, could not show her acting skills much because she was busy singing everywhere abruptly which was not at all required to be honest.According to me, making it a musical was not at all a good decision, there was a lot of missed opportunities in the movie. When the story tries to grab you with the performance of the actors, somehow an abrupt song breaks the flow so even if the songs were beautifully written and sung, they were not at all required because they ruined the little left plot in the movie.The songs somehow drags the movie down because there could have been gripping and chilling dialogues instead which would have made so much sense in those scenes. It was 'madness of two' and all you can see is one getting mad, in all those songs, that is the audience.Overall, the ending will surprise you if you think about it in depth. The ending gives you the hint of the origin of the Joker we all know, we all love. In the end, the movie is not as bad as the people have told you, and not as good as you have thought it to be. It was a too flashy attempt to glorify an already successful movie and it went bad.Having all that said and heard, I want to tell you to watch the movie and decide yourself, if that is the Joker you really deserved?\",\n",

I will say the movie might surprise fans of the first movie because of some stylistic differences but those that can look beyond all the musical numbers might find a movie very similar to the first in terms of grit, acting performances and the anti-superhero movie character study style. I will say that the movie is good but not great, it is brutal shocking bloody and includes a very new version of Harley Quin that fits very well into the sort of movie that the Joker is. I think this might get more love from critics than fans because Joaquins performance expands to show musical theater chops in a way that we haven't seen from him before. There is a lot that is memorable with this movie. The shocking ending is something and though the movie is very much in the same spirit as it's predecessor it feels like a different kind of film.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Since the moment Folie à Deux was announced I feel like the narrative around it has been that it just didn't need to happen. I would combat that by saying no movie has ever had to happen, the first Joker didn't have to happen but in this movies case I just really struggled to understand the appeal behind continuing the story of that first film. There was just something so beautiful to me about Joker being its own self-contained story and I was mainly worried that the existence of this sequel would undermine so many plot points from the first film that would be better left ambiguous. It's a flawed experience for sure but I kept waiting for the moment that it would lose me and it honestly never came.I think a large part of that comes down to Todd Phillips' wholly unique vision for this movie. It by no means always works but it always kept my interest. Making this a musical is a bold idea but made total sense to me given how important music was to the first film. I personally liked that it was a jukebox musical, I thought it kept the tone closer to that of the first movie, and as obviously great as Lady Gaga was in those moments Joaquin Phoenix brought out that aspect of the character in outstanding ways. I just found those sequences to be inserted in really clunky ways and for as impressively realised as they are it just left me feeling like a lot of them could've been removed and it wouldn't really have affected the flow that much.Honestly I would say for the first hour or so I as totally onboard with what this movie was trying to do. Everything that takes place within the confines of the prison were brutally well realised and I feel like it gives us a version of the Joker we've never seen before. It made this movie feel more standalone and less like it's trying to retread the beats from the original. It's after the first hour, when we get more scenes outside of the prison where things start to become uneven. It essentially becomes 3 or 4 films in one and it massively bogs down the pacing. It can drag considerably because so many scenes feel like they're unnecessarily long and it made me not as consistently engaged as I wanted to be. The court room stuff took a while to become interesting for me but once it did I found a lot of the call backs to the first film to be more impactful and less like it was just a recap of events.I also don't know that I ever found the insertion of Gaga's Harley Quinn to be as successful as it could've been. I thought her and Phoenix had great chemistry and I always bought the connection between those characters but I never really felt like she came into her own. Her appearances become more sporadic as the film goes on and I kept waiting for the moment where she had a real impact on the actual events but it never came to be. I wasn't a huge fan of how her arc ended and I have to be honest and say that the final scene left me very mixed. It's a bold swing that did have an effect on me and I can see what Phillips was going for but nothing in this film or the first one leads me to believe that this is what they were ultimately building towards.From the moment Folie à Deux was announced I questioned if Joker really needed a sequel and having seen the actual film now I still don't feel like I have an answer to that question. It is a very interesting experience that mostly held my attention and I ultimately admired the story that Todd Phillips was trying to tell here. Nothing about this film offends me as a fan of the first but I couldn't help but scratch my head at some of the decisions that were made. For as many scathing reviews as this movie has been getting, I am surprised that I left feeling more positive than most. Maybe this movie should never have been made but for better or worse I don't think it's going to leave my mind anytime soon.\",\n",

However, I felt like Todd Phillips did a wonderful job crafting a true comic book movie here. The musical number cutaways not only made the movie feel more like a comic book but also depicted well the insanity of Joker and Harley Quinn, especially JokerI may be a little biased here because I enjoy musicals and comic book movies but, I would have thought less of Todd Phillips if he hadn't showcased the talents of Lady Gaga. This is a great movie, see it for yourself and make your own judgment. I'm happy as a clown that I did.\",\n",

This seems right. It seems to suddenly turn around and realize there was this trope behind the camera that it now sees, consequence. But it still stokes a little bit of the cult fire, even if it blows much of it out.I'm happy and proud to have watched it. It went a direction it should've.\",\n",

I believe it is a glimpse into a cross-section of society that is very well done and, from what I am seeing, successful in its purpose. I didn't love the musical, even more so the ending.

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux is a bit challenging to watch. Polarizing in the sense the film lacks the punch of its predecessor. However, it does excel in certain aspects.Set two years after the first film, the story follows Arthur, in a psychiatric ward and on trial. His life takes a turn after meeting Harleen Quinzel (Gaga), a fellow patient infatuated with his alter ego, Joker. Together, they spiral into a surreal, hallucinatory world, blending reality with vivid musical fantasies reminiscent of classic Hollywood musicals.Despite the singing and dancing, the movie struggles to be an effective musical.The story falls flat due to weak writing. The characters felt underdeveloped and the film's attempts at social commentary were kinda blunt, lacking the subtlety and depth that gave the first installment its emotional weight.Despite its shortcomings, Folie à Deux is not without its merits.Phoenix shines. Again. His performance is commendable; shows his incredible range and commitment to the character. Gaga was good and her singing was better. Their infusion in music sequences lends the film some quality, giving it the essence of a dark musical.The background score was really good, added another layer of depth maintaining the class of the first film. Although the selection of the songs were not on point and pretty forgettable.The background settings were satisfactory but could have offered greater variety, especially considering it is a musical.Cinematography was superb. Lighting, bursts of smokes/mists pound you with rich hues of blue, red, teal, yellow etc. All the while immersing you in some dark musical spectacle.Phillips has done well in directing a film that has great cinematography/visuals with splendid acting performances but could've given more in creating an engaging storyline. He has kept his standards though.Joker: Folie à Deux certainly lacks the spark of the previous film. It ends up prioritizing style over substance. Musical film fans would wanna enter with mild expectations but joker fans would be happy to see their character in all its glory. Nevertheless, quality acting, stunning cinematography, decent direction and a solid background score, make the film worth watching.\",\n",

Those scenes show him happy for once, in love, so the music fits his mood perfectly. This film isn\\'t really about the Joker anyway; it\\'s more about the symbol he represents. Plus, age-wise, Arthur\\'s too old to be Batman\\'s Joker. For me, it beats the prequel by about 0.5 points - more layered, more interesting.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux is a film with slightly different kind of musical elements. The film explores themes of myth, perception, rehabilitation, devotion, and self-sabotage. The plot of this film only discusses what happened after the first film, and in terms of execution it feels sloppy without a clear conclusion. There are too many musical elements in this film, but sometimes the placement and timing are not quite right, which disrupts the plot. We won't see the madness that we saw in the first film often in this film, it's only limited to Arthur's imagination. In terms of character development, it is like in the first film, only Arthur is having an identity crisis again. The cinematography is really really pretty, especially during the musical scenes, with the coloring making it feel a little colorful. In terms of production design, nothing has changed, it's still good. The soundtrack music is really pleasant to listen to, especially combined with the suspense scoring. Joaquin Phoenix's acting is definitely very good, and Lady Gaga's acting is quite impressive. Overall, this isn't a bad film but it's not good either.\",\n",

Now, his sequel is released reprising the role of Joker aka Joaquin Phoenix and newly added his love interest Harley Quinn played by Lady Gaga himself. I come straight to the point , i didn't find this sequel better than the original or came close to it. This is morely about a trail with the musical essence which was filled to the top. However, it is not bad i would say. I was expecting something else and they give us something else which is not settle in my vision. Although, the music was good , the direction was supremely good, but the writer fell short in the storyline i think i was a good plot about the trail and all but it will be sweet if it's done and sorted till the interval not stretched to the climax. As it is a musical one , it was beautifully executed. If i talked about the performance, they both preachingly delivers so good man. I have no doubt about Joaquin but Lady Gaga is so good performer too. Exceptional. As its starts you will fall into their world of joker. Simply outstanding. But came up short with the plot and the elements. Not a masterpiece like the Joker (2019) but a decent one.One Time Watch. Recommended.\",\n",

This movie isn't perfect at all and neither was the first movie, but this movie has soul and artistry. This clearly wasn't just some product pushed out of a machine like wonderbread. There was someone behind this that clearly cared about the end product. Look, maybe you don't like musicals, that's okay. Maybe this movie isn't for you. Not every movie has to be for everyone.The songs in this are fun and mesh very well with the time period. Joaquin phoenix puts on yet another great performance along with a very good performance by lady gaga (I never thought I would type that). I do wish there was more mind-bending segments and social commentary like there was in the first movie admittedly. Maybe if they were included alongside the musical numbers it would be too much.Ultimately, I liked this a whole lot. It had its issues that held it back from being an 8 or a 9, but it takes a lot of guts to make a sequel that isn't just more of the same.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie a Deux really doesn't deserve the hate it's getting. Sure it has it's issues, but for the most part it is a very solid if slightly unnecessary sequel.The biggest issue with this film is most definitely the story. It is painfully long considering it is devoid of any significant meaning or drive. I think it meanders far too much and doesn't add much to the first film. When it finally does get down to its point it is too rushed and as a result loses most of its impact. I was expecting a film bringing Harley and Joker together on screen in a grounded setting to lead to a more interesting story, and I think they missed a trick here.What really can't be faulted with this film though are the performances of Phoenix and Gaga. This is no surprise as they are both brilliant, but the chemistry they share is also incredible. Everything they did with these characters from the design to the creative choices I thoroughly enjoyed.Then there's the musical element. Perhaps people were unprepared for a musical? The patrons of the theatre I was in certainly were, as every song outbreak was greeted with audible signs and murmurs. Personally I thought this was one of the best parts! Lady Gaga singing? What's not to love. And the musical element just really works for these characters and the relationship they had and really complimented that well. A bold choice but one that really worked for me.Aside from the lacklustre story I really don't understand the pile on for this film. Great characters and performances, inventive storytelling with the musical elements, and a good tone and vibe to the whole thing.\",\n",

Then he finds out that it was really all a show and did it purely for others but never for himself. That is for me the reason that i think its a good movieThe funny thing is that in the first movie you really get to know him as a crazy man with very weird twists. But in this movie you're kind of used to him and he suddenly becomes normal. I wonder if people like that or not.And in the end; he is a good actor.\",\n",

Joker falls madly in love with her and fantasizes about getting out of jail to have a life together; however, she ends up breaking his heart by rejecting him towards the end of the events.I personally think that this sequel of the Joker disappointed many for not continuing along the path that characterized the first one, that is, we practically see no scenes of violence or where the Joker gets upset. Let's remember that his defense mechanism to escape reality is fantasy with Harley and singing.We have a Joker anesthetized by love who is capable of doing anything to satisfy his partner's desires.I think that the singing scenes, particularly the duets between Joker and Harley, are well done and contribute a lot to the story; they make a good couple on screen.\",\n",

The songs get more dramatic and crazy as the film goes on and I think this was a very good way of showing just how crazy Arthur truly is. To add, the performances of the musical scenes of these films are purely brilliant. Lady Gaga shows just how much of a talented artist she is and Joaquin Phoenix truly holds his own.Although the ending has been seen as disappointing by some, I think this ending opens up this story to be expanded even more and for us to be opened to a new world of The Joker.Overall, Joker Folie à Deux is a very entertaining watch with strong lead performances.

It was good in the aspects it always was. Though this is a sequel, we really shouldn\\'t be comparing this with the first Joker. Folie à Deux embraces the road of sharing trauma and how to deal with it correctly while focusing on a romance between the leads. When I say it was visually amazing, I mean it. The film perfectly captured the acting, the visual essence, and its expectations the first film had set. There were some scenes that screamed \"mind-blowing,\" and the music. Oh God, the music. Was the music good? Sure. But was it too much? Oh, absolutely. The music was too much. TOO MUCH. Don\\'t get me wrong, yes, I love the different take on this movie by adding original songs. But they overdid that by jamming it with songs that weren\\'t needed in certain scenes. Not every scene needs a song. I\\'ll try to phrase it without spoiling. Joker: Folie à Deux is, in itself, amazing. The visuals, the acting, the score behind, the sets, even the dialogues maybe. But the songs were a bit too much in terms of quantity. No hate to the creators, but honestly, it ruined the entire experience. I believe taking a more selective approach could\\'ve been stronger, letting the story breathe with the right dialogue moments. Oh, and there\\'s the big miss that the writers did. The first film was about how Joker symbolized the struggles of the common or the low folk, while in the sequel, you stripped him of that title. This made absolutely no sense in any way, and this is the one thing that acts as a complete opposite to what the first film stood for. But hey, all this is my opinion. Some might like the movie, some might not. It\\'s the whole point of a review that it\\'s your own opinion.I would give it a 7.8 out of 10.',\n",

I know this doesn't stand high as the OG Joker but but but the amount of hate this film is getting is too much I would say it wasn't a disaster but also not as outstanding as the first part. I love the creative choice of Todd Philips wanted to add some drama in the life of Joker as to express his dramatic life but the music it didn't go well sometimes it hits us but mostly i was getting annoyed that plan was good but the execution wasn't up to the mark. As we see in LaLa Land the music takes the movie forward as the story line and each music had its own way of expressing the story but here it fails. Besides the creative choices talking about the story, the plot the story was the X factor here whether it was Joker or Arthur Fleck who committed those crimes whether the Joker is a fiction in Arthur's mind or is it the real Arthur the movie puts you in this dilemma. I think the makers should have focused more on this aspect than putting unnecessary songs. And the ending was too confusing and a cliffhanger it forces you to think whether Joker is a person or thinking/character/a symbol/an image. All in all if you are expecting any more drama than the actual plot I wouldn't recommend it but if you love to think from the makers or the directors perspective what they want to convey through that story then you should go for it.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Folie à Deux is not so much a double madness as it is a madness reversal.The success of the first Joker lies in the fact that its dark representations and interpretations profoundly elicit the dark side of the public's heart. When people see their dark side, fear and have to face it. The Joker is the best point of expression, even its dark influence far beyond the director and the main actor's expression. Then the subsequent fear has to be saved and glorified by the director and production attempts.Although it is said to be a double madness, it is actually the first step after the Joker's madness controls Arthur, the director wants the second madness to be Arthur controlling the Joker back. But the director and production underestimated the reality of the darkness. This attempt to return to social normality was not accepted.Or the viewers who came to watch Joker 2 to challenge their values by making it even darker were forced to go back and watch the reversal. It's madness on the part of the director, but it wasn't accepted.What I saw was the director and producer's fear and redemption of the impact and deep darkness of the first movie.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Same vibe as the first one. Making a movie about what society makes you feel sometimes when nobody really cares about what you are really saying and feeling, feeling like you are not really heard by anyone. This one is more about a love story that many people can relate to; when you meet someone who sees you, hears you, and is able to read you like you always want to show to the real world. This person sees the true colors of yourself. It\\'s called love. This carries a profound message like the first but with a different touch that makes it comforting.The filming of the movie is sublime, and you can clearly see the high budget they had with these shots. Joaquin was perfect again in the role, and it\\'s easy for the viewers to have empathy with this character. Lady Gaga was a nice addition for sure, for her voice alone but sometimes it was too much... Let me explain.I feel like it was a \"dramatic musical movie.\" At certain times, it makes you feel like they just want to show off Lady Gaga\\'s voice when it wasn\\'t really needed in the scene. Joaquin has this aspect too. I found many times that I was bored by that aspect during the film. Don\\'t get me wrong, I like some musical comedies when they are done at the right time and the movie is directly going for that direction, but I really feel like Joker Part 2, a DC movie, was not really the place to show as many musical scenes like that. I mean, I\\'m pretty sure if they replaced these parts with real conversation and profound scripts that add more value than just songs, it would be a far better movie. I haven\\'t read any reviews yet, but I think I\\'m not the only one who thinks that. Besides that, the first one was a better film, no doubt about that in many ways but because Joker 1 was excellent, the expectations for the second part were surely pretty high, and I think for that reason alone, you will have some disappointment about certain things in the movie that in your head you would have done differently to make it more interesting. Sometimes it was a bit too much political, too much rules but I can understand that direction because of the plot. It may had been better again if it was less intense in that regard but I think they have also done a great job because it was a psychological drama in a sense so it was needed for sure.It had some pretty intense scenes. Some of them made my heart pound like crazy, creating a rollercoaster of emotions just like the other movie. I cried also, don\\'t really know why but at the beginning, I found myself too deep in the story, feeling like Arthur (Joaquin) deserved to be treated better than that. I found the instant connection he had with Lee so touching, and it made me smile and feel really comforted as well just like a feeling of warm in the winter.This was an intense film that makes you think about your relationships in life and how you treat people around you, specially people that are different from the \"normality\". You definitely feel the buzz a bit after you exit the cinema, and it makes you rethink the whole movie. It opens discussions with other cinephiles about your experience when watching the movie, and I think it is really well done for that reason too. I\\'d give it a 7 out of 10. Love it or hate it, the purpose of cinema and the essence of art that they capture is on point, you cannot deny it. That\\'s life...Viewed on October 8, 2024.',\n",

So much potential lost.Gaga was good.. not what was needed for this version of joker in my opinion. In fact the musical element just got annoying as the film progressed.

       "    'Review': \"Let me start by saying I wasn't all that impressed with Phillips' original Joker movie. It wasn't a bad movie, but it seemed quite simply like Taxi Driver and The Killing Joke smashed together. Not wholly original, and I came away wondering whether the Joker character really needs a backstory or justification for existing. I mean, isn't the lack of a backstory what made Heath Ledger's portrayal in the Dark Knight so appealing? The enigmatic agent of chaos who just wanted to watch the world burn - for no apparent reason? Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal, while skilfully done, was clearly not that Joker, nor was he meant to be.Yet somehow, it's as if the audience of Joker: Folie à Deux didn't get the memo on that. It seems like many original Joker fans, somewhat bewilderingly, expected this movie to be his glorious transformation into the criminal mastermind who would go on to be Batman's arch nemesis. If you haven't yet seen the sequel, and that's what you expect, you will be disappointed. But ask yourself - would that even make sense? At what point in the original did you believe Joaquin Phoenix's Joker to be a criminal mastermind, who could competently stay several steps ahead of a well-educated billionaire vigilante who's described as 'the world's greatest detective'?This movie is fine. It's not brilliant, and it's not awful. The musical numbers go on quite a bit and don't really add anything meaningful to the story. But I think it's a real shame for people to totally misunderstand the Joker character being set up in the first movie, and then hate on the sequel for not making him an inconsistent mess. When you read other reviews claiming there is no character development - what they mean is they didn't get the character development they wanted. Owning up to ones crimes and reconnecting with ones humanity IS character development. Realising that a need for love and connection in a brutally uncaring world has driven you to pretend to be someone you're not and led to even more division, destruction and brutality IS character development.People will probably hate this review for pointing that out, and that's fine. Everyone's entitled to an opinion. But at least be honest about your reasons for having those opinions.\",\n",

The first film was a fantastic exploration of Arthur Fleck's descent into insanity and violence. So what to do with the second...?The choice to make it a musical was bold. It captures Fleck's need for escape, and the twisted romanticism of his relationship with Harley.Unfortunately, the strategy falls flat at times, with the musical sequences dragging on and the plot being very thin. Phoenix is once again amazing as Fleck, showing the full range of his talent. Brendan Gleeson plays the cruel Irish prison guard like it is second nature and Lady Gaga is fine as Harley (but not outstanding - Margot Robbie has nothing to worry about).I would give this film 6/10, except for the ending, which is (in my opinion) brilliant, thus earning the film an additional point. I cannot say more about the ending without spoilers, other than it fixes one of the issues that I had with the original Joker film.\",\n",

One thing for sure the acting is once again faultless, whether he (Pheonix) wins again is a matter of opnion. Lady Gaga is solid as Harley and gave her a more sultry demeanour, then her predecessor.There are times again like the first you are almost cheering the anti hero and that's a testament to Pheonix and his performance. Script and storytelling wise it does fall flat as it really doesn't move forward. Set soley pretty much in the prison and courtroom it seems its rehashing the inner demons of Arthur which we already are aware of.Also Folie A Duex is almost lost in its meaning as it seems only an after thought.

       "    'Review': 'To start off, I\\'ll say that I absolutely loved the original Joker (2019), like most of the other reviewers have stated. This film is something different entirely from the previous entry, which was specified early on when it was first announced. With it being revealed as a \"musical\", fans of the first film were immediately turned off, which is understandable - at first glance. It may be hard to head into this knowing the prior information as it may be discouraging, however, the film pulls it off in more ways than one.This is Todd Phillip\\'s interpretation of the character of The Joker. As a director, he does have the right to interpret the character in any way he chooses. I fully supported the way he explored the character in the first film. I still support his choices here, because in reality, the sequel has more of the same themes and elements of the original. The film is bold in a lot of ways, changing the style here and there to focus on a new aspect of Arthur Fleck\\'s mental illness, being music, and expressing himself in that new way. Of course the musical aspects are not for everyone, and it\\'s going to turn a lot of people away, but it\\'s important to give it a chance as I did. Did people just forget that in the first entry Arthur danced, sang, and even listened to old songs to get in the mood to be Joker? The themes are just stronger in this film.Joker (2019) is my favorite film ever made, so seeing the reviews pour in so negatively for the sequel of course had me worried. After seeing it for myself, I can confidently say that people are severely overreacting. Whether it\\'s fans of the original, Batman comic book fans, or just people who hate musicals. I\\'m not a huge musical fan myself either, and it was a bit difficult to adjust to this after the first song began, but with time it did weave into the story perfectly. Arthur and Harley bounce off of each other so perfectly, and they feel like a real dysfunctional couple. They share the screen in such a unique way that it fits so well into the universe that Todd Phillips created.As for the acting, Joaquin Phoenix is again fantastic, Lady Gaga isn\\'t as terrible as people say she is either, and everyone else in the film pulls together to make it one cohesive story. There are still emotional gut punches, there are shocking reveals, and there are even funny moments too. This is completely different from the original, but it is also very similar in a lot of thematic ways. The cinematography is outstanding like the first film, the sets are amazing like the first film, and the story is pretty good all things considered.So, the bottom line, is it perfect? Not even close. Is it worth watching? Of course. It\\'s not that bad, and that\\'s coming from a die hard fan of the original. It\\'s experimental, it tries a lot of new things, it succeeds for the majority of the time, and fails few and far between. As for the whole ending debacle, I thought it was a fine ending. It was shocking of course, as I\\'m sure that was the intention, but it was a fine ending to the story. Give it a chance, maybe rewatch it again if you have to. Look at it with an open mind, like we all did with the first film. 7/10.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Having watched Joker: Folie A Deux, the critique makes so much sense, but so does all the praise. While I totally get the outrage and disappointment of the audience with this one, this much anticipated sequel of the award-winning 2019 banger is by no means a trash or a waste, not even close, and I\\'ll tell you why Joker 2 is not as bad as people say!It is not Todd Philips\\' failure, but sheer bravery to chalk out this movie like he did, when it could have been so different and so much more, in so many ways. I mean no one would remotely think of filming a psychotic drama as a musical, given the amount of constraints one would face in execution, but Todd did; and mind you, he not just did it, he outsmarted me, pulling me in for something I was not ready for.Joaquin, capitalizing on a commendable support from Gaga, blew it out of the park as he makes it increasingly difficult for me to take my eyes off him at many points! He continues to do full justice to the fractured soul of Arthur Fleck who still struggles to find and justify his true identity amidst the chaos of the past and the present. Gaga was a delight to watch as well!So what accounts for the mass disappointment?This is one hell of a difficult movie to absorb along with its cinematic intricacies. NOT EVERYBODY WILL LIKE IT. If you CANNOT catch and appreciate the subtle nuances that Todd and Joaquin navigate through the entirety of the movie\\'s duration, you WILL NOT appreciate the beauty of the movie.I feel that a good majority of Indian audience and \"moviegoers\" is just not ready for Joker 2.Oh and talking of beauty, some shots of the movie are such treats to the eyes owing to a masterful cinematography.While the loaded and very frequent songs, music, and dance might annoy you (and remind you of a typical bollywood low-grade romance drama), it is well-executed for two reasons - first, the songs! The music (including the background score) is wonderful. Second, the music-movie-integration! If you pay attention to all songs played throughout, you will see how they couple magically to the elements of the movie, and to fragments of Arthur\\'s soul, as they depict the characters\\' voice, both figuratively and literally. However, there is no denying that the loaded musical element kind of takes away the spark that this movie \"could have\" ignited otherwise.Joker and Joker 2 take two very different paths to approach the same goal - The Character of Joker, and it is this difference that needs to be acknowledged, and respected. While the prequel prepared the audience for a banger with its gritty, dark and psychotic approach, the sequel seeks to bring home the central study of character, delved only more deeply this time, via a musical (again, that\\'s brave!), but that doesn\\'t mean we have to hate it. While the benchmark set by the first movie was just too damn high, the sequel has its own subtleties that MUST be appreciated. Again, its not just a musical that happens to be a sequel (or vice-versa), but its a good musical sequel.So why did I call it Joker 1.5?That\\'s because a sequel is something you need but this, I feel, is not a movie we necessarily needed. It is more of an offshoot that picks up right after the events of the first movie and then builds upon it. However, even though we didn\\'t need it, I am glad they made it; that\\'s exactly why its not a waste. If anything, it only navigates the character of Joker more profoundly and gives us deeper insights into how Arthur percieves himself. As the movie progressed, I found myself INSIDE Arthur\\'s struggle of finding himself and not just being a spectator; that\\'s exactly where the movie succeeded, that\\'s exactly where Joaquin succeeded (what an astonishing actor!) - in involving and capturing the audience in his own chaos.Its Joker 1.5 because while the Joker (the idea of it) is now out there in the world (with a profound influence on the masses), Arthur still finds himself very much confined and fractured within himself.And so the movie artfully brings out (yet again) the central idea that the Joker is not one man, its a concept, an idea! Arthur Fleck emerges as merely a conduit in whom that idea was born - all of that garnished with exceptional performance, great music, and a spectacular cinematography.What didn\\'t work out was the unfulfillment of people\\'s high expectations from the villain of Gotham, and obviously some structural and executional defects here and there in the movie; so much could have been so much better in so many ways. While the first half is still something you feel captivated by, the second half gradually makes you vulnerable to the idea of hating the movie.Therefore, it is only with a patient acknowledgement of cinematic nuances of Joker 2 that you will appreciate this well-made sequel which struggles a lot to live up to its prequel, and could have been far better, but it isn\\'t.',\n",

It brings to life what someone like the Joker would actually be experiencing and gives an honest voice to mental illness.

       "    'Review': 'The acting by Phoenix and Gaga is top tier. Whilst people currently dislike it due to it having an alternate musical genre people will realise the masterpiece that has been created using an alternate genre not following the same niche that has been the meta for the previous decade. The songs are perfectly spaced adding an enjoyable element to continue to register the audiences engagement throughout the film. Furthermore the movie offers and amazing deep dive into insanity and a split personality whilst offering an in depth and entertaining court room scene that offers the perfect mix of drama, comedy and suspense.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"The movie brings novelty, not relying on the formula of the previous. It's a story about suffering, a true drama about how cruel real life is. To make it softer, the musical format and a poetic narrative are adopted. It is a great work of art, but mass audiences expecting fun, excitement, or some repetition of the original formula will get very disappointed. What more real than a cruel world, full of obstacles, full of twists, with an unpredictable plot, and where what matters are not individuals, but the image they project? Still, the movie is more superficial than the previous, or at least more subtle on its depth, leaving for reflective audiences to get the deeper meanings.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'I attended an advanced screening of Joker: Folie à Deux (2024) this evening. The storyline follows Arthur Fleck after the events of the first film, framed as a sort of prison drama. He is set to be reevaluated for his crimes and must return to court. In order to defend himself, he must convince the world that there are two versions of him: Arthur Fleck and The Joker. As he prepares for his trial, he meets a woman who changes his life forever-but will she help his case, or send him spiraling in an entirely new direction?Directed by Todd Phillips (The Hangover), the film stars Joaquin Phoenix (Walk the Line), Lady Gaga (A Star is Born), Catherine Keener (Capote), Brendan Gleeson (28 Days Later), Steve Coogan (The Other Guys),!and Harry Lawtey (The Pale Blue Eye).I could watch a million of these Joker movies. Joaquin Phoenix is a national treasure, once again delivering an iconic performance of a man battling his inner demons-except now, love is the new demon in his life. His seamless transformation from The Joker to Arthur Fleck and back is a masterclass in acting. The entire cast delivers tremendous performances, and every scene Phoenix shares with Lady Gaga and Brendan Gleeson is masterfully crafted. Their dialogue, mannerisms, and chemistry are pitch-perfect for the story.The filmmaking here is top-notch, with stunning cinematography, lighting, and camera work. While some of the musical numbers were hit or miss, certain songs were perfect for fans who understand the Joker\\'s inner turmoil. One song in particular, \"The Joker Is Me,\" is an absolute standout-a 10/10 moment that resonates deeply with the audience. There\\'s also a courtroom scene featuring \"Mr. Puddles\" that\\'s cinematic gold. The writing is sharp, with lines like \"no more singing\" serving as a clever relationship metaphor. The ending is completely unexpected, making the film even more enjoyable.In conclusion, Joker: Folie à Deux isn\\'t quite as good as the first film, but it stands on its own as a unique, compelling piece of cinema. I\\'d score it an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"The Joker 2 is simply a better film than the first one in my opinion.The original was well made but to me felt very derivative.It didn't capture me like it did many others.But this sequel was brilliant.This is how the story had to end if it was set apart from the usual batman storyline.This is about Arthur Fleck not Bruce Wayne.And it was great to see a very nasty person get the ending he definitely deserved.The Joker ridiculously became a hero to a lot of misguided people after the first film and it was sad to see his image alongside rather ridiculous quotes on some Facebook pages.The use of songs was genius and Lady Ga Ga was pitch perfect is song and in her acting.Showing that she was also a maniac who wanted to use Joker as a conduit for her unfulfilled psychopathic desires.Harley Quin is a pathetic and nasty character here. No humour, one liners or comic violence in this version of her.Just a liar and user.This is a rare case of the sequel being much better than the last film.If you want to see Joker v Batman watch the Dark Knight. It was definitively done there.The Joker 2 is it's own thing.\",\n",

Who does this to an action packed film?So if they are to loose money over this production, then it's them choosing their own destiny. And please don't go watch this garbage.

       "    'Review': 'Joker: Folie à Deux promised to be a daring, artistic exploration of the Joker and Harley Quinn\\'s twisted dynamic. Instead, it serves up a baffling misstep: a musical. Yes, you read that right-a musical that somehow manages to gut the intensity and nihilism that made the original Joker such a cultural phenomenon. And not just a musical, but a disappointing one, where the songs are as forgettable as a dropped cup of coffee on a rainy day in Gotham.First off, the music. Remember when we thought Joker was about gritty realism, descending madness, and psychological torment? Well, Folie à Deux throws that out the window in favor of ...show tunes? The songs come across as half-baked, neither catchy nor deep, with no lasting resonance. You won\\'t leave the cinema humming the tunes because, frankly, there\\'s nothing to hum. It\\'s almost like the filmmakers thought, \"Hey, what if we took all the tension and grim beauty of the original and drowned it in unremarkable piano chords and lyrics that sound like they were penned in a day?\" The result is a soundtrack that feels as relevant to Joker\\'s original film noir aesthetic as a karaoke night in Arkham Asylum.The original Joker was a gripping exploration of mental illness, social decay, and the creation of a monster-a character study with noir influences, dark alleyways, and eerie lighting that matched its protagonist\\'s crumbling psyche. It thrived in its starkness, its minimalism, and its refusal to hold your hand or sing to you about what you\\'re meant to feel. But in Folie à Deux, we get elaborate musical numbers that feel misplaced, unnecessary, and at odds with the bleakness that worked so well before. It\\'s almost like someone saw La La Land and thought, \"You know what this gritty psycho-drama needs? Jazz hands!\" Because that\\'ll totally fit, right?The songs themselves do nothing to advance the story, nor do they provide insight into the characters. This isn\\'t Les Misérables where the musical format elevates the narrative to emotional heights. No, here the musical numbers act as speed bumps, derailing any chance at building tension or atmosphere. Just when you think you\\'re about to dive back into the intense psychological drama that made the first film so compelling, bam! Here comes an awkward duet that screams \"filler\" rather than \"emotional depth.\"And let\\'s talk about the character of Harley Quinn. Sure, she\\'s always been quirky, but the way her character is introduced and utilized in Folie à Deux feels like a watered-down Broadway version of the chaotic, unpredictable force of nature she\\'s supposed to be. Instead of pushing the Joker deeper into madness, she dances along in a subplot that seems only half-interested in the descent into insanity that Joker should be. Lady Gaga\\'s performance is fine, but it\\'s hard to tell if it\\'s the casting or the musical numbers themselves that make her feel like she belongs in a different movie altogether.If you went into Joker expecting the tragic elegance of noir, the dissonance of Folie à Deux will hit you like a clown car driving through a funeral procession. The dark cinematography, the brooding score from the first film, all replaced with flashy, glitzy numbers that don\\'t know what they\\'re doing in this story. There\\'s no thematic continuity.',\n",

Bizarre movie that i wouldn't recommend to anyone who is a fan of Batman or Joker characters , or the first movie.I know i am not the first person to say this but i did have high hopes for this based on the quality of the first one. I went opening night very excited to see the further development of the Joker character. Instead we get a weepy, weak, boring and broken wimp of a guy who not no resemblance to either the character we saw at the end of the first movie or the character from there comics/films.\",\n",

The plot consists of absolutely nothing, there's random singing for no reason every 5 minutes, it's randomly focusing on Lady Gaga for no reason... the only thing holding this together is Joaquin Phoenix's acting and the 7 minutes of normal movie scattered here and there.It's sad to see something that was so amazing in the first movie, be thrown into the garbage on the sequel. I truly hope the director Todd Phillips reflects on how badly he dropped the ball on this as there were a lot of fans that I sadly think will never come back after that travesty of a sequel...\",\n",

This film takes a different approach, with a significant portion of it revolving around music. While the first film delved into the darker, psychological aspects of Arthur Fleck's transformation into the Joker, this sequel shifts focus, blending musical elements and a romantic storyline involving Lady Gaga's character. This change in tone might not resonate with those hoping for a continuation of the intense, gritty atmosphere of the original.

The idea of turning the Joker's dark descent into a twisted love story musical is as jarring as it is ridiculous. Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga's singing feels more like nails on a chalkboard than any kind of entertainment. The plot? A nonsensical parade of random musical numbers that destroy any sense of pacing. This movie should come with a warning: If you liked the first Joker, Folie à Deux will ruin it for you.

Furthermore, there was a clear limit to Joker's potential by trying to not resemble Kieth Ledger's version. If there was more freedom to explore the dramatic nature of Joker's personality, then the film would have been more of a success. Throughout the film, there were a lot of mysteries that kept me entertained, but didn't turn out as satisfying as they did in the first movie.

It is so far away from the real origins of the original Joker and associated films...shocking!I can't remember the last time a film ended and the general vibe, from the audience, was so underwhelming. What were the scriptwriters and Directors thinking? They totally mishandled the stewardship of the franchise.The lead actors are good - but there was so much depth that could have been unlocked by those actors with the right script. So, it was a wasted opportunity and an experiment, gone wrong.If there is a 3rd film to the series - and I hope there is, then please make sure it returns to it's origins - instead of making another pantomime.\",\n",

Arkham inmates might as well have been given a spoonful of sugar to help their medicine go down! However, this really doesn't work as a savy cinematography trick that's convincing of psychosis either-more like a meloncholy Gotham crossed with Grease. It's just not the one that I want. Arthur Fleck is a pitiful Joker. This killer is given that tiresome 'victim' angle from which he never transcends into the legendary supervillain.

They spent a lot of time going over the causes of his trauma, his obsession with being on a late night talk show, and finally the outburst that would display his true madness. Chain-smoking aside, it was a good movie.THIS MOVIE, however, fell flat for me. As I noticed in the first movie, although I sort of enjoyed it, it seems the writers and actors had no prior knowledge of the characters. Harleen Quinzel was a psychologist whose sessions with Joker began to crack her sanity until she developed an obsessive love for him. In this movie, she's a patient with a Joker obsession, completely negating the nuance of their relathionship. It would've been far more interesting to see the original verion, interviewing Joker, beginning to empathize with him, and then develop an obsession; something more gradual rather than forced.While they introduced some interesting concepts like Harvey Dent and the movie's ending, I didn't enjoy the overall product.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"This movie felt like an empty shell of callbacks to the original, but with none of the heart or depth that made the first film great. They tried to reinvent it as a musical, but unlike the original, the awkward singing only made things worse. The songs felt out of place and did nothing to enhance the story, instead dragging the film down. It was packed with pointless filler scenes that failed to advance the plot or develop the characters. The writing was lazy, relying heavily on clichés and uninspired tropes. The characters were inconsistent, often acting in ways that made no sense just to force the plot forward. Several events were left unexplained, as if added in at the last minute to salvage the messy storyline. The ending was rushed, unsatisfying, and completely disconnected from the rest of the movie. Overall, it felt like a wasted effort that didn't do justice to the original.\",\n",

Law & Order is better on most weeks and , thankfully , also shorter.Is it a musical? Not really enough music to fit that bill and frankly the plot to Tommy made more sense.Is it a comic book movie? Maybe an unfinished mini series by Silver Wolf that just faded out from lack of interest I guess.Is it good? Lord no.No matter what it is you will come into this film expecting it will let you down in every way.Even if you come in hoping to just see the train wreck Todd created as a clear and blatant cash grab even in that it just falls flatter than a fart no one else ever hears.And that is it isn\\'t it? This was all just a cash grab by the production.Todd Phillips should have learned he was not very good with sequels the last time around.Gaga is no Margot Robbie in the role of Harley. Phoenix looks like he realized what he was into after he was already contractually obligated.Go re-watch the first. Go watch one of the Harley flicks or the as good as gold season 1 of the cartoon she had. Go clip your nails.

If there was ever a film Joaquin Phoenix should\\'ve backed out of at the last second, it should\\'ve been this one.The story itself breaks absolutely no new ground from the previous installment. It plays like a really bad finale to a sitcom where they revisit memory lane and invite all your favorite characters and revisit all your favorite moments, just to reduce it all to ruin with cheap sets, awful writing and bad music numbers. It\\'s also insane how much of this movie showcases smoking. Almost every shot is someone flexing their smoking habits and mad skills blowing and inhaling smoke.Speaking of main characters, the Joker himself (in make up and suit), is probably on screen for a total of maybe 10-15 minutes and does absolutely nothing besides smoke, throw tantrums, cry, and simp while Lady Gaga (who plays Harley Quinn) sings a groovy song on the side while smoking. The relationship between the two characters was at times amusing but overall nonsensical and absolutely ridiculous.The setting of this film mostly takes place in two places and both of them are about as dreary and miserable as it gets. Aside from some decent camera shots and effort made by a clearly exasperated actor that walked out in embarrassment at the Cannes film premiere (while the rest of the audience gave an 11 minute standing ovation), there is nothing good that can be said for this film.',\n",

This is a joke, not a movie.The original Joker was a dark, gritty masterpiece that explored the depths of mental illness and societal decay. The sequel, however, is a complete departure from that tone. The introduction of musical numbers feels forced and out of place, disrupting the film's narrative and destroying the atmosphere that made the first movie so compelling.The idea of turning a serious drama into a musical is a risky one that ultimately doesn't pay off. Musical films require strong songs and a well-crafted narrative to be successful. Joker 2 fails on both counts. The songs are forgettable, and the plot is weak.The performances in Joker 2 are also a mixed bag. While Joaquin Phoenix delivers a solid performance, the rest of the cast feels underwhelming. The supporting characters are one-dimensional and fail to make a lasting impression.In conclusion, Joker 2 is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. The introduction of musical elements is a significant misstep that undermines the film's narrative and tone. While the original Joker was a masterpiece, Joker 2 is a forgettable mess.\",\n",

I expected the sequel to elevate this experience, possibly even surpassing other cinematic giants of 2024, like \"Dune: Part Two.\" However, the reality of \"Joker 2\" transformed my excitement into a disheartening experience, leaving me feeling more like a \"real joker\" than an entertained moviegoer.From the moment the film began, it was clear that the tone was markedly different. The striking visuals and haunting score that characterized the first film felt absent, replaced by a muddled narrative that struggled to find its footing. While I had hoped for a deep exploration of Arthur\\'s psyche and the societal factors that shaped him, the sequel instead meandered through disjointed storylines and underdeveloped characters. It felt as though the filmmakers were attempting to replicate the success of the first film without fully understanding what made it resonate with audiences.One of my main disappointments was the handling of supporting characters. The original \"Joker\" featured a memorable cast that complemented Arthur\\'s journey, but \"Joker 2\" felt like a missed opportunity. Instead of providing depth and context, many characters were mere shadows of their potential, leaving me yearning for more substance. It was frustrating to watch as the film juggled various subplots, none of which managed to coalesce into a coherent narrative.Furthermore, the pacing of \"Joker 2\" left much to be desired. Moments that could have been powerful and impactful were often rushed, while less significant scenes dragged on. This uneven pacing contributed to a sense of disconnection from the characters, making it difficult for me to engage with their struggles. By the time the film reached its climax, I found myself emotionally detached, unable to invest in the outcome of Arthur\\'s journey.Visually, I had expected the same level of artistry that marked the first film. Instead, \"Joker 2\" seemed to rely on gimmicks rather than innovation. The cinematography lacked the striking imagery that made the original so iconic, and the score, once a haunting presence, felt generic and uninspired. The film failed to create the atmospheric tension that had drawn me into Arthur\\'s world in the first place.In conclusion, while my expectations for \"Joker 2\" were sky-high, the reality was a disheartening experience that left me feeling like a true joker. The film\\'s failure to deliver a compelling narrative, coupled with its underdeveloped characters and lackluster visuals, made for a disappointing viewing experience. As I reflect on my journey through this sequel, I can\\'t help but wish it had embraced the depth and artistry that made the original so unforgettable. For those seeking a continuation of Arthur Fleck\\'s story, be prepared for a ride that may leave you feeling more bewildered than entertained.',\n",

He's been caught and put back in Arkham so we're right back where we started, but then he gets killed... so why does this movie exist? And why does the first one exist? There is now no point.I have no problem with killing off of Main character, but it seems like this movie exists just to ruin the first one. How about you do this exact plot cut out 70% of the singing. Joker escapes trial about an hour into the movie. Leads his followers that are waiting and goes out in some sort of hail of gunfire.

Either in the asylum or in court. Back and forth from one boring scene to another. I have AMC stubs and pay monthly to see 3 movies a week and I find that because I'm not paying per movie, I'll see a lot more movies that I wouldnt see otherwise and can appreciate all sorts of films, but we couldn't appreciate this one at all and that RARELY happens for us.We were both very excited for the sequel, but this was a major disappointment. Even after hearing it was a musical we were excited because we love them! This was different though. We couldn't wait for each song to be over so we could see more of the story.

       "    'Review': 'Despite all the painful-to-watch and cringeworthy singing moments, I believe what makes this film a complete disaster is Todd Phillips\\'s failure to recognize that the Joker from the Batman series is not the character he wanted to portray. He aimed to create a film about a broken man finding his place in the world. While in the first film, many of us, at least myself, saw it as a \"set-up\" prologue, in this second installment, it is evident that it wasn\\'t. The character he wanted to flesh out has nothing to do with the Joker from Batman. I would even argue that he played us all for fools, taking advantage of the huge following of the series to obtain the resources he desired.However, this accusation is irrelevant, because what is truly aggravating is the fact that the Joker is supposed to be a kingpin-an insane mastermind who knows how to bend people to his will, even Batman. His insanity is not what makes him scary; it\\'s how his genius conceals it, making the most unsound arguments seem reasonable. This is something that Nolan and Heath Ledger truly understood at its core.I don\\'t care if Todd Phillips wanted to do something different; he should have done it under a different name and not within Batman\\'s universe. In my view, it is terribly disrespectful to those who were expecting a worthy origin story. He knew what he was doing; he wanted to tell the story of a victim-with zero eloquence, zero ambition, zero intelligence, and a dull persona. In Batman, he is anything but. That\\'s why people are upset: \"you get what you deserve\" when you strip a character beyond recognition. Justice has been served by the audience, and honestly, I couldn\\'t be happier for this to become a cautionary tale for anyone who wants to ignore the fact that Batman and the Joker became popular in the first place not because there weren\\'t enough stories around.',\n",

In the first movie, we got to see a complex, disturbed man slowly turn into a psychopathic villain with an incredible story. But in this sequel, he's turned into a fool who does everything for a woman who's completely pointless. Her character has no depth, no personality, and to top it off, everything about her turns out to be a lie. It's ridiculous.On top of that, the random songs thrown into serious moments are completely ridiculous. They totally break the mood and make it impossible to take the film seriously. It feels more like a bad joke than a continuation of the deep, dark world built in the first movie.The Joker, a character who was once so interesting and layered, is given a cheap, boring storyline that doesn't do him justice at all. The ending feels basic and disappointing, especially for such a complex character. Honestly, it's better to just pretend this sequel never existed and stick to the first movie, which was far superior in every way.Todd Phillips should make a public apology to Joaquin Phoenix, to the entire audience, and to the first movie for ruining one of the best characters and one of the greatest stories ever created in cinema.As a fan, my heart is broken. The first Joker was one of my favorite movies of all time, and now it feels like the creators didn't care about this sequel as much as we, the fans, did.

       "    'Review': 'This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Don\\'t waste your time on it, seriously. I repeat, don\\'t waste your time. From the very beginning, this film has been a huge disappointment. The idea of turning the Joker into a musical sounds absurd, and on screen, it looks even worse than you can imagine. Every time a song started, I just thought, \"Not again!\" - another three minutes of boredom and absolute nonsense. Numerous songs not only failed to contribute to the plot but also unnecessarily diluted and slowed it down. This format in no way suits the complex character of the Joker, who in the original film embodied chaos and mental instability. The songs and dances completely destroyed everything this character represents, turning the viewing experience into a real chore.As for the story, every moment that promised a twist or tension ended in yet another disappointment. For example, the courtroom scene when the Joker gets his closing statement. You expect a dramatic turn, but he admits that it was all a figment of his imagination and that the Joker doesn\\'t actually exist. Just when you think the jury might acquit him out of pity, they declare him guilty instead. The courtroom explodes, he escapes, finds himself with Lady Gaga, but instead of the film gaining momentum, they break up because he admits he\\'s no longer the Joker. Suddenly, he returns to prison, and in the end, he\\'s killed by an ordinary inmate. The ending is a complete anticlimax, leaving you confused.The acting is nowhere near the level of the first film. Although Joaquin Phoenix brilliantly brought the Joker to life in the original, here his performance remains overshadowed by the nonsensical musical elements and the absence of any tension, preventing his talent from shining through.Another absurd moment is the change in voice during the Joker\\'s closing statement. Suddenly, the voice is no longer Joaquin Phoenix\\'s but sounds like a completely different person. This is just one of many clumsy and nonsensical moments in the film.The story has no logic, the characters are disconnected, and character development is entirely absent. The script is weak, inconsistent, and feels like a desecration of everything the Joker represented in the original. I truly don\\'t understand how such a film received the green light, and even less how Joaquin Phoenix agreed to be part of such a misfire.Total disaster.',\n",

This sequel feels more like an exercise in empty style than a meaningful continuation of the iconic villain\\'s story.From the beginning, the pace is tedious and scenes drag on unnecessarily, making one wonder if there is actually a purpose behind each dialogue and scene. The plot, which attempts to be deep and provocative, gets lost in its own pretension, leaving the viewer with the feeling of having seen more of the same, but without the emotional impact that one would expect.The actors, who in theory could have contributed something interesting, seem unmotivated and their performances are flat, lacking the spark that made the first film shine. The chemistry between the characters is non-existent, making the interactions feel forced and unbelievable. Not even Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance, which had been previously acclaimed, manages to save this work from mediocrity. His acting, rather than being captivating, feels repetitive and lacking energy.In short, \"Joker 2\" is a failed attempt to recapture the magic of its predecessor.',\n",

       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is a direct sequel to the first film, aiming to recapture the unique atmosphere that made its predecessor so successful. The story continues to follow Arthur Fleck, now fully immersed in his Joker persona, as he navigates deeper psychological challenges and relationships, particularly with Harley Quinn. However, while the first film masterfully balanced psychological drama, suspense, and societal critique, this sequel feels somewhat more indulgent in style and lacks the same raw emotional impact.One of the standout aspects of the film is its visual and musical elements. The cinematography is striking, and the soundtrack once again plays a key role in setting the eerie, unsettling tone. The performances, especially from Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, are committed and intense, elevating the film\\'s character-driven moments. However, the storyline at times meanders and leans into more theatrical territory, making it feel less grounded and more abstract than the original.While the actors deliver impressive performances, the development of Arthur and Harley\\'s relationship feels rushed in parts, and the film doesn\\'t delve as deeply into their psychological complexities as it could. The addition of musical numbers, while bold, might not sit well with everyone and at times disrupts the film\\'s dark, gritty atmosphere.',\n",

When these seem to arrive, in reality they remain half-finished or only sadden. In the end there will be no exciting twist and the story doesn't mesh or convince at all.Lady Gaga's character is useless and unclear personally, like so many other things in the film.The only very positive note and I underline the only one: another masterful performance by the great Joaquin Phoenix who deserves a second Oscar.\",\n",

Did they do it because Gaga was there? She was great in A Star is Born, but here she looks lost. She could have acted better without singing. All along the film she is Lady Gaga, not Harley Quinn.Come on, Phoenix won an Academy Award as Joker, how come he agreed to this film and script?

There is absolutely nothing DC about this film apart from Location and Character names.

There is absolutely nothing in this film, it's a vacuous, empty and meaningless waste of time. The first film was a tragic masterpiece that was in a strange sort of way actually quite moving. You could at least feel a grain of sympathy for someone who had been abused all his life and finally cracked in a burst of insane violence. But this film lacked any kind of storyline and the Lady Gaga character was not even explained properly, she just appeared out of nowhere, a complete nonentity with no purpose. The Joker himself appeared resigned, sullen and uninteresting - completely different from the original film. The ending and the Joker's fate was not surprising, but again, it was sudden and unexplained, no real motive behind it.

If like me you loved the first Joker (I put it in my top 10 movies ever) then do not like me be tempted to see this movie because you think you have to! It is a musical! Yes you heard me right its a musical on the lines of La La land, I can only assume Lady Gaga's singing career has taken a nosedive and she needed to get as many songs as possible in this movie to show everyone she can still sing. And boy was there a lot of songs, why say it when you can sing it. Just like La La land. So if you do not want to spoil the first movie then do not watch this one, I unfortunately cannot erase the memory of this terrible film so will be unable to watch Joker again for a very long time.\",\n",

The writing in this movie is bad. Everything about this movie is bad. It's a complete waste of your time and money. People walked out of the movie theater during this movie.

       "    'Review': \"The new Joker movie is not just a disappointment-it's an outright insult to one of the most iconic characters in the Batman universe. To take the Joker, the fattest, most vibrant, and ingenious villain, and reduce him to this level of pathetic caricature is beyond comprehension. It's almost as if the creators deliberately set out to tarnish everything that made the Joker a brilliant force of chaos.Whoever thought this version of the Joker was a good idea should seriously reconsider their career choices. Honestly, the people behind this travesty deserve to be held accountable-maybe even jailed-for defaming such a legendary character. This film should be considered criminal for how it twists and mutilates the very essence of what makes the Joker the best of all Batman antagonists.In short, it's a slap in the face to true Batman fans. Save yourself the frustration and skip this one.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'This second installment of Joker, Folie à Deux, is not only an artistic betrayal but also an affront to the legacy of the iconic character that is the Joker. From the very first moments, it becomes clear that the film seeks to demystify and disarm what makes the Clown Prince of Crime so great and terrifying. The Joker, in his original form, is the embodiment of pure chaos, a being whose complete lack of remorse and conscience is his strength and allure. Yet, this film makes the tragic mistake of over-humanizing him.By showing him vulnerable, filled with doubts, remorse, and regrets, the film strips away what makes him so magnetic: his absolute refusal to conform to societal rules, his relentless nihilism. The audience is faced with a broken man, sick, tormented by his identity, which not only breaks with what the character represents but is also deeply disappointing for those expecting to see the Joker we know and fear.This approach, far from adding depth, actually dilutes the complexity of the Joker. Where pure and unpredictable madness once reigned, we are now subjected to clumsy introspection that betrays not only the character\\'s DNA but also the essence of what made the first installment so successful. The Joker is not a man to be understood or excused; he is a force of disorder, the very personification of chaos.In the end, this film feels more like a disjointed psychological exploration, a spin-off that might have been interesting for another character but certainly not for the Joker. In trying to make him more \"human,\" the film removes everything that makes him unique and terrifying. A weakened, lost Joker, unable to recognize himself in his own actions, is a true insult to the legacy of this iconic character.',\n",

       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie À Deux\" is an exhausting misstep that betrays the bold spirit of its predecessor. Where the first \"Joker\" was an incisive psychological thriller, this sequel is an overstuffed, self-indulgent mess, trading subtlety for spectacle and losing sight of what made the original so compelling. The film stumbles under the weight of its own pretensions, trying desperately to be provocative but only succeeding in being hollow.The decision to make this a musical feels more like a gimmick than a thoughtful creative choice. The music sequences are jarring, out of place, and do nothing to further the narrative. Instead of enhancing the emotional landscape, they disrupt it, turning moments of potential tension into unintentionally laughable scenes. It\\'s as if the filmmakers are screaming for attention, hoping to distract the audience from the film\\'s lack of substance with over-the-top set pieces and dizzying visuals.Joaquin Phoenix, who gave a haunting, layered performance in the original, seems to be on autopilot here. His portrayal of Arthur Fleck feels more like a parody than a continuation of the character\\'s descent into madness. The film\\'s attempts to explore his psyche again are shallow, rehashing the same themes without offering any new insights. The character\\'s arc stagnates, and by the end, we\\'re left wondering if there was any real purpose to his journey this time around.Lady Gaga\\'s Harley Quinn feels equally misused. Her talent is undeniable, but the script gives her little to work with. Her character comes off as a caricature, lacking the complexity or tragic depth needed to balance Arthur\\'s madness. Instead, the film leans too heavily on their chemistry, hoping it will be enough to carry the story, but it never really gels.Visually, the film is as chaotic as its narrative. Todd Phillips seems more interested in crafting striking imagery than in telling a coherent story. The cinematography, while impressive in its ambition, often feels like style over substance. The film\\'s color palette and set design, though aesthetically bold, can\\'t hide the emptiness at its core.In trying to be a provocative commentary on society\\'s ills, \"Folie À Deux\" feels more like a desperate plea for attention, a shallow imitation of the first film\\'s more profound moments. It\\'s a sequel that misunderstands its own success, turning what was once a powerful character study into an incoherent spectacle. Rather than leaving the theater feeling unsettled or reflective, audiences are likely to walk away feeling bewildered and, worst of all, indifferent.Ultimately, \"Joker: Folie À Deux\" is a muddled and overwrought sequel that squanders the potential of its predecessor. It aims for high art but crashes under the weight of its own ambitions, delivering a film that is neither thought-provoking nor entertaining.',\n",

The amount of unnecessary songs and singing just made this movie drag and I caught myself clock watching, which is a first for me!!! Gaga totally ruined it for me.A real lack of attention went into continuity of the previous movie in relation to characters and relationships, felt disjointed.Joaquim undeniably was incredible and deserved all 4 stars I have rated this.A LONG movie with too much sing song, SO much potential but they really missed the mark with this one.And the ending.....a pathetic tribute to an incredible character.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Last night, I went to watch Joker 2 with high hopes. As a fan of the original Joker, I was excited to see what the sequel had in store. I remember the first movie being filled with tension, suspense, and a deeply captivating storyline, so I expected the same kind of intensity and thrill from the second installment. However, my experience this time was far from what I anticipated.The first red flag was the cinema itself. When I entered the theater, I noticed that there were only about 10 people seated, which was surprising and disappointing, especially for a film that's part of such a popular franchise. For a movie that should have drawn large crowds, seeing such a small turnout made me wonder if others already knew something I didn't. Usually, when I attend a big film release, the energy in the cinema is palpable, with hundreds of people buzzing with anticipation. But this time, the atmosphere felt flat, and the lack of audience interaction contributed to the overall underwhelming experience.As the movie started, I tried to set aside my worries and focus on the film, hoping it would make up for the poor turnout. But unfortunately, it didn't take long for my disappointment to deepen. From the very beginning, Joker 2 felt directionless. The storyline lacked any real depth or purpose, and it seemed like the filmmakers were struggling to recapture the essence of what made the first Joker so compelling. In the original movie, we were taken on a powerful emotional journey, watching Arthur Fleck's descent into madness and seeing the birth of one of the most iconic villains in comic book history. It was gripping, shocking, and thought-provoking. In contrast, the sequel seemed to meander without any clear objective or focus.One of the biggest issues with Joker 2 was the absence of a coherent storyline. There was no strong narrative thread that tied the events of the movie together, and it felt like the writers were throwing random scenes together without considering how they contributed to the overall plot. The character development was weak, and I found it hard to connect with or care about any of the characters, including Arthur himself. In the first film, Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the Joker was nothing short of mesmerizing. His performance was raw, intense, and emotionally charged. However, in Joker 2, it felt like his character had lost that spark. Instead of feeling like we were watching a complex and multi-dimensional character, Arthur came across as flat and uninteresting.Another major disappointment was the lack of action or suspense. For a movie that's supposed to be thrilling, Joker 2 felt remarkably dull. There were no edge-of-your-seat moments, no heart-pounding action sequences, and no twists or surprises that kept me engaged. The pacing was slow, and at times, I found myself losing interest entirely. I kept waiting for something big to happen, but it never did. The tension that was so masterfully built in the first movie was completely absent here.To make matters worse, the cinematography and direction also failed to impress. In the first Joker, the dark and gritty visuals perfectly complemented the mood and tone of the film. However, in Joker 2, the visuals felt uninspired, and there was nothing memorable or striking about the way the movie was shot. It lacked the artistic flair that made the original stand out.In the end, I walked out of the cinema feeling like I had wasted my time. Joker 2 was a disappointment on almost every level. The lack of a compelling storyline, weak character development, absence of action, and overall dullness made it a movie that I can't recommend. For fans of the original, this sequel will likely feel like a letdown. While I had hoped for a thrilling, thought-provoking continuation of the Joker's story, what I got instead was a forgettable and lifeless film. Unfortunately, Joker 2 is not worth the time or money.\",\n",

The songs don't fit at all, they just mess with the flow and kill the tension. What made Joker good was the raw, real feel of it, and now it's like they're tryna make it quirky or something.Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn doesn't even save it. Her scenes feel awkward, and the whole musical vibe just makes the movie drag. If you wanted a deep dive into Arthur's mind, this ain't it. They lost what made the first one dope.You ruined it, congrats.\",\n",

The film had no direction and objective just back and forth between two scenes of the prison and court house and we didn't see the crazy killing joker that we all craved all we got was a man that said he's not up for the job of being called the joker. It focused way too much on Harley I don't know if the directors were horny because it was Lady Gava or whatever her name is but her role was totally unnecessary and just because in real life she's a signer doesn't mean we need 30% of the movie to be signing! There's only one thing they could have done to make this film better and that's not release it at all.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"This is a sequel to another movies so there's a reasonable expectation that this movie should feel as if it were a part of the original but it doesn't and one of the major reasons why is simply the singing. Some of the reviews here try to play this down saying there isn't much but it's literally all the time. Someone probably owed Lady Gaga a favor and told her they would put her in a movie and make the movie a musical and, unfortunately for us, this was the movie that Lady Gaga got cast in and ruined our sequel.This movie has no story, there are no twists and turns, nothing to make you think. There's no action either. This isn't some deep dive into Arthur's mind either like some people suggest. This isn't some psychological drama or thriller. This movie is a rudderless boat going nowhere.I stand by this movie being made for Lady Gaga to be in a movie with singing -- that's all this is.\",\n",

I also feel that there was supposed to be a huge social movement of people wanting to be The Joker but it was literally just two guys. I feel like this movie could have scrapped Lady Gaga altogether to save some money and even re-cast The Joker as anyone else and the movie would maybe have turned a profit.

Rather than delivering a cohesive, engaging story, the movie feels like a vehicle for the director's personal vendetta. The plot meanders, prioritizing shallow shock value over meaningful character development and storytelling. It's as if the filmmaker took the iconic Joker character and used him as a mouthpiece for his own disillusioned worldview, sacrificing the integrity of the source material in the process. This self-indulgent approach results in a disjointed, emotionally hollow experience that fails to resonate with viewers. Instead of a thought-provoking exploration of the Joker's complexities, we're left with a shallow, artsy exercise in nihilism.\",\n",

Any time the movie begins to have a good scene with decent dialogue, the characters suddenly break out into song. This is done repeatedly over and over and it just stops any momentum the movie gets.

It's not telling a story, or an interesting one at least. While you know that there is growth on Joaquin's character, it doesn't makes sense, there is no real development, and as most elements in the movie it feels forced.-Length. The movie is unnecessarily long - there are no interesting dialogs, nothing that justifies its. To me, this boils down to poor editing. A sequence of a character walking to a jury stand takes over a minute, with no reason of being there, no purpose at all. What a waste of talents and resources.-The music. I knew it was a musical, and I actually enjoy them. Also, I used to like Lady Gaga's singing. But singing is so forced. Whenever the movie gives a glimpse of coherence, your ears start getting abused by the unnecessary, odd singing. Just because you have a singer in the cast, doesn't mean that you have to make her sing every time she comes into the screen. It felt like a hook or promo for LG, or a long music video that no one ask to see.Overall I feel bad for all of the people that work hard into making such a movie, the actors, extras, production, even investors - they are all doing their best. But not even Joaquin Phoenix can save such a mess of a movie.\",\n",

Joker: Folie à Deux is a pretentious mess that takes everything compelling about Arthur Fleck\\'s tragic descent into madness and reduces it to a meaningless, self-indulgent circus-literally.Turning the film into a musical was already a red flag, but I held onto hope that it could work... until I realized the musical numbers were neither entertaining nor served any narrative purpose. They don\\'t move the plot forward like in Grease or flesh out the characters like in Chicago. Instead, they\\'re just there, awkwardly shoehorned in to give the movie an air of \"artistic depth\" that it doesn\\'t earn. Lady Gaga does her best with what she\\'s given, but her Harley Quinn feels more like an opportunist than the Joker\\'s right-hand. She manipulates him, uses him, and eventually discards him-making her feel like a completely different character from the devoted, chaotic Harley we know and love. It\\'s almost as if the writers decided to \"fix\" Harley Quinn by stripping away everything that made her interesting.But the real slap in the face comes at the end: the big reveal that Arthur Fleck wasn\\'t even the Joker. That twist is not only lazy, it\\'s insulting. The entire point of the first movie was watching a man slowly transform into the Clown Prince of Crime. By ripping that away, Folie à Deux retroactively cheapens the original Joker-undermining its impact and making the audience feel like they wasted their time. Why should we care about Arthur\\'s story if, in the end, he\\'s just another wannabe Joker?If you loved the first movie, do yourself a favor and pretend this sequel doesn\\'t exist. Joker: Folie à Deux takes a beautifully crafted character study and turns it into a pointless, soulless spectacle that doesn\\'t deserve to be part of the Joker mythos. Save yourself the heartbreak.',\n",

I was expecting that the next joker can be like the Batman cartoons with all the bad guys but first the number one Batman enemy \"the joker\"!!!! Or the Dark knight with Christian Bale... What a waste of time of movie, why a musical? Is that popular now? No one wants to watch a villian from dc comics in a musical. I don\\'t see Marvel doing a Musical. DC DIrector please keep the DC comics in the path. As a DC and Marvel fan this joker movie is Horrible.....Next time they should hire Christopher Nolan.Bye.',\n",

That hack and its writers have literally destroyed Joker at a molecular level.This trifle of a \"film\" it is an insult to comic book fans, musicals. More than enraged I am insulted at the level of disregard to one of the greatest characters ever created.The fault falls on Todd Phillips, Warner rothers and DC, they should never be allowed to make another film in their entire miserable lifespan.I came into the movie wanting it to prove everyone wrong, to give me a sense of awe and marvel, instead I came out hating cinema at its very foundation, no movie in my entire life has made me feel this way.Every copy of this film should be burn, destroyed and buried, along with the career if Todd Phillips, who does not deserve the privileges bestowed upon him.Loving cinema sometimes means loathing it. I have seen more than my fair share of horse crap movies. But Joker: Folie à Deux is without the shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie I ever seen in my entire life.',\n",

I have personally sworn off all future Hollywood releases in lieu of recent torment-fests including the quasi-fantasy, anti-thriller, political-parody CIVIL WAR, which subsequently ruined the reputation of another previously lauded filmmaker in the process.Truly abysmal.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"I went into Joker 2024 with high expectations, especially after the success of the 2019 film. Unfortunately, this sequel was a complete letdown. The plot felt disjointed and lacked the depth that made the first Joker so impactful. Rather than expanding on Arthur Fleck's psychological journey, it seemed like the film was trying too hard to capitalize on the original's success without adding anything meaningful.The addition of Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn was unnecessary and felt forced. Her character didn't add any value to the story, and her portrayal came across as more of a distraction than an asset. It almost felt like a stunt casting decision rather than a thoughtful addition to the narrative. Instead of delving deeper into the twisted dynamics of Joker's mind, the film shifted its focus to musical numbers and melodrama, which diluted the dark and gritty atmosphere that fans were hoping for.Visually, the film tried to replicate the aesthetic of its predecessor, but even that fell flat. The cinematography lacked the raw intensity that made the original Joker stand out, and the pacing dragged, making the film feel much longer than it needed to be.In the end, Joker 2024 feels like a missed opportunity. Instead of exploring new and complex ideas, it rehashes old themes with less impact. It's a pale imitation of the original, and sadly, it just didn't live up to the hype.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'This is what happens when you have a producer/team that actively hates the movie or show they\\'re supposed to make. Calling this a movie is an insult to other movies.Now I know that some people have a problem with it being a musical, which I\\'m personally not a fan of, but that\\'s somehow the least bad thing about this thing. It\\'s not a decision many people would have made, but it definitely could have worked if this were a stand alone movie, instead of sequel, which it barely is.The problem is more with the message & what they\\'ve done with the main character, which they clearly despise. Why make a movie you don\\'t wanna make, about a character that you hate? Who knows. I\\'d say they did it for a quick paycheck, but that\\'s not gonna happen with this monstrocity.Todd Phillips has admitted that comic movies aren\\'t real movies to him, which is an opinion he\\'s allowed to have, but then why make a comic movie then? And when it turns out to be a success (1st Joker movie) & you still hate it, why would you instead of doing the same thing again, sabotage the movie on purpose just because you personally don\\'t like it?If you don\\'t like the work you\\'re doing but you need the paycheck, there\\'s 2 options. You either do the work for the money or you find a different job that you actually want to do. He picked another option, do the job very poorly so you don\\'t get anything out of it. Not exactly a smart move.Now for the actual message of the movie, it\\'s very clear what they were trying to tell the audience, because of how subtle it was, like a hammer to the face. \"you need to stay in line & do as you\\'re told or there will be consequences. How dare you have hope or agency or stand up for yourself, you must be punished\" a message so despicable it made the audience & the critics agree with each other, which rarely happens, but miracles do exist, they just come in the most unexpected ways.As someone who liked the 1st movie, I\\'ll pretend like this thing doesn\\'t exist. How they managed to build up a character, just to break him down constantly in this is just sad. They really wanted to make us dislike this movie & they\\'ve succeeded.',\n",

The plot was hard to follow, with a weak storyline that seemed to go nowhere. The movie didn't give us much to hold on to, and I found myself wondering what exactly we were supposed to see or understand. It was confusing and felt like the narrative was scattered without a clear direction....One of the most disappointing aspects was the casting. Specifically, Lady Gaga's role was completely miscast. Her performance lacked depth, and it seemed as though she was out of place. She didn't bring the complexity that was needed for the character, and I honestly believe Hollywood should reconsider casting her in major roles like this. It's frustrating to see such a weak portrayal in a film that could have had potential. Overall, the movie felt like a missed opportunity, and I wouldn't recommend it.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux was a disappointing and misguided sequel that failed to capture the magic of the original. While the first film delved deep into the psyche of a troubled individual, painting a haunting portrait of mental illness and societal decay, the sequel felt more like a shallow imitation.The decision to incorporate a musical element was a misstep that detracted from the film's dark and gritty tone. While the musical numbers were technically well-executed, they felt out of place and disrupted the narrative flow. The juxtaposition of upbeat songs with the film's heavy subject matter created a jarring dissonance that left the audience feeling confused and disconnected.Joaquin Phoenix delivered another strong performance as the titular character, but even his talent couldn't salvage a film that was fundamentally flawed. Lady Gaga's casting was intriguing, but her character felt underdeveloped and her singing, while impressive, didn't quite fit the world of the film.The story itself was predictable and lacked the depth and complexity of the original. The film's exploration of mental illness felt superficial, and the ending was unsatisfying and left many questions unanswered.In conclusion, Joker: Folie à Deux is a missed opportunity. It squandered the potential of the franchise and failed to live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. Fans of the first film will likely be disappointed by this sequel, which feels more like a cash grab than a genuine attempt to continue the story.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'This sequel is a complete disappointment and it feels like the director and writers wanted to back-track what the first movie was all about.They disintegrated Arthur\\'s character and I can\\'t fathom why they chose this direction except for that they wanted to portray the Joker and all of his followers as \"crazy people without any reason\". To try and dehumanize criminals and people with mental illnesses that they \"do crazy things because they are crazy\" and not that they act according to their surroundings and experiences.One wouldn\\'t expect a sequel to the first film, but if there were a sequel the logical way would be that Arthur continues to find himself in his alter ego the Joker. Because in the first film he was always abused and shunned, you felt pity for him and when he snapped there was an understanding to WHY he acted like he did, even though you don\\'t necessarily agree with the violence he acted out, you understood why he took that direction and found yourself rooting for him. The people that were in power always abused their power and never tried to understand how everyone below them had it, and the people who had suffered never had a place in society because they were different, these people suddenly had someone that dared to stand up for themselves and take place. They wanted to join Joker in overthrowing Gotham, because they saw all the ugly in it that was created by the ones in power and thus wanted to revolt.The Joker was finally seen in a society that always had neglected him and his followers felt the same way.It feels like the directors now don\\'t want us to sympathize with Jokers followers, maybe because it would be dangerous/problematic to hint at (or inspire) a violent revolution from the neglected people in the society.The plot in this movie is so conflicting and weird and it never really got us anywhere except to discredit the first film.If we look past the terrible plot and story, the film also feels grossly long and there is no reason to why it\\'s a musical, it feels forced. There are only 2 songs that actually make sense, and they also feel long.The acting is of course great, but even that can\\'t save this movie to receive anything higher than 1 star. I created an account just to write this review because of how disappointed I am and I could go on and on about all the conflicting plot.Anyone supporting this movie never understood what the first movie was about. Joker isn\\'t a separate identity to Arthur, The Joker is Arthur without inhibitions, The Joker is Arthur\\'s true self that has evolved through a lifetime of abuse and neglect from the ones closest to him and his society. The followers love Joker because of what he stands for and because he is his unapologetic himself.',\n",

Yea, sure, no possible way that you just happen to enjoy a terrible film right? The movie is pretentious, the plot is paper thin, and yes, there is way too much singing. It\\'s hard to put into words how badly I dislike this movie.Joker 2 is actually a perfect Joker movie in a way because it is in fact a complete joke. As many have stated, this movie was dead the moment they decided to make it a musical. Those who like musicals in general is already a very small audience. Those who like musicals and enjoyed the first Joker has to be such a tiny number it makes you wonder what the execs who greenlit this sequel were thinking because it was a truly awful film to sit through.There is a reason virtually all live action versions of Harley Quinn have felt so bad in recent years, and it\\'s because Hollywood is too scared to write her as she\\'s supposed to be. The real Harley is supposed to be obsessed, infatuated, and completely crazy about Joker. For obvious reasons, Hollywood will not put this on screen because they\\'re terrified of being called s*xist. Harley just has to be a stronk woman now and that\\'s just never going to work because that\\'s not what she is as a character.

This is the worst sequel ever made.If you are a fan of that first joker movie and if you're a comic book fan in general... this movie hates you, and everyone that supported the first joker. This is a middle finger to an entire fanbase in cinematic form. Everyone that agreed to do this movie, including Lady Gaga, Joaquin Phoenix, Todd Phillips, and all of the returning cast and crew should be ashamed of themselves.I'm not gonna spoil the movie, but I have to be honest with you... Don't see this. Hes not even the Joker throughout most of the film, unless it some of the musical numbers OH YEAH BY THE WAY, this is a musical now. Also, the ending doesn't make any sense and it basically ruins not only this entire movie but the first movie as well. They're basically is no story by the way. Without the musical numbers, this movie would be 45 minutes long and to be honest with you with the way the story goes. There's no reason for this movie to exist. Literally zero. Also, they completely change Harley Quinn's character, And even the same character anymore in fact, they don't even call her Harley. Might as well have not even use her in this movie and just called her a completely different person and it would've been exactly the same same. Arthur Fleck also doesn't act at all like how he did at the end of the first movie and it kind of retracts back to how he was at the beginning which doesn't make sense because the whole point of that first movie is that he evolved into the joker. There's a ton of holes in this movie and people show back up and things happen in this that don't match up at all with the first movie. And I understand that they keep using the excuse that he imagines and always hallucinates things, but that can only go so far. This movie literally seemed like Todd Phillips made a fake script and sent it to the studio because he didn't want to do a sequel but the studio couldn't figure that out and they made him make the movie anyway and now he's being forced to make a fake script for a movie that he didn't wanna make. That's honestly how it feels. It really does feel like at the end though that this movie was an intentional , stab in the back to all the people that were fans with that first movie. Because it's so cynical towards not just the people that follow the joker and who the joker is, but also that a fan of the comics in general and also other adaptations of those comics. There's one Instance, especially towards the end, that is not only extremely confusing, but it's also just really disrespectful and insulting in general that makes it seem like the person who made this movie was genuinely trying to piss people off.So yeah... I think it goes without saying at this point I did not like this movie. But I have to be honest with you. I have never hated a film more in my entire life. This movie has wasted my time, and my money, and Many many many months of not only being excited for this movie but also for the first movie as well and which this movie destroys coinciding. If you like the first joker, please do not watch this. This is without a doubt, my least favorite movie of all time.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I was determined to be open-minded and optimistic about a Joker musical, especially with a pair of lungs like Lady Gaga involved, but I'm sorry to say that Joker Folie å Deux is a misfire of epic proportions, fully deserving of the hatred it has been receiving. I'm not averse to musicals in general, only when the singing is terrible, and Joaquin Phoenix couldn't carry a tune in a basket - Gaga can only do so much, and even she is given little opportunity to shine, only occasionally belting out the tunes like we know she can.Add the fact that the plot is stupefyingly dull - part dreary prison story, part boring courtroom drama - and what you have is the sequel that no-one wanted. The themes are the same as the first film - madness, mental illness, societal collapse etc. - but the execution is so left-field as to alienate the established fan base. It's an undeniably gutsy move to make something so completely different, but there's something to be said for the old adage 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' - especially when your leading man is so musically challenged.1/10 - quite possibly the worst film of the year.N. B. The projectionist seemed unable to get the picture in focus at the screening I saw, but I couldn't be bothered to get up and say something. If the film had been better it might have been worth the effort.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"To me this is worst than the room in all the bad ways.i don't know how this man got an Oscar. Why was it even put in theatres. Big stain on everyone involved careers .To call it a film would be generous-it's more of a disjointed, pretentious mess disguised as something profound. The pacing is unbearable, like it's trying so hard to stretch its shallow material over a bloated runtime, all while pretending it has something deep to say. The script is an incoherent mix of clichés and empty provocations, with dialogue that sounds like it was written by someone who just discovered edgy internet forums.Joaquin Phoenix's performance, while praised by many, felt like nothing more than a series of exaggerated facial contortions and tics without any real depth behind them. It was more about spectacle than substance, and it's baffling that this one-dimensional portrayal was awarded with an Oscar. The film's attempt at psychological exploration is laughably superficial, and its forced edginess comes off as desperate.As for the direction, it feels like Todd Phillips was trying to mimic better filmmakers but missed the mark entirely. The tone is all over the place, and the cinematography, which some have praised, feels more like a cheap imitation of Scorsese's style. The whole thing reeks of self-importance without any justification for it.It's a film that mistakes being grim and joyless for being meaningful. The fact that it made it to theaters, let alone received critical acclaim, says more about the current state of Hollywood than the actual quality of this movie. Every person involved should seriously reconsider their creative choices.\",\n",

Instead, we have the beaten down, broken Arthur, who gets hammered down even lower as the film progresses. And why is lady ga-ga here? Seriously?! Did someone decide that the first film's premise was far to close to the hearts of modern audiences and then panicked and insisted a strong independent female come in and join in on stomping the life out of the joker? It would appear so! And why make this a musical? How does that in anyway shape or form link up to the first film?What a wasted opportunity. Hollywood just keeps swinging and missing!People liked the joker because it was about a guy standing up for himself. Arthur becoming the Joker was seen as what can happen when someone snaps, something most people can relate to, it's a dark fantasy. In this, the second film, it's as if Arthur/joker is just being punished over and over again, to the point where the joker no longer exists and Arthur is more broken than before. Is this some kind of message to the downtrodden? Know your place, go with the narrative, do as you're told or else?I really don't understand why they chose to go in such a direction with this film.\",\n",

Needs to take a hard look at their creative control over their hit movies, because this sequel is a straight-up embarrassment. It's like they took everything that made the original great and threw it out the window.I'm genuinely sad to see a beloved character and story fall so far from its former glory. This franchise deserved better, and the fans deserved more. The plot was a mess, the characters were paper-thin, and the dialogue was cringe-worthy. I'm still wondering how a film with so much potential could go so wrong. I hope the studio takes this as a wake-up call and goes back to the drawing board to figure out what made the original film so great in the first place.Right now, I'm just left feeling disappointed and frustrated. This sequel was a waste of potential, and it's a reminder that sometimes, it's better to leave well enough alone rather than trying to revive something that's best left in the past.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I'm really disappointed with this new direction for the 2024 Joker film. The original 'Joker' was a raw, dark exploration of mental illness and society's failings, with a tone that was unsettling and deeply impactful. It didn't rely on cheap tricks to make a point; it was grounded and gritty, which made Arthur Fleck's descent into madness feel real and haunting.So why turn the sequel into a musical? This feels like a complete disconnect from what made the first movie so powerful. Instead of continuing with the same intense atmosphere, we're bombarded with music at every turn, even in moments that should have been suspenseful or emotionally heavy. It almost feels like the filmmakers were more interested in crafting a musical experience than telling a compelling story.The constant musical interruptions destroy the tone of Gotham's chaotic underworld. It's frustrating because it feels like a decision to stand out rather than honor what made the original so memorable. A flashy musical? That's not what Joker fans signed up for. We wanted to see Arthur Fleck's journey continue, not break into song. If you don't have Spotify Premium, you can watch this movie.\",\n",

Not only does the musical aspect distract the viewer, it manages to irritate them as well. If, and i mean a big if, but if the musical portion was what the director used to add another dimension to the psychotic descent of the Joker into madness or the coping mechanisms of the Arthur Fleck to find his voice, why make that into a muscial which by the premise of the charaters insanity, will only serve to alienate the viewer. I almost walked out in the middle of it and, given what I saw throughout, I wished I had. Give us the real Joker 2, not this nonsense.',\n",

I feel sad and angry as if I watched the last season of Game of Thrones.The first movie of Joker was not great, yes, but the second series did not deserve it either. The nonsense called musical goes to love movies (in fact, it does not go to that either, this category should be deleted from the history of movies anyway) The constant singing of songs like Bollywood is annoying and disrupts concentration. Even if it was not a musical, the script is already terrible from top to bottom. I am not even talking about the ending. This disgraceful script is a complete insult to the audience next to such good acting. It is as if Todd Philips could not curse everyone and made such a movie.Oh Lady Gaga, what should we say about your choosing these movies with non-flowing scripts? A star is born, house of gucci and now this movie.. they were all boring. The only plus of a star is born was that you made great songs. Your best work was ahs hotel.

       "    'Review': \"*Joker: Folie à Deux* is a frustrating misstep, a sequel that fails to capture the magic of its predecessor while trying too hard to stand out. What worked so well in the original *Joker*-the gritty, grounded portrayal of Arthur Fleck's descent into madness-has been overshadowed here by the bizarre decision to turn the film into a musical. Yes, a *musical*. It's a tonal clash that feels forced, and instead of adding depth, the songs often disrupt the flow of the narrative and pull the viewer out of the dark, brooding world the first film built so carefully.Joaquin Phoenix, as talented as he is, seems to be retreading old ground. His performance feels less intense, almost phoned in, compared to the raw, unsettling portrayal of Arthur Fleck in the first film. Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn, while competent, lacks the charm and complexity the character demands. Instead of a layered and dangerous connection, their relationship comes off as shallow, more chaotic for the sake of chaos than driven by any real emotion or backstory.Visually, *Folie à Deux* tries too hard. The over-stylized musical numbers clash awkwardly with the film's dark, psychological themes, creating a disjointed experience. The blend of genres could have been intriguing, but the execution feels more like a gimmick than a thoughtful narrative device.In the end, the movie drags, bloated with unnecessary scenes and lacking the emotional weight that made the original so captivating. *Joker: Folie à Deux* is a messy, over-the-top spectacle that doesn't live up to its potential, leaving fans of the original disappointed and confused about why this sequel was even made.\",\n",

It's a deconstruction of the first film, with meta elements similar to the matrix 4, if you loved that movie then this is for you and you alone, for everyone else you will hate this film, it's trying so hard to stick a middle finger up at you as revenge for you not enjoying joker 1 the way todd wanted you to and for daring to have your own opinions and to think for yourself and see Arthur Fleck like Todd wanted you to, a sad and pathetic loser who was worth nothing and committed horrible atrocities (in his view) who deserved no sympathy, after the fact (once the movie released and was a massive success)The movie is a beautiful train wreck, it looks visually stunning and is well shot and the technical aspects are pretty much 10/10 but is made purely as an F U to all those who loved the first. It a musical with terrible original songs that are spectical only and don't make you feel anything, south park did it better 23 years ago. The story is paper thin and gave away the ending with the trailer, typical Hollywood.People say the ending is controversial but it's not really once you know how Todd felt after the success of the first. Todd makes sure it's painfully obvious he's giving you the complete opposite of what a fan would want from this movie and the ending is just the nails in the coffin.At many points the ending included you think you're going to finally get some satisfaction and get what you came to see but no, the film is just subverting expections the movie. The ending is absolutely horrendous and literally ra**es the predecessor, I would of honestly preferred Arthur hit his head and woke up from a dream to then have the credits roll.If you're a fan of the first avoid like the plague this is honestly one of the worst sequels ever made.I hope it bombs and Todd Phillips's reputation never recovers.He did a hangover 3 again, I hope he never makes another movie.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'If you enjoyed the first movie and appreciated what it represented, then you will likely find yourself disappointed with the sequel. One of the core issues stems from the claims that Arthur was never meant to be the Joker, something even the director has supposedly admitted. But if that\\'s the case, why name the movie \"Joker\" in the first place? Why craft a story around Arthur being a comedian, giving him a tic-like laugh and depicting him as someone descending into madness? It feels as though the director is attempting to pull the wool over the eyes of fans. As someone who loves comic books, with a vast collection of Batman and Joker graphic novels, this explanation-that Arthur was never the Joker-comes across as a weak and frankly absurd excuse to address the glaring problems with the sequel.The story itself feels unfocused, disjointed, and chaotic. The choices made by the director seem more in line with wanting to anger Warner Bros. Or frustrate the fans rather than build on the original film\\'s promise. What they did to Arthur in this sequel feels like a betrayal. It\\'s as though they took the easiest possible path and destroyed any possibility of Joaquin Phoenix returning as the Joker-or even of Arthur evolving as a character. In the first movie, there was at least a potential, an expectation, that Arthur could become a new version of the Joker set in an alternate universe. Some people argued that because Bruce Wayne was still a child, Arthur could never really be the Joker. But that\\'s a weak argument in a world where comic book characters span different universes and timelines. The possibility of creating a unique, alternate Joker with Arthur was completely discarded with this sequel.Then, there\\'s the portrayal of Harley Quinn-a character beloved by so many, with such rich history alongside the Joker. The filmmakers had endless opportunities with her, yet they chose to reduce her to just another fan-someone who added absolutely nothing to the movie. She wasn\\'t even an intense, obsessive \"Stan\"-type fan, just someone blandly thrown in to further diminish Arthur\\'s character, which already felt like it was being destroyed by the director, the writer, and everyone involved in this movie.In the end, watching this sequel felt like a gut punch. For those who cherished the first movie and the Arthur/Joker narrative, this was a massive disappointment. If I could, I would erase this movie from my memory entirely.',\n",

Cheap thrown together movie if I've ever seen one .. Gaga is a fav but this wasn't a flattering role for her in any way. Sequel's are already hard to pull off with these movies, but it feels very little thought was put into the making of this movie. The ending was pointless it felt like a whole two hours focused on a court room and music. They could have thrown in some childhood throwbacks or something worth while!\",\n",

You'll also get to see a few scenes but yeah every 5 minutes you'll listen to another song other than watching a movie. I didn't thought it would be this bad but man...

There was no plot, no point, completely dark and bleak! And to portray it as a fantasy musical was beyond bizarre! I found zero entertainment and redemption in it. I wonder why a film like this is made? Do producers, the director and actors actually believe in the product? If so, they're in a bubble and are delusional. If I could get my money back, I would. Surprised I sat through the whole thing, kept waiting for something to happen and it didn't. I wish I could recommend it but I can't. Seems that most reviews on the IMDB board agree. Joker has a well-deserved low score. Sorry.\",\n",

I'm not a superfan, I can't talk for hours about any iteration of The Joker, however I watched the first one when it came out and enjoyed it. I'm saying this because there's a solid chance that certain aspects completely went over my head and maybe someone who knows a lot about this world can find something in this movie that I haven'tThis movie was flat out boring. I don't need constant action to entertain me, but this movie had virtually nothing. It was just a man in jail, a man in a courtroom, and a man on the streets. All that it really did was tell us about the first movie, which constantly reminded me of how much better it was.When the credits rolled, I felt as if genuinely not a single second of that movie was enjoyable in the slightest and that I had completely and totally wasted my time. In fact, I'd argue that the ending is insulting to anyone who even moderately liked the first one simply because this whole movie accomplished absolutely nothing!I can not overstate how much nothing is going on here. There is nothing of substance in the entire movie. I 110% suggest skipping out on this one.\",\n",

Halfway through the movie I'm checking my phone to see how much time was left in the movie because it's so boring and lacking any real storyline. About the last 20-30 minutes their were people literally getting up and walking out of the movie because of how boring it was. There were too many musical scenes crammed into the movie and not enough story. The most exciting part about this movie was the movie trailer. Even that is misleading because anything that even looked remotely exciting was actually apart of some kind of musical/day dream sequence in the Jokers head so it technically never really happened. Definitely, skip this movie. Anyone who praises this movie and gives it 10 stars saying it's some kind of masterpiece that looks into the human psyche... those are the kind of people who don't know and do not respect the original Batman lore. Those are the kind of fake people that watch this kind of disaster of a movie then pat themselves on the back and tell themselves they are some kind of worldly intellectual. 🙄\",\n",

The whole point of Harley is to show the impact of the joker n how he changed her, this was basically skipped.The musical aspect was sickening to the point I left after 1 hour and 15mins because I just couldn't watch it anymore.We've all been made aware of directors straying from source material e.g. Henry cavill with the Witcher series, halo etc.. Here we are again.I understand that the musical aspect worked from the first movie but having the characters in a dark story singing is just bizarre and completely different from having an iconic character dancing to a fitting soundtrack. It felt like the movie and story was adjusted to accommodate GaGa, like she'd had a musical clause in her contract.Overall I've never been so disappointed. To have such potential and destroy it like that was sickening. Surely seeing the Batman and penguin success, the blueprint was there and ignored.If I could get a refund I would.

       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is a frustratingly disappointing sequel that fails to capture the intensity and psychological depth of the original. What should have been a gripping exploration of Arthur Fleck\\'s further descent into madness instead becomes a muddled, aimless story bogged down by an ill-fitting musical element. The chemistry between Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga feels forced, and the film\\'s attempts at surrealism come off as pretentious rather than meaningful. Visually striking but emotionally hollow, it leans too heavily on style without substance. A major letdown for fans of the original.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"I went into this film with high expectations, having loved the first *Joker* movie and deeply appreciating the talent of the cast. Yet, somehow, this sequel managed to dismantle everything that made the original so captivating. This. Was. A. Hot. Dumpster. Fire. The plot meandered aimlessly, as if it had been crafted in a vacuum devoid of any coherent thought. There was no warning, no subtle indication, that those of us who admired the first would find ourselves stuck in this cinematic abyss.And the singing. Oh, the singing. As someone who adores Lady Gaga, I was prepared to be blown away, but her performances felt entirely misplaced and painfully off-key, both musically and thematically. It was as though the film had decided to throw in a musical for no discernible reason, leaving me bewildered at every note. I wanted to leave after the first hour, but out of sheer disbelief, I stayed, hoping-foolishly-that it would turn around. It didn't. Instead, it left me questioning how something so disconnected from the spirit of the original was ever allowed to exist. And we took Dave's new Jeep ... so I couldn't get out of there even if I wanted to.Even if the movie theater you're going to has pizza, don't do it. You've been warned.\",\n",

Or just Joker 2 for normal people, is a completely unneeded sequel, that got made by Todd Phillips.He decided to shred and spit on his original, praised movie, to cut himself away from the \"toxicity of Joker\".Joker in this movie goes back to miserable Arthur Fleck, who is emasculated, ridiculed and humiliated for most of the movie. He has no agency in his movie, he is just there as the events take place around him, and when he finally gets his moment it just ends with one of the dumbest decisions he could\\'ve made.The ending is the ultimate end to Joker franchise by Todd Phillips, like he wanted to make a statement about his first movie and to be perfectly sure nobody in WB will ever ask him to make another one.Movie is a boring slog, with no story, no character development, musical scenes being just there out of nowhere - just because we have Lady Gaga on screen, who is a good actress by the way, but almost everything involving Gaga is a musical, and she gets no way to actually act.Todd Phillips already showed us that he is bad at sequels with The Hangover movies - but still there was some enjoyment to be had with 2 and 3... and especially with 2.This is an insult to the fans, to the Joker and to the cast who tried their best with the crappy material they were given.

       "    'Review': \"It's incredibly disappointing to say, but Joker 2 fails to live up to the legacy of its predecessor. After the phenomenal success of Joker (2019), I, like many fans, was eagerly anticipating the sequel. The first film was groundbreaking in its portrayal of mental health, societal unrest, and the psychological descent of Arthur Fleck, brought to life masterfully by Joaquin Phoenix. It was a powerful and darkly emotional story with a stunning narrative arc and visuals that lingered in the mind long after the credits rolled. Naturally, I had high expectations for Joker 2, but unfortunately, the film fell flat in nearly every aspect.To start, the plot is almost non-existent. Unlike the first movie, which had a compelling story that kept you hooked from start to finish, Joker 2 feels aimless. There's no sense of direction, and the events that unfold seem arbitrary, almost like they're there just to fill time. The narrative doesn't build up to anything meaningful or significant, and there's a lack of the emotional depth that made the original such a standout. Instead of focusing on a coherent storyline, it seems the filmmakers opted for style over substance, and that really diminishes the experience.One of the biggest issues with Joker 2 is how predictable it is. The first movie was filled with shocking twists and moments that genuinely took you by surprise, but this sequel fails to deliver on that front. You can almost see every scene coming from a mile away, and by the halfway point, the film becomes boring because you know exactly where it's heading. There's no suspense, no tension, and nothing to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. It's frustrating to sit through a movie where every plot point is telegraphed long before it happens, and that's exactly what Joker 2 does.Character development is another area where Joker 2 falls short. In the original, we witnessed Arthur Fleck's transformation into the Joker in a slow, methodical way that felt earned and organic. In this film, however, the characters seem stagnant. There's no growth or evolution, and they don't go through any significant challenges or changes that would make them interesting. Even Joaquin Phoenix's performance, which was the highlight of the first film, feels subdued and lacking in intensity this time around. It's almost as if the actor is going through the motions without the passion and commitment he had previously shown.The pacing of the film is also a major issue. It drags on, with long stretches where nothing of significance happens. Scenes feel drawn out for no reason, and the film never really builds any momentum. By the time you reach the climax, you're left feeling underwhelmed because the movie never really earns its big moments. It's difficult to stay engaged when the film keeps losing steam every few minutes, and that's something Joker 2 never manages to overcome.Overall, Joker 2 is a huge disappointment. It lacks the heart, soul, and depth of its predecessor, and instead of building on the success of the first film, it feels like a watered-down version with none of the originality or impact. The story is weak, the characters are underdeveloped, and the film is plagued by predictability and poor pacing. If you were excited about this sequel, I'd suggest tempering your expectations because, unfortunately, it falls far short of what made the first movie so special. In the end, Joker 2 is a letdown, and not worth the time or money to see in theaters.\",\n",

If you think I'm being hyperbolic, look at the scores I typically give, 90% of the time I give movies or shows scores it's either a 9 or 10 out of 10. This movie, however, is a special kind of disgrace.What makes it even more frustrating, is unlike most garbage movies, this is well shot, well-acted, and has genuinely good moments in it. A courtroom scene in particular is remarkably well done. Visually, it's superb. But anytime an ounce of momentum gets built within the story, it's cut off by a stupid musical number and has to start over from square one. That happens time and time again until you can't wait for the movie to end.When it does, you're left wondering...how did this get made? It retroactively ruins a solid first entry, does everything it can to embarrass the most iconic villain in fiction, and was somehow still pointless. It ends exactly where the movie started. If you cut the first two hours and only left us with the final scene, nothing about the movie changes, except the audience would feel less insulted.\",\n",

To fix this film, I would have removed the musical numbers completely, noone liked it, remove all the references to the first film and possibly even remove harley alltogether. In the end when he is freed, he shoudlve been wearing the whole joker costume, gotten driven to a place by those clowns and began building his empire of chaos.

       "    'Review': 'This Film may have been the most frustrating film I have ever watched, First off the first film \"Joker\" Was terrific & should have stayed that way, Todd Philips delivered... But Todd Philips decided to be Todd Philips and make another wasteful sequel to a great stand alone story. I had low expectations but dear God it was worse than that! It is a musical... That doesn\\'t work! The dark tones the first Joker film had that made it so special and feel so good are ruined here. This is basically how the musical works, Remember when Arthur Fleck discovered those papers indicating he was adopted and Tortured as a child in the first film? Imagine if he discovered that and just started cheerfully signing after that... That\\'s what this movie is! It was so painful that is why it was a kick to the brain. I don\\'t know if I feel stupid for trying to think this would be decent or Stupid not to see the clear money grab Todd Philips just robbed of me. Please, appreciate solo stories.',\n",

I rarely walk out of movies because once I\\'ve paid for something I will force myself to sit through it but I couldn\\'t take it anymore after 1 hour and 15 minutes so I just left. It\\'s the most annoying and pointless film I can recall seeing in the 21st century. It is truly that bad.The script and \"storyline\" is so bad that you don\\'t care about the characters, what happened to them or anything they have to say let alone SING. The song choices are cringe worthy...\"Come On Get Happy\"....really? I had high hopes for this film and was one of the few people who didn\\'t have an issue with it being a musical. Until I saw it! Jesus it\\'s bad.It is so boring that I had trouble even focusing because I did not care what was happening. I got up and went to the bathroom and then to the concession stand just to break the monotony. Came back and by the time I finished my popcorn and candy I felt like I had nothing to live for any longer so I just left so I could at least listen to an audiobook in my car.Joker 2 is so bad that it has ruined my love for the first film. I will never see it the same again. I gave Joker a 10 and I\\'m giving this a 1 if that tells you anything. It\\'s not \"artsy\" as some try to claim, I love artsy, but the lack of artistical value here is staggering. The script and direction is so bad that it makes every actor seem terrible...even Oscar winner Joaquin Phoenix. Lady Gaga feels like a singer pretending to be an actress and like it\\'s her first film. They even managed to ruin her voice.This film is a tragedy. But not the sort of bad that can be enjoyed as a comedy. Outside of the cinematography there is nothing good about Joker 2. The joke is on the audience.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"The original Joker was a dark, gritty exploration of mental illness and societal decay. It was a critical and commercial success, leaving audiences stunned and disturbed. However, its sequel, Joker: Folie à Deux, is a disappointing departure from the original's success. The decision to turn the film into a musical was a baffling one that completely undermines the tone and themes established in the first film.The musical numbers in Joker: Folie à Deux feel forced and out of place. They disrupt the narrative and detract from the film's overall atmosphere. The songs are often generic and forgettable, failing to add anything meaningful to the story. Additionally, the musical style clashes with the film's dark subject matter, creating a jarring dissonance that is difficult to ignore.Beyond the musical elements, Joker: Folie à Deux suffers from a lack of compelling storytelling. The plot is predictable and the characters are underdeveloped. The film fails to capture the same intensity and emotional depth as its predecessor. The pacing is slow and the dialogue is often clunky and contrived.The ending of the film is particularly disappointing. It feels rushed and unsatisfying, leaving many questions unanswered. The conclusion is a far cry from the shocking and thought-provoking ending of the original film. It is a letdown that leaves the viewer feeling cheated and unsatisfied.In conclusion, Joker: Folie à Deux is a significant disappointment. The decision to turn the film into a musical was a major miscalculation that undermines the film's tone and themes. The storytelling is weak, the characters are underdeveloped, and the ending is unsatisfying. Fans of the original film will likely be left feeling disappointed and confused by this misguided sequel.\",\n",

I thought the first Joker had its issues, but at least it had a certain grittiness and intensity. This one? They completely ruined it by turning it into a musical. I can't even begin to explain how jarring and awkward it was to see these random musical numbers thrown into what's supposed to be a dark and psychological story. The Joker singing and dancing felt so out of place that I couldn't take the movie seriously. It's like they were trying too hard to be artsy and edgy, but it just came across as forced and ridiculous.I already don't like musicals, but this movie really drove home why I can't stand them. The singing completely took me out of the experience. Every time I started to feel like the story might go somewhere, another random song would pop up and ruin any momentum. It didn't add anything to the plot or the characters; it just made everything feel like a weird parody of what Joker was supposed to be. The tone was all over the place, and by the time the movie ended, I felt like I'd wasted my time.I'm never going to watch another musical after this. If Folie à Deux is what happens when you mix music with a supposedly serious movie, then I'm done with the whole genre. It was frustrating, pointless, and honestly a mess from start to finish.\",\n",

Victim of a broken mental health support system, victim of the guards abuse and rape at arkham asylum, victim of harley quinn dillusional infatuation, victim of life, and then ultimately a victim of stabbing and murder by a fellow inmate at arkham asylum.This was supposed to be the re-telling of one of the greatest comic book villans of all time.The joker, the great classic psychotic arch nemesis of batman. Psychotic, yes, but never a victim.Never portrayed as just some poor, pathetic, victim of his circumstances, and life.Sadly, the director did a great injustice to this great classic arch nemesis villan of batman.The director did a great injustice, and insult to the re-telling of the story of the joker.The director in killing the joker in this tragic sequel,\\nhas also killed any more story of the joker, and killed any future hope of a movie featuring the story and telling the battle between the joker and the batman.What a let down, what a disappointment.What a tragic sequel, to a great movie, the joker.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker 2: A Tedious Misfire That Misses the MarkWhen the first *Joker* movie was released in 2019, it arrived like a punch to the gut-a bold, daring take on the iconic villain that managed to be both thought-provoking and entertaining. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance captured the essence of a man spiraling into madness, set against a backdrop of societal decay, making it a cinematic masterpiece. However, any goodwill that was earned by the first film has been obliterated by *Joker 2*, a tedious, pretentious sequel that is a pale shadow of its predecessor.Let\\'s not mince words here: *Joker 2* is a complete disaster. The movie is a plodding, slow-burn slog through two hours of absolutely nothing of value. It lacks not only the excitement and intensity that defined the first film, but also any sense of direction or purpose. Instead of offering a deep dive into the psyche of its disturbed protagonist, the film meanders aimlessly, giving audiences little more than a meandering mess of disjointed scenes and underwhelming performances.To call this movie boring would be an understatement. The pacing is so glacial it makes watching paint dry feel like a thrill ride. The tension that was so palpable in the first *Joker* is nowhere to be found. Instead, we are left with long, drawn-out scenes that serve no purpose other than to test the viewer\\'s patience. Each moment feels like it was stretched out to fill time, with no regard for whether it actually contributes to the narrative or character development. The \"slow-burn\" approach might work if there was some payoff or if the scenes built towards something profound. But in *Joker 2*, there is no payoff. No crescendo. No catharsis. Just an interminable, soul-crushing march toward nothingness.And then there\\'s Lady Gaga, whose inclusion in this movie is one of its biggest missteps. The idea of casting her might have sounded good on paper, but in practice, it\\'s a monumental failure. Her portrayal is laughably bad, a grating and uninspired performance that is more annoying than anything else. To say she can\\'t sing would be too kind. It\\'s as if the filmmakers were trying to shove her into this film in an effort to make it more \"artsy\" or \"avant-garde,\" but instead, it backfires spectacularly. Every time she\\'s on screen, it feels like a bad karaoke night that refuses to end.Speaking of which, why was there so much emphasis on musical elements in this movie? Did we sign up for a crime drama or an amateur cabaret? If I wanted to sit through a painfully awkward musical performance, I\\'d watch an off-Broadway show in a basement theater. But this is supposed to be *Joker 2*-a follow-up to one of the most intense, psychological films of the past decade-and what we get instead is a painfully cringeworthy attempt at blending musical and crime drama elements that feel as mismatched as oil and water.The film, at times, resembles a bad episode of *Law and Order*-not in its best seasons, mind you, but in those filler episodes they cranked out to pad a season. The crime and tension that were integral to the first *Joker* film are now replaced by dull, predictable scenes that wouldn\\'t be out of place in a third-rate procedural. If you\\'ve seen one crime scene in this movie, you\\'ve seen them all. The drama, the stakes, the intrigue-everything that should define a great crime movie-are completely absent here.The writing is perhaps the worst offender. It\\'s as if the screenwriters forgot what made the first film work. The gritty realism, the visceral sense of tension, the tragic spiral of a man lost in his own mental instability-it\\'s all gone. Instead, we get what amounts to a second-rate art-house film trying to pass off pretension as depth. It feels like the writers believed that by slowing everything down, by dragging every scene past its breaking point, they were creating something profound. In reality, they just produced something unbearable.Even Phoenix, as talented as he is, can\\'t save this train wreck. It\\'s hard to blame him, though-what can an actor do when the script gives him so little to work with? His character feels flat, drained of the energy and complexity that made him so compelling in the first film. Gone is the tormented, unpredictable force of nature. In his place is a character so stripped of nuance that even Phoenix seems to be sleepwalking through his scenes.If you were expecting an exhilarating, thought-provoking follow-up to the first *Joker*, you will be sorely disappointed. What we have here is a vapid, tiresome exercise in patience, a film so devoid of excitement or substance that it feels like an insult to anyone who admired the original. *Joker 2* is not just bad-it\\'s offensively bad, a movie so misguided and poorly executed that it feels like a slap in the face to anyone who enjoyed the first film.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"The first Joker is in my top 10 movies of all time. But this movie was a complete disappointment. Surprisingly the musical elements worked. They really did. Ignore all the review bombs about it being a musical. Because that is not the problem here. They were one of the best parts of the movie. It was enjoyable up until around the last 20 minutes. Had me thinking I was going to love this one too. But then they take the most drastic character change possible and completely destroy the character. It's like the director set out to piss in the mouth of the fans of the first movie and fans of the Joker character. There's no other way this could have been thought of. It really seems like they set out to ruin it for the fans. If you are not a fan of the first you will probably like this. This movie completely ruins everything the first did. So please, if you are a fan of the first don't ruin it for yourself by watching this :(\",\n",

Gaga fails to capture any real chemistry with Phoenix, making their relationship dull and lifeless. The story drags on, offering little depth or tension, leaving the audience bored by an anticlimactic plot. This messy sequel is a far cry from the original's emotional impact, lacking both intensity and purpose. Even the final act, filled with unnecessary chaos, feels forced and lacks emotional payoff.

Also Lady Gaga fitted so well for the role, she could of been the the best Harley Quinn that has ever been played on cinema.Some movie directors need to retire, the actors played their part well, but the idea for the movie was moronic.

       "    'Review': 'I personally believe that Joaquin Phoenix is one of the best actors working today, from 1995\\'s To Die For to Gladiator, to Signs and Napoleon. Phoenix has a range that is among the best living actors today and yes, better than even Leonardo DiCaprio..In 2018 Phoenix finally won his first Oscar playing Arthur Fleck, otherwise known as Joker, which was more of a Martin Scorsese 70s rip off crime flick like Mean Streets and Death Wish than an actual comic book film. I personally didn\\'t like it but it was a huge box office smash that garnered 11 Oscar nominations including best picture. Critics and audiences were mixed on the first film. I, myself found it to be completely dull and far too dark, but the terrific performance by Phoenix as Arthur Fleck could not be denied and Joker was a billion dollar hit.Now five years later comes the sequel, Joker 2, AKA. Folie A Deux, which places Arthur in Arkham Asylum along with Lee AKA Harley Quinn, played by. Lady Gaga, this time around it\\'s a part musical, and part crime drama with only two real settings, the Arkham Asylum and the court where Arthur is on trial for his crimes committed in the first film.As boring as the first film was, the sequel was downright yawn inducing, I found myself looking at my watch at least a dozen times, and the musical numbers literally stop what little story there is to bounce around and become very frustrating after a while.The most infuriating thing about Joker 2 and the reason why most critics AND audiences will not care for this film is the highly controversial ending. My audience literally left the theater in complete anger asking \"what was that all about\"Joker 2 is easily the most disappointing film of 2024 so far. Todd. Phillips should go back to the gross out comedies he is known for. Joker 2 Folie A Deux was a complete mess. Joaquin Phoenix was excellent as usual, but he was the only saving grace of this disappointing mess. Wait for Joker 2 on streaming and save your money and the aggravation.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Let's cut to the chase: Joker 2 is an unholy mess-a dumpster fire wrapped in a pretentious bow. It's as if the creators decided to throw out everything that made the first film a haunting exploration of mental illness and replace it with a hollow, cliché-laden spectacle that panders to the lowest common denominator.Remember how Joker held a mirror to the darker corners of society? Well, this sequel is just a funhouse mirror, reflecting distorted caricatures of its characters while simultaneously obliterating their depth. Arthur Fleck's descent into madness was a visceral journey; here, it's just a lazy stroll through a comic book cliché.And let's talk about Harley Quinn. What happened to the brutal, chaotic love story that rocked the very foundations of their twisted relationship? Instead, we get a half-baked romance that feels more like a marketing ploy than a genuine connection. Arthur and Harley's dynamic is now as shallow as a kiddie pool, stripped of the raw emotion that made their narrative compelling.The climax? A nonsensical mess, featuring a random character who exists solely to meet a bloody end-because apparently, shocking violence is the last refuge of a lazy script. There's no coherent story arc, just a series of aimless scenes that fail to capture the essence of the original. It's as if the filmmakers threw darts at a board of plot devices and hoped for the best.The musical numbers? An auditory assault that adds nothing but further emptiness to an already vacuous experience. It's almost impressive how they managed to achieve zero emotional resonance in a film filled with song and dance.In conclusion, Joker 2 is a painful watch, a cautionary tale of what happens when studios prioritize spectacle over substance. Here's hoping the creators take a long, hard look at their choices-or, better yet, just step away from the industry entirely.\",\n",

This film is a disservice to the iconic character of the Joker and a waste of your time and money.The storyline, such as it is, is a flimsy excuse for a movie. It's a disjointed mess that jumps from scene to scene without any clear direction or purpose. The plot is so thin that it's practically transparent, and the pacing is sluggish and unengaging. Its unfortunate inclusion of gratuitous gayism in the early stages left me feeling disappointed and disengaged.What's even more disappointing is the treatment of the Joker character. The iconic villain is reduced to a caricature of himself, stripped of his complexity and depth. The portrayal is shallow and one-dimensional, lacking the nuance and psychological intrigue that has made the Joker such a compelling character in the past.The only saving grace of this film is the musical score, which is surprisingly well-done (Sarcasm hits everyone). However, it's not enough to salvage the overall experience. The music is completely overshadowed by the lackluster acting, direction, and writing.I would strongly advise against watching Joker Folie a Deux. It's a waste of your time and money, and it will leave you feeling disappointed and unsatisfied. If you're looking for a good movie, I recommend checking out something else.

While Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga deliver strong performances, the movie struggles to capture the same intensity and originality that made the first *Joker* a standout.One of the main criticisms is that the sequel feels unnecessary and lacks the gripping narrative of its predecessor. The film is described as a \"dreary, underwhelming, unnecessary slog with much of the story set in Gotham\\'s Arkham Asylum and a courtroom, which fails to engage the audience as effectively as the chaotic streets of Gotham did in the first film.The decision to incorporate musical elements, while ambitious, does not pay off. Critics have noted that the musical numbers, although showcasing Lady Gaga\\'s vocal talents, feel out of place and disrupt the film\\'s tone The courtroom drama aspect is also seen as a misstep, making the movie feel more like a drawn-out legal debate rather than a thrilling psychological explorationAdditionally, the sequel lacks the same social commentary and emotional depth that resonated with audiences in the first film. While *Joker* was praised for its raw portrayal of mental illness and societal neglect, *Folie à Deux* seems to miss the mark, offering a less impactful and more superficial narrativeIn summary, *Joker: Folie à Deux* is a letdown compared to the original. Despite strong performances from its lead actors, the film\\'s disjointed narrative, misplaced musical elements, and lack of compelling storytelling make it a sequel that many fans might find disappointing.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux falls disappointingly short of its predecessor. Instead of building on the intricate character study that captivated audiences, this sequel leans heavily into absurdity without any real depth. The plot feels disjointed and meandering, trading emotional resonance for chaotic scenes that lack purpose. While the performances remain strong, they're overshadowed by a convoluted script that seems more interested in shock value than storytelling. The once-compelling exploration of mental health becomes muddled in a sea of over-the-top theatrics. What could have been a nuanced follow-up instead feels like a desperate cash grab, leaving fans of the original feeling let down and confused.\",\n",

I really don't know what Tod Phillips is doing with this movie.I wouldn't recommend it to any DC fan. The singing scenes were so often so out of place and it felt like there was more singing than actual dialog, don't even get me started with the dialog.The 2nd part has nothing but really nothing to do with the 1st part, the sequences are shown in between, but nothing is done properly. This is a middle finger to all Joker/DC fans.

       "   {'Review Summary': 'A Disappointing Sequel That Misses the Mark',\n",
       "    'Review': \"As a huge fan of the first *Joker*, I went into *Joker 2* with high expectations. The original movie was dark, intense, and told a powerful story about Arthur Fleck's descent into madness. It was gritty and had a raw energy that made it stand out from other comic book adaptations. But sadly, *Joker 2* completely misses the mark, and to be honest, it's a massive letdown.The biggest problem with *Joker 2* is that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. The original film was very focused on its message and its tone, but this sequel is all over the place. It lacks any clear direction, and I found myself constantly wondering where the movie was going. Instead of being a tight, gripping story like the first one, it feels scattered and confused.What makes things worse is the decision to turn *Joker 2* into a musical. When I first heard that this film would include musical numbers, I was worried. It's such a strange choice for a character like the Joker, and unfortunately, my fears were confirmed. The musical element doesn't fit at all with the tone of the movie. Every time the story starts to build up some tension or emotion, it gets interrupted by a random song or dance sequence. These scenes are supposed to add something unique, but instead, they end up making the movie feel silly and unfocused.It's frustrating because there are moments in *Joker 2* where you can see glimpses of what made the first movie so great. The darker, more dramatic scenes still have potential, but they're constantly undercut by these nonsensical musical numbers. It's like the film can't decide if it wants to be a serious psychological drama or a flashy musical, and as a result, it fails at both. The musical scenes turn what could have been intense moments into awkward, boring parts of the movie.Joaquin Phoenix, who was brilliant in the first movie, feels wasted here. You can tell he's still giving it his all in certain scenes, trying to bring that same depth and intensity to Arthur Fleck's character, but the film doesn't give him the room to fully explore it. Instead, he's forced into these strange, out-of-place musical sequences that take away from his performance. It's a real shame because we know Phoenix is capable of so much more, but the movie doesn't let him shine the way it did in the original.Another issue is the pacing. *Joker 2* feels both rushed and dragged out at the same time. There are parts of the movie that feel like they're rushing through important plot points without giving them the time they need to develop, and other parts that drag on forever with no real purpose. The result is a movie that feels uneven and disjointed, and it's hard to stay engaged when the story is so all over the place.What made the first *Joker* so impactful was its slow, deliberate build-up and its focus on Arthur's character development. You could feel his descent into madness, and it was hard not to get pulled into his world. *Joker 2* lacks that same emotional punch. It's missing the subtlety and the tension that made the original so powerful, and instead, it feels like a chaotic mess.There are a few redeeming qualities in the film. The cinematography is still visually striking, and there are some moments where the film manages to capture that gritty, realistic atmosphere from the first movie. The supporting cast, including Lady Gaga, delivers solid performances, but even they can't save the movie from its own confusion.In the end, *Joker 2* just doesn't live up to the first film. It's a disappointing sequel that doesn't seem to understand what made the original so great. The musical element, in particular, feels like a huge mistake, and it turns what could have been an interesting follow-up into a confusing and boring experience. Fans of the first movie will likely walk away feeling let down, wondering how a sequel could go so wrong.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I watched this movie joker that left me utterly disappointed, and I must say, it was one of the worst cinematic experiences I have ever encountered. To anyone who is a fan of good movies, I urge you to avoid this film at all costs. From start to finish, it was a disaster in almost every possible way, leaving me thoroughly unimpressed and even frustrated by how poorly executed it was.Let me begin by addressing the characterization of the joker, which, in my opinion, was one of the biggest letdowns of the entire movie. The film attempted to bring the joker character to life, but instead of capturing the essence of this iconic villain, the filmmakers turned him into a real joke, quite literally. The portrayal was so over-the-top, exaggerated, and lacking in depth that it became almost unbearable to watch. Rather than being the menacing, cunning, and psychologically complex character that fans of the genre are familiar with, the joker in this movie was reduced to a caricature. It was almost as if the filmmakers completely misunderstood the appeal of the character and decided to make a mockery of him instead.But the problems didn't stop with just the characterization. The direction of the movie was equally appalling. I've seen bad direction before, but this one took it to a whole new level. There seemed to be no coherent vision, no clear narrative direction, and no sense of pacing. The scenes were disjointed and felt like they were thrown together without much thought or purpose. There was no flow, and at times, it felt like the movie didn't know where it was going. Transitions between scenes were jarring, and instead of building tension or suspense, the film stumbled from one poorly executed scene to another, leaving the audience confused and disengaged.The acting was another major issue. It's hard to believe that talented actors were involved in this project because the performances were utterly lackluster. It felt as though the actors themselves didn't believe in the script or their characters. There was no emotional depth, no connection between the characters, and no chemistry that could have salvaged the weak plot. The lines were delivered in a way that was either too flat or overly dramatic, making it hard to take the movie seriously. It's rare to find a film where almost every performance feels phoned in, but this was one of those rare cases.The movie's beginning was another sore point. Right from the first scene, it became apparent that the film was going to be a tough watch. The start was abrupt, poorly written, and did nothing to establish the world or the characters. There was no build-up, no intrigue, and no reason to care about what was happening. It felt as though the filmmakers were trying too hard to jump straight into the action without setting up any meaningful context. This lack of a solid foundation made it difficult to become invested in the story or care about the outcome.The ending was no better. After enduring two hours of bad direction, acting, and storytelling, the film concluded with one of the worst endings I've ever seen. It was rushed, unsatisfying, and left more questions than answers. Rather than providing a resolution or tying up any loose ends, the movie just abruptly ended, leaving the audience in a state of disbelief. It was as if the filmmakers simply gave up on trying to create a coherent ending and decided to stop the movie without offering any closure.To top it all off, the dialogues in the film were atrocious. The lines were poorly written, often cringe-worthy, and lacked any sense of wit, intelligence, or emotional weight. The dialogue was so bad that it became unintentionally funny at times, which only further detracted from the movie's already weak attempt at serious storytelling.In conclusion, I would strongly advise anyone who values their time and enjoys good cinema to skip this movie altogether. It's not worth watching, even out of curiosity.\",\n",

The entire hall was filled with boredom, despite it being a special screening of the film. Everyone felt bored, and half the audience even fell asleep. And when we finally reached the climax and everyone was expecting something to happen... nothing did. If you asked someone to come up with the worst possible ending for this film, it still wouldn\\'t compare to the sheer absurdity of the actual ending.This film might become one of the worst in the last five years, not just because of its poor quality, but because of the downfall from a record-breaking film that was agreed upon by both critics and audiences, to a repulsive movie that\\'s hard to finish watching.',\n",

Another major reason why this movie is boring is the lack of compelling characters. Good films typically offer protagonists and antagonists who are layered, flawed, and interesting. In contrast, the characters in this movie are one-dimensional, with little depth or development. The viewer doesn't care about their motivations or struggles because they come across as clichés rather than real people. There's no emotional connection, which is crucial for any movie's success.\",\n",

It attempts to engage viewers but ultimately wastes time on pointless side stories that go nowhere, and instead of a fulfilling experience, it layers nostalgia in a desperate bid to justify the wasted time.Transforming the entire story into a musical in an effort to extend the film was, quite frankly, one of the worse choices made in production; I genuinely don't understand the decision to take this direction, as the songs feel out of place within the narrative. While I've been quite critical so far, I've tried to keep this review spoiler-free for those still interested in watching. If there is any silver lining, it would be the film's potential, although I remain puzzled by the random appearance of rainbow flags in certain scenes.\",\n",

Instead all they focused on was Joaquin getting beat and tortured by the guards, throughout the movie. We already saw that in the first movie.What they should've done was cut the beatings, torture and singing and instead focused more on tying things up in the courtroom, and revealing the truth about Thomas Wayne and his mother. Bringing Alfred on the witness stand would've been a great scene, with him telling Arthur Fleck in person that Thomas Wayne was really his Father and Bruce being his half brother. This would've at least gave him some closure and a little bit of happiness, instead of constant beatings and sadness, which is all this second movie is about.

       "    'Review': 'Watching *Joker 2* was like taking a bite of a delicious-looking sandwich only to find out the middle is just air. Sure, Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga brought their A-game with their acting and surprisingly impressive vocals, especially Phoenix. Gaga\\'s Harlequin album is a treat, and the film\\'s visuals are definitely eye-candy. The twist at the end? Oh, it did a cartwheel over our expectations and hinted at more stories to come. But did I enjoy it? I think the jury\\'s still out.Now, let\\'s talk pacing-or lack thereof. There were high notes like the courtroom drama and Phoenix\\'s performances, but in between, we had enough filler to rival a Thanksgiving turkey. Sophie Dumond and Puddles could\\'ve held the show together if the story had just let them. Instead, we got Harleen Quinzel, who was basically given a cameo instead of a character arc. Seriously, you don\\'t cast Gaga and then make her sing in the shadows! And Arthur Fleck? His character development was more like character \"stallment.\" The movie dangled the promise of growth or spectacular downfall, only to leave us hanging with a poetic non-resolution. As a metaphor, it works. As a satisfying story? Not so much.',\n",

But the \"deeper message\" is actually very straight forward. The problem with this film is the plot line, which contains very little action and therefore the drama relies on the scripting, which was disappointingly poor and boring.In terms of the musical aspect to the film, it\\'s not like Grease or The Greatest Showman, however I would say this Joker is a musical. Not all of the songs felt out of place, however some were too much.Overall, this film is a lame idea on physiological illness which isn\\'t as clever as some believe, with little scripting or action to accompany it.',\n",

So many layers to this & anyone who felt unsatisfied by the film, this was the point. You're left feeling exactly how Arthur felt his whole life. Unsatisfied, unfulfilled and searching for something he'd never have! I felt a rollercoaster of emotions, I was laughing, crying, singing. This movie holds a mirror up to how society doesn't care about the broken, they just want the pain and suffering, and the Joke is on the audience which I think is genuis.

       "    'Review': \"A joker fan's rant (not the joker we saw): joker is a criminal mastermind, in my view the most evil and well written dc comic book villain. He is cruel, inhumane and he has no goal or aspiration but to see chaos prevail. He has no super power, but he manages with his cruelty to remain one of the most famous villains amongst fans. What I loved in the first movie was how well they depicted the human part of this favorite villain of mine in a way that perfectly aligned with his descend to madness: the product of a cruel world returns the cruelty he experienced tenfold.So in that aspect at the beginning of the second movie I had high expectations that I would see the same thing only magnified: the immense cruelty that will snap Arthur Fleck and irreversibly create the monster we all love. But no, to my utter disappointment Arthur never breaks free from his sane, weak self and so dies as the weak, lonely creature he is, broken and sad. I feel like I went to see the joker and saw just a musical drama with no punchline. I am very sad that such a good first movie was not followed by the sequel it deserved. It was miserable, frustrating and sometimes just cringe (Harley pregnant? Really? And why so many songs..)\\nTwo stars just for Joaquin Phoenix who is oscar-worthy in a very disappointing movie.\",\n",

This all said, the film is radically different to the original. The music was used to amplify rather that amuse - which is how it seems. There is significant violence in the film, but not enough basic storytelling action. Two hours of my life lost. A director's cut (maybe by another director) might be worth a look. A shame.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'What is the point? This is the question I found myself asking throughout the film. Being a big fan of the 2019 Joker I was excited for this film and intrigued by the addition of Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn. The film starts out good enough, but is quickly disrupted by unnecessary musical numbers that will leave you begging for the film to get back to the original plot. However, this is continued throughout the movie with the flow of the film being constantly interrupted by unnecessary and unwanted musical numbers. It just doesn\\'t have the same feeling as the 2019 movie. The first film was eerie, focused a lot on mental health, and really made you uncomfortable and feel bad for Arthur. This one however is a boring \"court drama meets broadway musical\" abomination. The ending of the film will have you ultimately asking \"what was the point?\" What was the point of the musical scenes? What was the point of adding Harley Quinn? What was the point of Arthur representing himself? What was the point of the courtroom explosion? What was the point of Arthur becoming the Joker altogether? What was the point of this entire film? You honestly can\\'t help but feel like it was intentionally made bad. No amount of good acting could save this abomination of a film.',\n",

Joker 2 promises a deep dive into the minds of Gotham's darkest characters but instead takes us on a meandering stroll through unremarkable and pedestrian cityscapes that could be anywhere, not the Gotham we know. The direction is as listless as the plot, with scenes dragged out beyond reason and no urgency or intensity to the story. Gotham isn't menacing or dark-it's just any old city, stripped of the gritty, malignant personality that usually defines it. Watching, I immediately wished Heath Ledger's Joker could burst onto the screen to breathe life into this lackluster version.Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga put in the work, but even their solid performances can't save the film from itself. The few bursts of action were teased in the trailer, so don't expect anything fresh. It's as if the director decided to turn Joker into a two-hour waiting room with mood music. It's the cinematic equivalent of watching paint dry. Don't waste your time, see The Substance to be mesmerized by Demi, or Strange Darling for a bit of sadistic fun.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Arthur Fleck was a harrowing character study, a one-man show capturing Arthur Fleck\\'s transformation into the Joker. Its gritty realism and psychological depth were its selling points. Todd Phillips\\' sequel, however, strayed from this formula, losing the original\\'s essence. Where \"Joker\" was intimate and raw, \"Joker 2\" felt like it was reaching for spectacle, diluting the powerful singular focus of its predecessor. Introduced into this delicate formula was Lady Gaga. While a talented performer, her inclusion altered the dynamics significantly. Instead of blending seamlessly into the dark tapestry of Gotham, her presence felt somewhat disjointed. Her portrayal, possibly a nod to her musical prowess, clashed with the tone set by Joaquin Phoenix\\'s Arthur. This not only distracted from the narrative but also undermined the gritty realism that made the first film so impactful. The seamless storytelling of \"Joker\" was lost in the sequel. Todd Phillips seemed to aim for a broader narrative scope, yet this choice backfired. The tight, introspective focus of Arthur\\'s world expanded, but not in a way that added depth or coherence. Instead, it felt fragmented, as if multiple storylines were vying for attention without a clear sense of direction.Dilution of Themes: \"Joker\" tackled themes of mental illness and societal neglect with precision. \"Joker 2,\" however, wavered in its thematic focus. The powerful undercurrents of the original were replaced with more convoluted, less impactful messages, diluting the emotional and psychological resonance that had captivated audiences initially.The tonal consistency of \"Joker\" was one of its strengths. The sequel, however, struggled to maintain this, oscillating between its dark roots and a more theatrical, almost operatic presentation. This shift created a dissonance that was jarring for viewers expecting a continuation of the first film\\'s somber realism. In essence, while attempting to expand the universe of \"Joker,\" Todd Phillips lost sight of the intimate, character-driven narrative that made the first film a success. Lady Gaga\\'s performance, though not without merit, contributed to this departure, further distancing \"Joker 2\" from the original\\'s raw, unfiltered portrayal of Arthur Fleck\\'s descent into madness. The result was a film that, despite its ambitions, fell short of the bar set by its predecessor.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"The first movie was an absolute masterpiece. Building up a great personage, emotion, you really start feeling for Joker. And trust me, this was proof that Joaquin Phoenix was an absolute 100% match for this role. You would expect that the producers saw how absolutely fabulous the movie was, how well it was received by viewers and the amount of hype people had.Then they decided to do this. A musical movie which has no emotion, nothing grabbing the viewers, no action, nothing of the sort which belongs in Gotham. Lady Gaga besides Joaquin Phoenix is a joke. I just can't believe what they did here. 80% of the movie feels like singing and music, but it doesn't strike any interest in me. During the movie, 20% left before the break. Another 15-20 people left after the break, before the ending of the movie. There I was, expecting things to turn around and become better, but nope. Sadly that wasn't the case. I am not giving this a 1 star rating as I love Joaquin Phoenix, but 2 stars because something like this should never, ever, repeat itself.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Folie a Deux - a madness/delusion shared by 2: unfortunately, appears not to relate so much to the characters in the film as it does the film writers,\\nScott Silver and Todd Phillips. How they came to some of the 'creative' decisions they did, can only have been through some kind of shared madness.This film failed on so many fronts. Joaquin Phoenix performed very well again and Gaga did OK too in that respect.Making it a musical though was just a stupid idea. I mean, it ain't exactly the fare of your typical Mamamia fan is it? What's the plan here: to make it into a stage show? If so, I'll be there for sure, on opening night: with a truck of rotten tomatoes. And Broadway shall become La Tomatina!At the start, you could kinda look past a couple of the songs as being momentary drifts into fantasy but before long, the pattern becomes apparent - that hackneyed lazy pattern - a tiny little plot development before... ah crap, I can feel another one coming - yep, repeated gratuitous pointless musical diversions that fail to progress the story or develop the characters but just serve to each add a few more minutes to the run-time.Even if we ignore the decision though, to hitch a farcical ride on the coat tails of LaLaLand, there were crimes that completely invalidate the worth of this movie, worst of which: writers broke canon so badly (I'm no comic book nerd fussing over details but these were no details) that this character simply was no longer Joker and Gaga's character really wasn't Harley Quinn.Joker, nemesis to Batman, is chaotic, frenetic, clever: crazy, yes but charismatic. But most of all, he is successful - an arch villain! The character in this movie lived and died without transcending 'sad loser' status. He certainly never came close to being an arch villain. He did a crime on TV, got famous and got caught - so what?Similarly his girlfriend was really just a saddo hybristophiliac - there was nothing brilliant about her, nothing special or 'beautifully twisted' she wasn't even particularly mental - just a little messed up, and a bit stupid.I'm not blaming the actors here, they played well but the characters were, all said and done, flimsy nobodies that bore no resemblance to their namesakes other than the most superficial of traits. Frankly, they were little more than stolen names.Thing is though, there were moments of opportunity, when it could all have been pulled back - when our doubt, that there was ever anything truly significant about these characters, could have been smashed, exploded, vaporised with a little twist in the plot. But no, it never came and in the end they were just a couple of insignificants who got their 15 minutes of fame in New York (Oops erm we mean Gotham, your honour) and faded away again. Just as I trust this film will from my memory.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'It would be interesting to know the backstory of how they decided to turn this sequel into a musical. Did they decide on that before they casted it and then they went and got Lady Gaga, or did they get Lady Gaga first and then say, \"well we have Lady Gaga, let\\'s make it a musical!\"Either way it was a poor decision and not something anyone was expecting, asking for or, at least in the case of this viewer, wanting. Maybe that was the point, they were trying to do something different and unexpected, but unfortunately it just didn\\'t work for me. It might have worked to some degree if it wasn\\'t such a prominent part of the movie and if the rest of the movie had more to offer, but putting a legal procedural that did a lot of rehashing of the first movie around the musical fell flat and just didn\\'t entertain.Just an all-around disjointed flop and to be clear, none of that is on Joaquin Phoenix or Lady Gaga who are both talented actors and do the best they can with the material. It\\'s 100% on the writers and producers who, in the name of boldness(?) managed to follow up a great movie with one of the worst sequels ever.Sad and disappointed for what could have been.',\n",

The joker could have been a action packed massacre with jaw dropping monologues that delve into the psychiatry whilst the over blown action portrays an unhinged menace that rose the batman.

I didn't watch a trailer or read any reviews about this film on purpose as I didn't want to ruin any of the 'excitement' of the film. I naturally expected the film to be amazing, like the first film. Having now watched the film, I feel very disappointed. I didn't realise it was going to have loads of outbursts of singing in it! The singing (and there was A LOT of singing) came at really annoying points when you would much rather a storyline/charscters being developed instead. To be fair, Joaquin Phoenix was excellent as usual but I was hoping that his character would develop more than it did. In fact, nothing much actually happened in the film and I started to feel quite bored in many parts, especially the singing bits. Towards the end I was willing the film to end just because nothing had really happened for over 2 hours apart from about 15 (boring) songs. By the time the end twist came I felt so bored that I didn't really care what happened and it didn't seem shocking or exciting. I was just glad to leave the cinema! What a shame for what had so much potential.\",\n",

And after a long 5-year wait for the sequel, we get this dumpster fire that personally feels insulting as a fan.Watching this movie, it was clear to me that WB saw this as a cash grab and probably forced Todd Phillips to make the sequel since the first one made over a billion dollars. And the worst part? Making it a musical. Let me be clear on one thing. No one, and I mean absolutely no one, asked for a musical. But unfortunately this is the kind of story-telling Hollywood seems to like as they inject it into a lot of movies/TV shows.Secondly, the ending scenes essentially retcon everything we've seen from the first movie. From him deliberately renouncing his Joker persona to finally being killed by one of his fellow Arkham inmates who, as it turns out, is the actual Joker of this universe. Which means Arthur was never the Joker to begin with.After the DCEU's abysmal performance and eventual demise, this franchise was the one of the only good things DC and WB had going for them, until greed and bad decisions took over, producing a mess that is now not only hated by Joker fans, but the wider comic book audience.Joaquin Phoenix, as always, nails his role as the character while Lady Gaga was fine. But even their performances had no shot at saving this film. Like the DCEU, the Joker franchise also meets its inevitable end as Todd officially confirmed that he was stepping away from DC.The bottomline? Joker: Folie a Deux is a terrible film and I would not recommend it at all.\",\n",

The first film, starring Joaquin Phoenix was a veritable masterpiece that left the audience chomping at the bit for more. It was an elegant commentary on the downfall of society in a fictitious New York City, and the outcasts that were shadows, ignored by the elites, with a heavy look into mental health. This continuation was none of that. It lacked direction and the tempo was inconsistent. Every time a storyline would get going and the audience was drawn in, there would be yet another musical number, turning a flowing movie into a staccato of disconnect. This film feels like a loose Joker story that's been precariously wrapped around a Lady Gaga album, and not her good ones either. There was very little that redeems this movie, apart from the sets and costuming. Phoenix is an amazing, talented actor, but even he could not make this series rise from the ashes.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I just saw Joker 2 in the cinema, and boy, oh boy, it is, well, terrible. As others have mentioned, it is not because the acting, music, direction, singing, or any other obvious aspect of it is bad. It is all very well executed, and Gaga, Pheonix and everybody else did a good job. Bravo, well done.So yes, it does not deserve one star.So what is wrong with it? Well read on to find out.The first movie, although not perfect, was very good. Why can't the first movie just be left alone then? Does everything very good, need a sequal?Because this sequal, tries the very best it can to UNDO everything that happened in the first movie. It tries to rectify, all the evil of the world (Gotham) and make everything right again. I will not be going into any more detail than that, because that will spoil both the first movie, and this one.But we as an audience, don't need anything to be put to rights! We don't need anything that the second movie has to offer: We are in the theater to escape our miserable lives, and to be entertained for two and a half hours. To watch something even more miserable, which this is, is not an escape.So what makes this movie so miserable you ask? Hold on to your popcorn, because here it comes:THIS SEQUAL wants us to NOT forget that Joker is fiction, and that to me, seeking an escape from reality, is the biggest insult of all.I am not stupid. I know Joker is fiction, I don't need to be told this through a movie with the same name.Should I feel guilty for routing for Joker in the first movie? According to this movie: Yes, I should be very ashamed indeed.So yes, I am sorry folks. If you can, avoid this movie at all costs! It is an insult to everyone involved with cinema, and everybody who just wants an escape, every once in a while.\",\n",

Joaquin Phoenix's amazing performance from the original movie is dragged down by a poor script and random musical numbers that don't fit at all. There are way too many pointless scenes that add nothing, and the whole thing lacks the emotional punch that made the first movie so powerful. Instead of the gritty and intense feel we loved, we get a sequel that feels lost and disappointing. It's a shame because it ruins what could have been a great follow-up, leaving fans frustrated, confused, and wishing it had never been made at all.\",\n",

Lady Gaga was only included in this film to sing, because her portrayal of Harley was awful. Someone, anyone, please, destroy this disappointment movie and create a new one that reflects what we saw in the first movie: a rising Joker who eventually will be amazing criminal. The worst part of the movie was the ending. If I could throw anything out of this film, it would be the singing and the ending.\"',\n",

The only positive aspect is Phoenix' acting ability. Lady Gaga's character is an empty shell without any character depth, development, or good acting.The most annoying part is that just because there's Lady Gaga in it the main characters now have to sing forgettable musical numbers every few minutes. When she started singing yet again I could see people in the cinema rolling their eyes.Above all, this movie does not really have an entertaining story and manages to convey almost nothing of interest in it's long runtime. I think it's an insult to the first movie and all DC and Joker fans to give us such an unneeded sequel that dies not add anything new to the first.One of Joker 2 Quotes to summarize it perfectly: Stop always singing to me and talk to me.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"With only three location sets and 1 two minute exterior shot Todd Phillips managed to not justify spending 4 times the budget ($55million-$200million) of Joker 1. He also managed to abandon the theme of responsibilities of societal breakdown through a criminologists angle of cutting social services (that actually happened in the Regan administration) by putting the blame solely on Arthur. Todd Phillips also managed to abandon the continuity of an older Joker at the end of Joker 1 by not allowing him to exist past Joker 2. Even if the ending of Joker 2 was a metaphor of his crazy side taking over... there wasn't a realistic buildup for it to make sense. Harley Quinn is just turned into an obsessed fangirl who has the superpower to walk in and out of a prison/psych ward because she feels like it. Arthur loses his agency that he gained at the ending of Joker 1. The film almost feels like it's trying to destroy its own character as a backlash of Incel comparisons the first film created, this film fails at doing that if that's the case, it's far too hollow of a film to accomplish that without quality (outside of its cinematography and Joaquin's acting) it needs layers and adequate storytelling to do that. I did not like this film, I will still like the first film far more and thinks this film deserves a disappointing 2/10.\",\n",

One moment i felt even sleepy and forced myself not to.Lady Gaga's performance, which was highly anticipated, fell flat.

The musical aspect added nothing to the movie, other than probably inflating the budget due to the set pieces. There is very clearly a hatred for the character of Joker, and all efforts were made to cleave Joker from Arthur. Lady Gaga sings and acts well, but looks weirdly out of place.Honestly just think that the 1st one was a standalone piece and don't bother sullying the memories of that masterpiece by associating it with this joke made at the expense of the audience.\",\n",

Fifteen minutes after, I started thinking oh ok, I can sort of understand why they've decided to add some musical numbers. But then, and for the rest of the 2hr 18 minutes film I kept asking myself what the actual (expletive) am I watching here?!? This is truly awful!I really enjoyed the first film and whilst I think it took a reductionist approach to mental illness I still believe that the first film was well directed, with some of the visuals being pure magic at times. Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant, the supporting cast led by Robert de Niro was excellent.Folie à Deux is, simply put, a pointless film and I expect it to be a monumental flop. I can only imagine the early development workshops for this film. 'How about we take our celebrated film in a completely different direction! Let's not have a story or a plot to drive it, let's chuck in Lady Gaga because she's still appealing to 12% of our preferred demographic meaning that we can turn this into a musical, but (here's the key concept) we'll only include the most irritating music imaginable.' To which the Executive Producers respond: 'I like it!'An angry score of 2 stars because I'm generous. 1 star each for Joaquin Phoenix for his portrayal of a sad, weak and pathetic joker and Lady Gaga who was surprisingly good (pointless but good). Anyone who enjoyed the original will in all likelihood hate this sequel. Save your money, let it flop.\",\n",

And that is one of the main issues of what is wrong with this.The other main issue is the complete absence of chemistry between the two leads.

       "    'Review': 'Joker: Folie à Deux delivers some truly great performances, particularly by Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga. Phoenix once again proves his depth as an actor, embodying the chaotic, tortured psyche of Arthur Fleck with precision. Lady Gaga brings intensity to her role, and their chemistry is palpable. However, despite the strong acting, the film falters significantly in other areas.The story lacks coherence and feels disconnected from the foundation built in the first Joker film. The narrative seems to meander without clear direction, relying too much on spectacle and musical numbers rather than meaningful plot development. What could have been a deep dive into shared psychosis or a compelling exploration of two fractured minds instead becomes muddled and overly abstract.Additionally, the movie drags on far too long, with many scenes feeling stretched beyond necessity. This pacing issue, combined with a disjointed story, makes it a slog to get through. While the performances keep it from being a total failure, Joker: Folie à Deux ultimately feels like a missed opportunity, weighed down by its own ambition.',\n",

Trying to make a character like Arthur Fleck sympathetic to the point of being an anti-hero is questionable story telling at best. He's ill and was let down by poor healthcare but that's more about how terrible the U. S. is about that sort of thing, not indicative to how a society(tm) let him down. Not having accountability means you're not a good person.Anyway, I don't want to really give anything away but I found this to be very boring and overstuffed with nonsense.

Young people wouldn\\'t have heard them, and would think (correctly) that Warner Brothers is a fuddy-duddy old movie maker. And in the next scene the Joker is bashing the (fantasy) judge\\'s head in.

They ruin all of the excellent gritty acting from Phoenix.They could EASILY be replaced by a storyline where (in his head) he relives his abusive childhood. As it is, he is on a hiding to nothing, and the only surprise is what happens at the end.Gratuitous over-use of cigarette smoking (\"because we can, being an \\'historical\\' piece\") diverted me from getting inside the Joker\\'s pain. And I\\'m a smoker!And the Joker\\'s closing argument could have been FAR better than what it was. For example, an eloquent summing-up of the good vs evil that was continuing in his brain could serve to create doubt in the minds of the jury. His admission, however, that he smothered his mother did, in fact, confirm the judge\\'s opinion that he was grandstanding, albeit low-key.Can\\'t work out what Gaga\\'s character gets out of it or what she is supposed to be, especially when she \\'finds\\' him after the \\'escape\\' (a psychic, perhaps?). The police, too, must have been using clairvoyants to track him down so quickly.Mind you, the whole movie could have simply taken place inside his head.',\n",

The decisions of the characters are not relatable not even in a irrational way. They just filmed a teen romance story with the Joker. Also the storyline was very predictable. It was even obvious that the Joker will be killed. Also why did they make it a musical, switching the theme is very risky and mostly ends very bad, visible on this example.

       "    'Review': \"Joaquin Phoenix was amazing , although, this movie fails, why ?!Because of Lady Gaga.. who sabotages, sucks all the good energy out of every movie mood and out of every Star attractiveness aura while professionally performing in each movie (like she did to Bradley Cooper too) .. compare how Joaquin Phoenix acted as in love with her by using convincing eye contacts, oppositely she acted with her nose which didn't show any love, the director should ve put them together in continuous prova till she sharpen her talent up to his level .. Margot Robbie performed Harley Quinn perfectly and she convinced us for having chemistry with Jared LetoBecause of forcing it to be musical (and with no creative nor attractive musical sentences & rythem), but they did it musical to fill the blank gaps.Because the joker (Joaquin Phoenix) fans are not Lady Gaga's fans .. May be Amy Winehouse would fit more and her fans would agree.Because the writer sabotaged every climax in this movie .. first climax sabotaged was when he said I'm not joker and she left the court .. second climax sabotaged was when he left the taxi cab car after being free .. third one when the police caught him again .. fourth one when he is bleeding on the floor .. the writer should ve left a climax satisfying the fans whichever bad or happy ending.Because the director wanted to simulate mood and art direction of The Dark Knight but he's not Christopher Nolan.Because again, Lady Gaga has no charismatic aura.. she destroyed the great performance of Joaquin Phoenix and his attractiveness.\",\n",

Really loved the first part and I knew that some musical aspects where involved here, but was not prepared for a whole \"musical\" (taking into account that producers denied this to be a musical in first place) . The style neither fits in the overall lore nor does it do the weak story any good, it went straight strongly annoying after the third song. Regarding the story the script is super weak and without spoiling any big parts (wouldn\\'t be a loss though), it mashes all the good the prequel has build up directly in the dirt. To conclude I wished I could undo watching the second part of Joker and just leave the first movie with an open ending in my mind.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker 2 is a disappointing follow-up that fails to offer anything new to the story or its characters. The film leans heavily on musical sequences to fill the runtime, sacrificing meaningful development. Lady Gaga's performance as Harley Quinn lacks conviction-she plays more of a version of herself than the complex, chaotic character fans expect. Her chemistry with the Joker feels off, as the power dynamic between them is reversed. Instead of Harley being obsessed with the Joker, it feels like the Joker is the one clinging to her, which makes DC's most iconic villain look weak and unthreatening. This portrayal softens the Joker into a shadow of the menacing figure he's meant to be, leaving fans missing Margot Robbie's far more engaging and authentic Harley Quinn.\",\n",

It's simply the exposure of Arthur Fleck as a disturbed, abused man who killed six people; not the story of The Joker and Harley Quinn, two of the greatest comic book, TV, and movie villains of all time. Lady Gaga and River Phoenix sing, dance, and fight and give it their all so they each get a star in this review. Cinematography, costumes, the entire cast, and set design are all incredible. All are wasted on a terrible script and bleak ending that nails the coffin shut for The Joker. There's no heart, no action, no heroics.

I love Pennies From Heaven and Dancer in the Dark and there are tonal similarities.Joaquin Phoenix was great as usual-he is probably one of the most solid actors we have right now, always believable as the role he inhabits, and not simply playing himself over and over. His Arthur Fleck is a great character, even if he is Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin under greasepaint. Lady Gaga I'm not so fond of, though she does elevate the musical numbers as to be expected.The story is...boring? After a genuinely enjoyable opening, it never goes anywhere. It's a courtroom drama. Really. There's a moment where you think 'Ah! Finally!' but that peters out as well.My first issue with this film was one aspect of the ending, which is that audiences these days are seemingly not allowed to enjoy anything for any reason. If they do, said thing is 'bad' and must be spoiled for them. It is beyond tiresome and at this point I'm almost completely weaned from watching any new films whatsoever-we do have this fabulous global catalog to pick from. The trope is beyond overdone.My second issue is that telling a mentally ill man that they're getting what they deserve before icing them is tone deaf to the message that THEY created in the first place. Sometimes I wonder what people in Hollywood are even thinking when they write this garbo, other than 'I want more money.'\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'The cartoonish portrayal of the Joker at the beginning made me look forward to the development of the plot.It\\'s obvious that Lady Gaga\\'s involvement changed the second movie into a musical.The Joker fits this image perfectly - life is a stage, a life of song and dance. There are many of Arthur\\'s fantasy-like music videos, and he lives between reality and fantasy.Joaquin\\'s acting is still breathtaking. The performances by the actors are great. His laughing-while-crying face tugs at your heartstrings. What amazed me even more was how well he could sing. Unfortunately, due to the script, all of this had already been seen in the first movie, with no real breakthrough.Lady Gaga\\'s acting is very \"Gaga.\" She\\'s confident, mysterious, bold, and fearless. To me, she doesn\\'t quite come across as Harley Quinn. If you say she\\'s crazy, she\\'s not even that crazy - Gaga\\'s own music videos are way more wild. She even takes a restrained approach, playing a calm lunatic. I noticed that she mainly uses head voice resonance when singing this time, making her voice lighter, perhaps trying to mimic an ordinary person\\'s singing. Only when the plot reaches a high point does she switch to her signature chest voice resonance.The script is terrible. The overwhelming background sound effects and canned laughter bombard you. It tries to combine psychological conflict with romantic love, giving off a \"La La Land\" vibe at one point. The Joker\\'s dialogue in court lacks charisma, and the social collapse is portrayed as some kind of baseless heroism.Arthur chooses himself over the Joker, killing the supporters\\' hopes for a symbol against classism and also disappointing Harley Quinn, causing her to leave.Just when the courtroom is blown open by a bomb and Arthur escapes, I thought the legendary rise of the Joker was about to begin.But instead, he runs away in panic, evading help from his fans. He walks to the Joker\\'s iconic staircase, humbly trying to keep Harley Quinn, only for her to reject him through song. Harley Quinn should have been a fangirl, but she becomes the one leading this romantic relationship. Although this aligns with Arthur\\'s character - wanting to be loved and accepted - he ends up being stabbed to death as an ordinary bystander when he\\'s caught again. It leaves you speechless.Is the director trying to prove that Arthur remains at the bottom of society, that even after turning evil, it\\'s not some turning point where his life takes off?With such high ratings and expectations, I\\'m surprised the director chose this direction for the plot - meaningless and forgettable. The psychological element overshadows the actual plot progression, and there\\'s not as strong a sense of being oppressed as in the first movie, leaving the character with no reasonable cause for going mad and doing evil. The Joker should be a chaotic and unpredictable character, but most of the plot takes place in a prison, and in the end, he reverts back to being weak.It wastes good actors and great performances on a terrible script and story.A failed commercial film. The box office will probably flop.',\n",

More than one online periodical is arguing that this movie was made with malice towards the Batman franchise, as well as its fans, some news outlets even applauding this decision: hailing it as a \"subversion\" of the superhero genre.Fans of the comic books and prior Batman movies regard the Joker as the criminal mastermind and complex character he was originally written to be. Those moviegoers are expecting a tense and violent drama, hearty action sequences, and blood and gore. The decision to greenlight a musical and legal procedural Joker sequel is a massive faux pas; one that cannot be excused thru ignorance or even creativity. No, this decision was done knowing the consequences, which are now manifesting as disbelief, anger, frustration and a pathetic box office reception.One of my acting teachers in Manhattan explained to me that \"America does not want to come home to Medea\", meaning that the average American comes home from a brutal day at work and is received by chores, disobedient children, bills, endless worries and never-ending demands. They want to relax. They want to be entertained. There is a time and place for thoughtful, deeply reflective cinema, and this is not it. -- There is absolutely nothing wrong with a subculture of action movie goers -- They appreciate the fun and excitement the excessive violence causes them to feel. It\\'s fiction and fantasy and has its place in our life as a distraction; one that the incredibly responsible working class deserves.For Hollywood millionaires and their lackeys to be able to suggest, authorize, produce and distribute such an incredibly pompous and miserly film using a franchise that stands for the exact opposite themes it embodies is a clear sign of an industry gone terribly wrong. An industry that answers to no one and is funded under feigned interest to inform and educate when it clearly patronizes with disdain, untroubled by any repercussions.',\n",

Director Todd Philips crafts the story of Joker and Harley Quinn and the romance surrounding them but despite it's production, costumes, and performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga being solid, Joker: Folie à Deux ends up falling into issue of style over substance which causes the movie fall into the lines of: pretentious filmmaking.Joker was a solid movie that has some interesting themes and concepts while being slightly bloated with itself. Unfortunately, this sequel ends up being a bit too full of itself with its simple narrative that ends up making it's themes feel bloated, predictable, and honestly, uninteresting. The atmosphere, musical score, production, and style tries to make it seem the narrative is better and greater, however, as a whole, the narrative is really messy and basic which really drags the movie down and makes it feel like a bore fest. On the musical score, the musical score is solid but the singing was mostly alright and the songs are pretty forgettable.The characters of Joker and Harley have some interesting charm and dynamics between them, but despite the strong performance from Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, the laughably dialogue, uninteresting side characters, and tone that takes itself WAY too seriously doesn't do much justice. Including Philips' direction being kind of all over the place.Philips really tries to grasp hard to move away from the derivative comedy movies in his past career and lean into dramatic works but unfortunately, he seems to fail to stray away from it.At the end, Todd Philips tries to make something serious but unfortunately fails to successfully strive with a dramatic tale.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I went to see this movie despite all the negative buzz, doing my best to avoid reading the bad reviews so that I could form my own opinion. I walked in with an open mind, hoping to give it a fair chance. Unfortunately, it didn't take long for me to start understanding the criticism that surrounded it.The film felt like it could have been condensed into a 20-minute prologue for something much larger in scope. Instead, we were subjected to countless scenes of Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker simply smoking. I didn't keep track, but I swear there must have been at least 50 shots of them doing just that. The entire movie felt confined-largely set in a prison cell and courtroom-with little variety or exploration beyond that.Initially, I found the introspection into the Joker's life and the consequences of his actions intriguing. But as the film dragged on, it became tiresome and repetitive. Lady Gaga, an undeniable talent, was woefully underutilized. There were plenty of musical numbers, but not one of them stood out, especially when compared to films like The Greatest Showman or La La Land, which were packed with memorable songs. Here, the music was raspy and almost unbearable at times-an odd experience given that I generally enjoy Lady Gaga's voice and music. In this movie, however, her songs fell flat and, at moments, even hurt my ears. It left me bewildered that such a talented artist could be so poorly showcased.The plot felt like it was spinning in circles, and by the time we reached the final act, I was ready to rate the film a 5 out of 10. But somehow, it just kept getting worse. The ending, in particular, was abysmal-completely illogical and unsatisfying. It seemed to exist only to close off the character's story, but this made no sense given how little had been explored or developed. After only one film, it felt far too soon to wrap up the Joker's journey, especially when this sequel, if you can even call it that, was so limited in scope.The relationship between Harley Quinn and the Joker was barely explored, which was another missed opportunity. I couldn't believe they paid $7 million to cast Lady Gaga, only to waste her talent on poor writing and subpar songs. Everything about this film felt off, and by the end, I was bored and frustrated.In conclusion, despite going in with an open mind and ignoring the negative reviews, I have to agree with them. This movie was a huge disappointment. I highly recommend saving your money and your time. Hopefully, this will be a learning experience for the filmmakers, and they'll deliver something better in the future.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Heres the storyline.Joker escapes the mental institution, gathers his henchmen/followers, (the plot builds, the excitement almost unbearable for the thrills and spills to come) and Joker becomes a serious nuisance to Gotham city. Just as he is gathering serious momentum robbing banks grabbing power murder mayhem etc. Etc. Harley Quinn blah blah blah, the Joker gets on Batman's radar and the movie ends. What a sequel.Here's the spoiler. None of that happened at all. Instead, the clown decides while in court on trial for his crimes that he hates being the joker and rather be a normal person. It's a serious crock of trash and leaves me wondering who wrote this and what was poor Joaquin thinking for letting this fly?Instead of the Joker 2 I would say this movie is the jokes on all of us. We waited, anticipated, and were robbed. I guess the Joker became a nuisance after all. To all of the fans of the last movie. Ugh.\",\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': 'Joker: Folie à Deux - A False Promise of Depth',\n",
       "    'Review': 'Joker: Folie à Deux is a colossal disappointment. I went in with high hopes, expecting the same intensity and layered storytelling that the original Joker delivered, only to be let down by a film that is, at best, a shallow imitation of its predecessor.The original Joker revived a character that had been flattened by pop culture, turning him back into a complex psychological study that felt both fresh and raw. In contrast, Folie à Deux takes that same character and, despite a runtime of nearly two and a half hours, somehow manages to make him feel more two-dimensional than ever. Even with ample time to develop an intriguing relationship between the two main characters, this film fails to do so, leaving us with a version of Joker that\\'s shockingly dull.Harley Quinn\\'s presence in this film is baffling. She adds nothing of substance to the story, existing solely to prop up Arthur\\'s journey. It\\'s clear the writers wanted to include her as a \"beloved other\" who betrays, but there\\'s no effort to explore her character in any meaningful way. She\\'s reduced to a one-note cliché-further proof that they weren\\'t interested in offering a new perspective on this character who has, like Joker, been overdone by pop culture.And then there\\'s the script. It treats the audience like we\\'re incapable of grasping subtlety, spoon-feeding us every piece of \"nuance\" with clunky exposition. The dialogue is stilted, the premise is hollow, and the film\\'s attempts to recreate scenes from the original are undercut by weak writing that fails to evoke any genuine emotion. It\\'s painfully boring, devoid of tension or intrigue.Now, let\\'s talk about the musical aspect. It\\'s not that the idea of a Joker musical is inherently flawed. The original film drew inspiration from musicals, but this one fails spectacularly to understand what makes musicals meaningful. Good musicals dive into characters\\' inner lives through song, with poetic language that reveals their struggles and motivations. Folie à Deux, however, offers mediocre songs that contribute nothing to character development or the plot. The musical numbers are shallow and pointless, missing the opportunity to convey Arthur\\'s emotions through music.On top of that, the sound design is a mess. The music is excessively loud, and the sound effects are jarring and poorly mixed. There\\'s a moment where Harley applies makeup to Arthur, and the squelchy sound is so out of place it feels almost like a parody. The poor sound quality detracts from any potential impact these scenes might have had.As for the cinematography, it\\'s hit or miss. Some scenes are beautifully shot, with artistic flair that hints at what could have been. But just as many scenes are mediocre, falling short of the original film\\'s visual standards. The movie opens with a promising old-style cartoon animation reminiscent of Looney Tunes, but this clever beginning quickly gives way to a series of disappointments. I initially thought this animation would lead to something clever, but once again, the film treats the audience like a joke.By the halfway point, people around me had given up and were on their phones. For me, it took about 30 minutes to realize this movie was going nowhere. If I had been watching at home, I would have turned it off.In short, Joker: Folie à Deux took a great character and a unique concept and squandered them both. It\\'s a shallow, uninspired mess that fails to understand or respect its audience. Save yourself the time and skip this one.',\n",

This movie was weird and not in a good way.

Picture the Grey\\'s Anatomy singing episode, just not needed and no one asked for it. Felt patched together with the songs and the plot felt so unorganized. The only reason I am giving this movie a 3 is because like the first one, I think the showcase mental illness very well. I thought this with the first movie, Joaquin Phoenix isn\\'t my favorite Joker but the way he portrays him is very thoughtful and I appreciate that. Also Lady Gaga was fine she isn\\'t my favorite actress and I think this felt off. Ranking very low on my Harley Quinn list. Anyway I kept looking at my watch to see when it would end so I would recommend wasting money to see in theaters.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'When the director said he doesn\\'t care about DC or the Joker, it should have been obvious the sequel was going to be bad. Many even speculate he purposely made this one awful to annoy the fans and ruin Joker.So lets start with the good. The movie is shot well. There is no denying that. And thats about all the good I can think of.Now to the bad. And I\\'ll just start with the WORST thing about the movie first. Joker gets KILLED by a random person who then cuts their mouth open to look like Ledgers Joker. Something that was not supposed to happen in respect to Ledgers Joker and legacy. Yep, Joker is killed. Making the whole movie pointless. Even more so then it already was.So what else is bad? Well the movie starts out with the Joker being back to Arthur again. A bumbling guy who feels he\\'s a loser. Despite the first movie changing him around. But this time he\\'s in prison....for the whole movie. Though he escapes more or less and goes right back.Harley is in this, but simply known as Lee. But her story doesn\\'t matter with as at the end she admits she lied to him and put herself in Arkham just to get close to him. And by him I mean Joker, she doesn\\'t care for Arthur.You also only get to see \"Joker\" in dream scenes.Oh... did I mention this is a musical? And not just \"Here are 2-4 songs\". No, most of it is endless musical moments. Sometimes one music number ends and another scene starts, only to start a new musical number. And the songs aren\\'t even all that great and really take you out of this. Making you feel like this is takes places in Lee and Jokers head instead.Heck, this song is more musical then actual musical movies I\\'ve seen.And in general the movie seems to be chaotic and all over. And not in a good way. At least Joaquin\\'s performance is good. Gaga\\'s is somewhere inbetween.Thank goodness my friend paid for my ticket. I\\'d also not rate something a 3 normally. But this was awful. It only got a 3 because it is indeed watchable (so to speak) and was filmed well. BUt thats it. The rest is meant to mock DC fans and Joker fans and crap all over Joker.',\n",

To put in perspective, think of the worst movie from DC? Was it green lantern? Not anymore!If you want to waste some money and 2+ hours in the movie theater, it's perfect for you. There was no mention of Batman, no 2face... sleep and you'll be better off.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker 1 was a refreshingly new take on Joker. Instead of turning him into a cartoon villain, no pun intended, it instead portrayed him as a deeply disturbed individual who was given a very raw deal in life and how that put him into a spiral of violence and madness. This movie had an excellent opportunity to continue this progression and turn him into the diabolical Batman arch-enemy we all know he should be.But instead they made the asinine choice to turn it into a ehr... musical? For me such a choice could be only for one reason and that is to revert the expectations of the original fans and turn this movie into a joke, again no pun intended. Also, ignoring the boring musical parts, the movie just feels pointless. Half of the movie in an insane asylum and the other part in courtroom. Going back and forth trying to explain what he did in the first movie. But for what? We already saw the first movie and many felt it put Arthur Fleck into the path where he transcends his mortal form and become the immortal Joker. But this movie takes a u-turn and turns him back into Arthur Fleck and then ends his path in a brutal fashion.This is a terrible movie which seems to hate its prequel and want to undo it. So I recommend skipping this movie entirely and just re-watch Joker 1 and use your imagination on how he transformed into Joker. Whatever you imagine it will be better than this trash of a movie.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux is perhaps the most textbook example to date of a film being less than the sum of its parts; it dances with very compelling ideas and themes, it bolsters incredible performances by an all-star cast, it is just as hauntingly beautiful in its cinematography as the first film, and the basic story premise is a compelling iteration upon the prior film at first glance. But alas, the ultimate assembly of this sequel in the form of the film we end up watching could not be any more disappointing and misguided. This movie is such a plodding, dull, unengaging, and boring viewing experience that lacks even the most basic fundamentals of cinematic pulse.I am in awe that a film of this scale with so much talent behind it could be squandered so severely. Part of me begins to wander if a superior edit of this film could exist, but it is useless to dwell on such what-ifs when the director himself affirms that this version of the film is his complete vision. An oddly large number of viewers do applaud this film based solely on the merit of what it attempts instead of what it actually achieves; to that, I say, if films were weighed based on their intent instead of their execution, then Tommy Wiseau's The Room would be an objective masterpiece instead of an ironic one.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'I\\'ve never seen a musical in cinemas where the longer it went on, the more you could feel the audience be like \"ugh, another musical number???\" I think part of why these musical parts fall so flat is that they really add nothing. Traditional musicals use the songs to progress the plot and keep the story moving, the songs in this film just paused the movie like an irritating commercial break.The first movie resonated a bit too powerfully with the most dangerous segment of humankind, historically. The main message was one of revolution: subvert the dominant paradigm, kill the rich. But there was also an incredibly poignant affirmation for sufferers of trauma, especially that suffered by the movie\\'s protagonist, and all too real and common in our society even if massively under-acknowledged.I believe (and as always I must add that I could be wrong), that the studio execs, themselves somewhat wealthy, but especially pressured by the owners of capital who finance those studios (and nearly everything else), compelled a formerly unremarkable and less-than well-established director to disempower the sequel by rendering it a boring yet confusing musical inanity with the intention of at least capping the momentum of revolution and the empowerment of solidarity felt by the disenfranchised outcast represented by the Joker character in the first film.Serious question: who is this made for? I can\\'t see comic book fans, Lady Gaga fans, or even fans of the first movie liking this.',\n",

And not just any musical, but one that hijacks the plot halfway through, leaving you wondering if you walked into the wrong movie. Yes, some of the songs were catchy, but the strong plot from the first half takes a nosedive right when the singing starts. It\\'s like the film loses its way, trading tension and depth for showy dance numbers.Joaquin Phoenix, bless his soul, gives another outstanding performance as Arthur Fleck, showing consistency with the first film, even as the writing lets him down. But no amount of brooding intensity can save a character from poor writing and an overlong runtime. Lady Gaga? She was good, but with so little screen time, she never quite gets the chance to fully shine. It\\'s like they brought her in, had her belt out a couple of songs, and then decided to sideline her.And let\\'s talk about pacing. If the first half of the film has you intrigued, the second half might just have you falling asleep. This movie is unnecessarily long, stretching its thin plot to painful lengths. But, hey, at least the cinematography is gorgeous, right? The dark, haunting visuals and metaphors are almost enough to make you forgive the messy story. Almost.In the end, *Folie à Deux* is a muddled blend of musical missteps and slow pacing. Watch it at home if you must, but don\\'t waste your money on a theater ticket. After sitting through two-plus hours of this, I couldn\\'t help but think, \"At this point, we\\'re the clowns.\" But hey, you get what you deserve.',\n",

You had me interested in the trial of the joker, but it was still slow. I needed an epic conclusion to make up for the lack of action in the film. The only time the joker has a violent outburst is in his musical fantasies. Unlike the first film where the joker is on a murderous rampage. You know. Like the crazy clown he is.I'm so seriously disappointed in this movie and especially its lack of satisfying ending. The movie just ends.

       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is the highly anticipated sequel to the critically acclaimed \"Joker\" (2019), directed by Todd Phillips. This film continues the story of one of the most iconic villains in comic book history, delving deeper into the psyche of its central character while exploring new themes and narratives.One of the standout features of \"Folie à Deux\" is its ambitious approach to storytelling. However, in my opinion, the plot feels underdeveloped; it remains in the background and fails to be either solid or particularly engaging. While the film expands on the psychological complexity, the end result does not fully capture attention as one might expect.Visually, the film maintains the striking aesthetic that characterized its predecessor. The work of cinematographer Lawrence Sher, combined with Phillips\\' direction, creates a dark and immersive atmosphere that enhances the emotional weight of the narrative. However, another aspect that negatively impacted my experience is the presence of musical elements. The stylistic shift from the first \"Joker\" is too evident, and these musical moments feel too abrupt and, at times, irritating.The performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga are consistently top-notch and undoubtedly represent a strong point of the film. Phoenix, reprising his iconic role, delivers a complex mix of vulnerability and intensity, while Gaga adds a new dimension to the story. Despite this, I feel the film is a missed opportunity; the performances of the two actors, while excellent, cannot support a plot that, in my view, fails to shine as it should.In summary, \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" positions itself as a thought-provoking exploration of its characters and the societal constructs surrounding them, but not without flaws. With its strong thematic elements and captivating performances, the film is poised to engage both fans of the original and newcomers, though I personally found it less compelling. While maintaining the profound psychological intensity of its predecessor, this sequel promises to take the story in new and unexpected directions, but it may not meet everyone\\'s expectations.',\n",

This is one of the most terrible movies I have ever seen.What is more frustrating is that there was an idea here for a fantastic movie. It seems as though someone (or someones) behind the scenes had an awful idea and injected it into the great idea.What we got was the portrait of a pathertic broken person who completely gave up on everything in a meandering mess of a script. What we should have got was a sensationalizaed mockery of the justice system. The 'Joke' was for him to play the people of the city against each other (those who see him as a monster and those who see him as a hero). We get glimpses of this in the film. Instead of being pathetic in the closing statements, this was the moment where he makes the call to action, and the inmates murder all the guards, breaking out. The bomb goes off, and he gets in the car, and stays in the car, smiling and laughing. He now has an army of Joker faces who are going to burn the city down. Harley stays at his side.Otherwise it just needs a lot of polish. There was only one musical number (The Joker song) that had any kind of effort put into it. Nothing else is even enough to quality as a song. The film also needed to dispense with any occassions that lean too hard into (censored) the Joker character, marginally or literally. To keep us guessing at his game a bit is good, so the Arthur character was done well in the first 15 minutes, when he is quiet and a bit meek, but not well when we see him actually confront 'Lee' about lying. He needs to have known she was lying, ... which is what he meant when he told the lawyer, 'You don't get it'. The perception of him not knowing she was lying is how she helps him. Showing us that he didn't know, is what breaks him from being powerful to being a portrayed as a pawn.\",\n",

The only thing that had me on the edge of my seat was the unrewarded anticipation of the actual Joker's arrival. The character that is capable of unfathomable cruelty and maniacal ingenious is not present in this film.. Sad outing for one of the greatest. The biggest let down is that feature films for these type of characters are rarely produced, so to have wasted the opportunity is nothing but heartbreaking. Now that all the Joker character disappointment is assessed I will say the music, cinematography, and acting are top notch which can be expected from such a talented team.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux is a sequel that did not need to exist. It falls flat as a musical, as a courtroom drama, as a romance, and as a character piece. It's the rare film that is both weird and boring, to a degree that it's hard to imagine anyone enjoying it. Even if the movie's ambitions are admirable, you might end up too bored to care. Very little happens beyond those walls, reducing the film to cramped psychodrama. It's startlingly dull, a pointless procedural that seems to disdain its audience. If the principal actors weren't so watchable, the movie would be an outright bore.My Rating : 3/10.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Despite the anticipation surrounding Joker: Folie à Deux, the sequel falls flat on nearly every level. Where the original film captivated audiences with its gritty realism and compelling character study, this installment feels like a hollow attempt to recapture that magic.The decision to incorporate musical elements was baffling. Instead of adding depth to Arthur Fleck's fractured psyche, the sudden shifts into musical sequences feel jarring and out of place, detracting from the tension and atmosphere that defined the first film. Rather than serving as an artistic expression of his descent into madness, the choreography and singing come off as a disjointed spectacle that undermines the dark tone.Overall, Joker: Folie à Deux feels like a disappointing follow-up that tries to push boundaries but ends up lost in its own ambition. It's a film that confuses spectacle for substance and risks diluting the impact of the original by stretching a character study into something it was never meant to be: a spectacle of chaotic musical numbers and shallow melodrama.\",\n",

And it was a completed whole story, with the question in mind, that we are not sure what was real in the story and what was pure imagination.Now the sequel goes against most things we loved in the first movie.First i didnt belive the same director made both of them, it felt like it was made by a different person who didnt really cared about the first movie.It destroyed the mistery from the first movie by revealing what was real and what wasnt. The story was the re-telling of the first one with the side story of joker finding love. The plot went nowhere, and it ended there with no build up.His only character development was when he stood up to himself in court but that didnt lasted long and went back to the state, the movie began with.Maybe I'm not the biggest fan of musicals, but turning the movie this way was unnecessary. Most of the musical numbers didnt serve as a tool of storytellig, and felt out of place when they began.I have nothing agains Lady Gaga's singing, but during those scenes I didnt see Harley or anyone other in her performance, I just saw Lady Gaga herself. And if she had a different makeup and a different name nobody would have guessed that she is supposed to be Harley Quinn.I mentioned a lots of bad things so lets move on the parts i enjoyed. The cinematography and the lighting was anmazing, it had the same quality as the first movie, and the same goes for the soundtrack for the non musical scenes. The animated opening scene was clever, but I'm sad, it didnt really connected to the plot.Those feautres were wisely kept. The actors performances were great, but the script they had to follow couldnt be helped.Its sad to see the legacy of the first movie turned into this.Like I said that movie was a whole on its own and never needed a sequel.\",\n",

The character had infinite ways it could have strived, but instead it was a let down. Meaningless laughter, no gore, barely any violence, even Arkham prison/hospital is shown as a not too bad place, except for some guard brutality..

Instead of delivering the depth expected from a Joker movie, it felt more like a musical. It was a major letdown for Joker fans. They utterly dismantled the Joker character. The story was directionless and felt meaningless. Throughout the movie, I kept waiting for something to happen that would redeem the terrible plot, but nothing ever did. It left me deeply disappointed.The REAL JOKER character holds so much potential for deeper exploration. There are countless incredible films that could be made based on his complex life. Unfortunately, this film seemed more focused on profit, which led to its downfall. They reduced Joker to a filthy, pathetic man whose only hope lies in seeking sex and attention, and they dared to call that love. Seriously?!That said, Joaquin Phoenix's performance was outstanding, particularly in certain scenes, but even his brilliance couldn't save this film. At times, the music gave me goosebumps, just like in the first Joker movie, but it wasn't enough to redeem the overall experience.As for Lady Gaga's portrayal of Harley Quinn, her costume didn't really capture the essence of the character. Her acting was decent, but nothing memorable or particularly special.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Watched the movie on the 5th of October. Unfortunately i have to agree with most of the comments. A sequel should follow up and respect the first movie. The first movie strongly addressed serious social issues like access to public health, wealth inequality, bullying, mental illnesses e.t.c. That created a fantastic atmosphere where Joaquin absolutely thrived with one the best performances i've ever seen in my life. As to the second movie, i was initially open to Gaga's musical approach to enhance the emotions but this was just too much (please stop reading a listen to a song ;). It just suppressed everything, as well as Joaquin. After almost every single sentence you would get a music break that did not leave any room for the actors, even Gaga (please stop reading a listen to a song ;). One of my best parts of the movie was at the court with Leigh Gill's testimony (also great actor btw). I think one of the few scenes that music did not ruin it (please stop reading a listen to a song ; , now you get my point).Many things to write but i will just conclude with the following. Why would you make such a long movie and leave just 5-10 minutes for the end where the drama should escalate? What did the guards do, why did he break in 3 mins? Did he actually die? Was this movie a long trailer for the next one?Unfortunately i would not suggest people to go and watch it in theaters. Batman/Joker universe is simply not La La Land.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Okay, so I'm gonna get this straight, I never was particularly fond of this iteration of the Joker. Mostly because I'm a huge comic nerd and I can tell that the first movie wasn't so much of a deconstruction of the Joker character, but more so the exploration of a mentally ill man who just happens to refer to himself eventually as the Joker. Arthur Fleck is a deviation of the typical character and it's clear the Joker name was slapped on to get butts into seats. Beyond the name, it takes a lot of element from works evocative of Scorsese and smashes them down into a surprisingly basic and even somewhat generic story about someone falling into mental illness. Phoenix's performance is really what elevates the first film.That being said, at least they tried something here. Not only is Phoenix's performance and Ladu Gaga's vocals the only saving grace, there are far more glaring flaws this time around. The pacing feels absolutely mishandled, Lady Gaga's performance(and her overall character as Harley Quinn) falls extremely flat, albeit Gaga can sing her heart out. The film feels extremely contrived, ESPECIALLY towards the conclusion(for those who seen it, they know what I'm talking about) and for as much as the first movie tries to raise some decent talking points with some cohesion, this sequel in comparison feels like it isn't sure what it's trying to convey. So much potential, but the execution leaves so much to be desired. Not what I would've wanted after waiting five years for a follow-up on Arthur's story, but ultimately not shocked. Once I heard about it being a musical and Lady Gaga(excellent singer but mediocre actress) being the lead, my optimism flew out the window. The irony is that like the first movie, the title is meant to attract audiences and as you can tell from Gaga's casting, they were really trying to pull out the stops this time. But I have a gut feeling this sequel is not going to have the same impact on any level like it's predecessor did. 3 out of 10. Can't rate this any higher.\",\n",

And did every song have to be a terrible song? And it pains me to say this but that phoenix actor gets so immersed in his roles that I become depressed thinking that this is who he is in real life. He was once a cute kid and now just a medium aged moderately good actor who destroyed his body for the craft. Now - the movie: I was so bored with this film that I slept through some of it. There was no storyline to follow and it never developed that or a character until the credits rolled and then I was just happy it was over.

Chances are, they had to do multiple takes with each performer smoking a pack and a half to nail the scene...This felt like an obligation movie. Like Writer/Director Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix were contractedly (and very begrudgingly) HAD to do a follow-up to their Oscar-winning/billion-dollar original. \"Fine, since you\\'re gonna make us do this, let\\'s ruin it by making it a musical\" I could hear them say.Also, this felt like it could work either way. It could be brilliant by making the sequel into a musical or the musical scenes could bring down the whole movie. Spoiler: it\\'s the latter.I could see maybe ONE fantasy scene play out with a song and dance on an obvious soundstage. Maybe two. Most of the movie, it didn\\'t work. And neither did their voices.I love Lady Gaga and her music. Not this time. She was awful. And maybe Phoenix isn\\'t a born singer. I almost want to give him the benefit of the doubt since again, it felt like he was trying to sabotage the film. He was even worse with his voice.What did work for me was the transition from depressed clown to slowly getting a smile on his face due to the introduction of Gaga\\'s Harley Quinn. I pretty much loved watching that spark grow. While this was nowhere at all entertaining as the entirety of the first movie, at least that was something to grasp onto during this disaster.Can\\'t wait to hear someone ask if you needed to see the 2019\\'s Joker. Well, you should anyways because that was 10x better. But, necessary? Not sure. They bring that movie up and its events as much as you see someone light up a cigarette. Again, that\\'s every scene.So, if you were to take away the musical segments, the smoking and the references to Part One, this would be 22 minutes, max. What would be left is those awesome character developing scenes of Joker getting life back into his chuckles.It\\'s easy to hate on this movie for making the daring, albeit terrible, choice of switching subgenres and making this a musical out of nowhere. If the songs were good, memorable or were sung well, I could easily forgive this decision. I left the theatre roughly 60 minutes ago and I can remember one line from one of the songs: I am that Joker, or something like that. Okay, I guess all songs/segments were pretty forgettable.I definitely praised Phoenix for his take on the Joker in #1. While he was still only my third favorite live-action take (Heath Ledger will remain my #1 and Jack Nicholson\\'s a solid second place,) Gaga\\'s Harley Quinn was meh. I will ALWAYS prefer Margot Robbie\\'s version. I understand this version and that doesn\\'t make it great.Was this a waste of time? Did I try and cancel my tickets all week? Is this a worthy follow-up to that fantastic first movie?Why yes, yes and no. Skip it.***Final Thoughts: I will give this movie\\'s opening a total thumbs up. I\\'m not sure why THAT wasn\\'t the whole movie. I mean, if they could ruin the first by making this a bad musical, they could\\'ve certainly go all-in with that very fun opening.',\n",

While Phoenix and Gaga certainly seemed to play their parts well, there was not enough character development and the plot seemed to go nowhere. Just endless musical numbers that didn't enhance the film. In the comics Harley Quinn is Joker's sidekick, but in this film, she's just a user girlfriend with a weird attraction to the joker alter ego. It wasn't believable.Then we see Joker getting shanked in prison in the end and recaptured? Didn't make sense. How doesn't he escape from that one?Overall, the film was a disappointment. Definitely not as good as the first joker movie and it didn't leave from for a 3rd movie to correct any mistakes in the plot. It was a suicidal movie.And being a batman movie, you would expect at some point for batman to enter into the series. There was none in Joker 1 - and I get the plot - a study in psychological madness. But Joker 2 had no need for it.The trailers showed scenes from Joker's fantasy of killing the judge and court members which made you believe in the real film this is how he escapes. Not so.... so it was misleading, in a bad way.Ok - Gaga can sing, she also put on a strong performance, but her character was just weird and not in a crazy way the comics depict. In the end, her character does not advance Joker's story.A few musical numbers were ok, but it didn't do much for the story. Then we hear all these old pop rock tunes in various other scenes which seemed so disjointed.A poor script. Ok acting, weird insertion of music.A film that really isn't worth seeing.\",\n",

After seeing it today, it is battling Last Jedi for worst movie of all time.What a miserable film. It's basically watching a guy get treated terribly by everyone and I mean everyone. This film tries to punish him for his crimes to the point where the film itself is punishing him. It's like taking your least favorite toy and giving it nothing because you somehow hate it so much.The previews never advertise that it's a musical. Anything that resembles a musical is shown them on stage but nothing that will help you to that conclusion. I mean, I heard people walking out of the theater that they didn't know it was a musical.Some of these musical numbers are hit and miss, mostly miss and thankfully they are mostly performed in Joker's head. However, I start to realize the lack of story and these musical numbers are not only out of place and unnecessary, they are merely there to pad out the runtime.As usual, The Phoenix Brother delivered well for his 50 million dollar paycheck along with Lady Gaga. Brenden Gleason as the warden is also wonderful. The movie was also shot well. These are the only positives I can think of that kept me from scoring this film a one.It's just that it felt like a film that simply exists because the studio wanted another sequel this creating a Matrix Resurrections effect where everyone involved was either to spiteful to make this or too fearful of its target audience.\",\n",

If only you all could hear literally EVERYONE'S reaction at the end of the movie... save your money and time, just wait till it comes out on Netflix or something if you want to watch it, you aren't missing anything. The only reason I even gave 3 stars were because the actors, not the movie! I won't spoil it for everyone who hasn't seen it but please do yourself and all of us a favor and DO NOT try to make a follow up, a comeback, a series, anything! Unless you read every review before mine and after, take it into account and start over but firstly with a new director and writing team! Waste of a movie budget.\",\n",

The story was just not there not a lot happens in the movie it's really missing everything that the first movie had as I re watched the first movie before watching this one and it's missing that suspense and all the little hints to Batman that was so well done in the first movie. It just feels like you've not watched a joker movie instead a love story between two prisoners. But by far the worst thing about it is that the movie is that it a musical it just makes no sense on why it was a musical and there is just way too many songs and only a couple make sense. And the end is so disappointing it's almost as bad as if they said it was all a dream but we could all see what was going to happen to him before so there was no big surprise. But there is something positives in the movie the acting is very good . But the movie did not live up to my expectations very disappointed.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"This might be one of the hardest movie reviews I've written. I was shocked when every review for Joker: Folie à Deux came out negative, but after seeing it, I can understand why-especially when it comes to the ending.To start, every other part of this sequel is decent, although it's a bit of a departure, taking on the feel of a love story musical. While Joaquin Phoenix delivers a compelling performance, and Lady Gaga might just be the best Harley Quinn I've ever seen, the movie's heavy emphasis on dreamlike, musical sequences between Phoenix and Gaga caught a lot of people off guard. They spend a significant part of the film singing to each other, creating a surreal and often romantic atmosphere that's not what many fans were expecting.But while I didn't mind the musical direction, the film's real downfall lies in its brutal ending. Without giving anything away, it's extremely graphic and feels so unnecessarily gruesome that it leaves a bad taste after an otherwise decent experience. It's uncomfortable to watch and definitely not suitable for younger viewers.If you're planning to see Joker: Folie à Deux, go in with an open mind. There's a lot to appreciate, especially in the acting and musical approach, but prepare yourself-the ending is intense and could be off-putting for some.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I felt completely mocked after watching this movie. It was a total waste of time, more like a Disney cartoon than a serious film. Instead of delivering the depth expected from a Joker movie, it felt more like a musical. It was a major letdown for Joker fans. They utterly dismantled the Joker character. The story was directionless and felt meaningless. Throughout the movie, I kept waiting for something to happen that would redeem the terrible plot, but nothing ever did. It left me deeply disappointed.The REAL JOKER holds so much potential for deeper exploration. There are countless incredible films that could be made based on his complex character. Unfortunately, this film seemed more focused on profit, which led to its downfall. They reduced Joker to a filthy, pathetic man whose only hope lies in seeking sex and attention, and they dared to call that love. Seriously?!That said, Joaquin Phoenix's performance was outstanding, particularly in certain scenes, but even his brilliance couldn't save this film. At times, the music gave me goosebumps, just like in the first Joker movie, but it wasn't enough to redeem the overall experience.As for Lady Gaga's portrayal of Harley Quinn, her costume didn't really capture the essence of the character. Her acting was decent, but nothing memorable or particularly special.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Just because Gaga is a cast member doesn\\'t mean it has to be a musical. Whomever thought musical numbers was a good idea, it wasn\\'t.Phoenix stayed true to his original portrayal of Arthur Fleck. However, I feel he was let down by poor writing and storytelling in this movie.If the concept was to remove the \\'Joker\\' title from Fleck so that it could be passed on to someone else then this could have been achieved with his death in the first film. We didn\\'t need to sit through that drivel to only kill Fleck at the end and pan out.Harley Quinn was a poor choice, as a supporting character and in terms of actor selection. For anyone who grew up watching the tv shows/movies or even reading the comics, the writers of this movie tried to switch the characters. It was agony to watch.I feel that this is a movie that if you criticize it; you will be hit with \"ah you just don get it\" or \"you don\\'t understand the hidden meaning\"...........Fair enough, but it\\'s hard to appreciate any story telling when Gaga and Phoenix are croaking their way through 50% of that z-rated broadway show.The original Joker was absolutely stunning. A fantastic and artistic portrayal of a person\\'s decent into madness as a consequence of their environment. This falls so so so short of its predecessor. It pains me to score this movie so low. I wanted to love it so badly.',\n",

The director, in order to explain the nature of the Joker, ended up massacring one of the greatest characters ever seen in popular culture. Officially, from now on, the Joker is nothing more than a pathetic weakling who admits that he should have listened to the system. The character of the Joker as we know it after this film seems to have gone forever. Too bad.Anyway, the actors did a great job. Considering her lifestyle, Lady Gaga fits the character of Harvey very well. I think that all the burden of failure unfortunately lies on the director's back.\",\n",

This film is trying desperately hard to be clever and I'm sure there'll be people trying desperately hard to be thought of as clever who will spend pages explaining why it is, but it just isn't.It's an opportunity wasted and the only reason to not leave the cinema is Phoenix's immense acting talent that at least makes the character believable.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker Folie à Deux is a prime example of how a highly anticipated sequel can fall drastically short of expectations. While the film boasts impressive performances and a commendable musical score, it ultimately fails to deliver a coherent and engaging narrative.The Good (and it\\'s mildly good)Lady Gaga delivers a standout performance, showcasing her versatility as an actressThe musical elements are well-executed and add a unique flavor to the filmThe overall production value and cinematography are of high qualityThe Bad (and it\\'s really bad)The plot feels disjointed and lacks a clear directionThe film strays too far from the source, feeling more like a bait-and-switch than a true Joker storyThe movie feels like a missed opportunity. Instead of delving deeper into the Joker\\'s psyche while following the arc of the known story (for example how the Joker becomes more and more the known sociopath who perpetrates crime on a mass level) the film opts for a confusing and ultimately unsatisfying direction. It\\'s as if the creators used the Joker\\'s name solely for marketing purposes, much like the infamous \"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.\" The film\\'s departure from the established Joker lore is particularly frustrating. Fans hoping for an exploration of the character\\'s complex psychology and backstory will be sorely disappointed. What could have been a fascinating character study instead feels like a hollow travesty. While the musical aspects and performances are praiseworthy, they\\'re not enough to salvage the film\\'s fundamental flaws. It\\'s a shame to see such talent and potential squandered on a lackluster script and misguided creative decisions. Save your time and money for a more worthwhile cinematic experience.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"I came into this film expecting the reviews to be wrong. The first film was an excellent description of the joker and his complex mind and I felt that the producers could live up to the climax of maintaining the quality of the old film but even build on it and make it better.However after a dragged out 2 hours and 18 minutes,which could have been shortened by a lot, I realised that the film was a no going col-de-\\nsac of pointless songs and pointless characters. The role of Harley Quinn was portrayed and poorly played by lady gaga. The highly rated actor Joaquin Phoenix followed a poorly written script which although he played well it ultimately led to a poor film which I would not recommend.In conclusion I felt this film was a poor sequel due to the fact that Turning a film about a phychotic lunatic which made a great first film into a musical which went nowhere and proved to be heavily disappointing should never have been done to the joker series. Even though the joker is a laughing lunatic he does not sing his heart out in a film about him as the two films have parallel opposite genres which I feel shouldn't be done\\nI would not recommend this film for any Joker lovers who expect this to be good and also cannot stress enough to people to not go into this movie expecting it to be good as it will be drastically disappointing to you.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'The film could have shown Arthur dealing with his actions as Joker and come to terms if that was really him or not. Certain parts of the movie focus this, but it\\'s ultimately overshadowed by the toxic dependent relationship he develops with Harely and musical sequences. His laughing illness appears throughout the film, but it\\'s never in an abrupt \"gets in the way of dialogue\" sense, which isn\\'t realistic because it happens randomly, not when it\\'s only convenient for the movie.The film ends with the security guards getting away with their mistreatment of Arthur and other mentally ill people, the Joker supporters abandon him once he acknowledges the truth that he really isn\\'t Joker, and he dies rather unceremoniously without any hit of a successor.There were hits of potential Kino like the first film, such as introducing Harvey Dent, and the mixed abused yet somewhat friendly relations with the security guards, and certain parts of the film where singing/music made sense. Unfortunately, this is not the Sequel people wanted for Joker and could have maybe worked if it was under a different name and characters, but they butchered the Joker character for an \"artistic\" film.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Let me start by saying that I am huge fan of musicals. Love them. Seen too many to count. Even I found this musical dull and boring. I genuinely found myself groaning every time a song started.The songs are mostly obscure old Hollywood musical songs and I only even recognized a couple of them, which is only part of the issue with the music. Every time the characters start singing, the story stops dead in its tracks. The songs do nothing to progress the plot like a good musical number should.It's also a total betrayal of the character of Joker. Not sure what went on behind the scenes, but this is not what you'd want as a follow up to a billion dollar, Oscar winning film. I'd be surprised if this gets many nominations outside of the Razzies. There are moments of brilliance. And then nothing happens with those threads.Lady Gaga was supposed to be the standout in this movie and I'd argue she still is. She is given very little to do and still does an amazing job. Her singing is as good as you'd expect. I'd love to see the rest of her scenes that have clearly been cut. (I saw the set photos. We're for sure missing several scenes.) It's hard to tell how well everybody else is doing when the story is so weak and the songs aren't there either.In summary, if you're looking for a courtroom musical drama, go watch Chicago. It's far better and the musical numbers are still amazing to this day.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker 2 revolves around the viewer getting an expanded look, into Arthur's disturbed an broken mind, while being incarcerated in prison, convicted of the five murders, we saw in the previous film.It's not often I go to the theatre to watch a film, but I found it fitting to go watch this, as the last time I went to the theatre was to watch the first one.I had beforehand decided to not watch any trailers and read as few reviews as I possible could, so I could get the full experience and not come in with an expectation.In hindsight I now wish I actually had, so I could have saved myself the $60 the two tickets cost.The film has issues - many issues.The first and probably the most obvious one, is the artistic detour the writers, producers and Todd Phillips in the direction chair took.I'm baffled about the how and why they decided it was a good idea, to turn the now franchise into a musical. And at that point, not even a great one. While I can see it was an attempt to capture Arthur's broken mind, it could have been done in so many other ways, which could have worded a lot better.What we were presented with, is a prolonged Lady Gaga Music Video.The character development is lazy and quite frankly both Arthur and Lee come off as terribly boring. Lee barely has much to say in the film, and the lines she does have doesn't really offer much to the development of the characters over all.When it comes to Arthur, there is very little of him left in him. While I can accept that as a starting point of the film, had it revolved in him going back to his prime time as the Joker, it just never happened. Through out the film, we are met by the same empty and boring character with none to very little development.When Arthur finally has the chance to shine, it's like seeing a totally different person, besides Arthur or the Joker.When it comes to the story and the setting, the movie lacks a lot of the gritty setting and suspension the first film had. In many ways what we were left with was boring and I sat through out the film waiting for something to happen, that just never came.There was way too many artistic freedoms taken in this film and I don't really find many of them a work of a genius.For now, I shall forget this movie exist and just enjoy, that we at least have the first one and it actually details Arthur's descending into The Joker.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"The movie jumps from being a fantastic dissection and continuation of the first movie... To a truly tone-deaf musical which completely destroys the dark and sombre tones built by the rest of the plot.I understand the intention of using the musical scenes as a motif for Arthur's further descent into psychosis, but they feel so out of place that they mostly serve to break the immersion of the audience.The decision for the sequel to a dark, gritty, and depressing psychological thriller about a mentally ill man (and the society that failed to care for him, though the second never addressed this to the same degree as the first) to feature energetic big band musical sequences is so truly BAFFLING to me.I can't help but be frustrated by this movie. It feels like every time I was invested in a scene, the tension that was carefully built was immediately trainwrecked as Phoenix or Gaga spontaneously broke out into song, and I feel like hurling the closest object at the screen out of annoyance as I'm immediately brought out of Arthur's plight.I wish we could've seen this movie without these scenes.\",\n",

Shame as felt it did have a lot of potential. If it was pitched as part Two of a trilogy then even that would've made sense and I could've accepted the movie for what it was but the end for me it was a big failure.\",\n",

But this sequel? They turned it into a ridiculous musical. There are pointless singing scenes that don't fit with Joker's character at all. Where is the dark chaos we expected? Arthur, who was once smart and terrifying, now just feels lost and confused. It's like they forgot what made the first movie so powerful.Also, why mention Batman as a kid in the first movie if you're not even going to continue that story? It felt like such a missed opportunity to build up something interesting. They could have shown more of Joker's impact on Gotham or explored the complex relationship between Joker and Batman. But instead, we get these random, boring musical numbers that feel out of place.The ending was weak and felt like a letdown. I waited years for this sequel, and it didn't go anywhere. There was no big moment, no smart plot twists. It felt empty and pointless, like they didn't know what to do with the Joker's character anymore. If you loved the first movie for its realism, dark energy, and chaotic genius, this sequel will just leave you angry and disappointed. It's not the story we deserved.\",\n",

It has music in it, but musicals have songs carry a storyline and this movie just recycles some good historical songs that are too concrete and obviously trying to push a flatlining story that you may feel slightly insulted....\\nBy misleading trailers, with scenes that do not even feature in the final movie.AND worst of all, by its title. FOLIE A DEUX implies a shared psychosis, one that usually begins in the psyche of one person, able to pull into an alternate reality another person (usually less, but still unstable), loosing themselves in each other with complete loss of touch with reality, both feeding from/into the other\\'s psychosis. Not the case here. It is literally the opposite of a Folie A Deux when he asks Harley to speak instead of sing and she quits the relationship. That\\'s actually normal reality. This was Joker: Faux Pas.The whole movie was marketed and set up to expect an early love story moving into an alternate, mutually destructive reality which is inconsistent with what everyone else is experiencing, in the movie and to us as observers. They could have gone so far down that rabbit hole. Scenes of pure psychopathy shared by these two deranged characters and how it affects the reality of everyone else around them. The talent was wasted in a movie that feels like a bridge to an unwanted saga.The musical genre could have been such a harsh contrast to a gory and depraved act led by these two.But instead, we are shown a study in courtroom etiquette and police brutality. The main characters become afterthoughts. And true, every single time you feel like the movie will (finally) turn around and deliver what was promised, it fails again and again.I would call this Hollywood False advertising. It is done frequently, but was not expected and did not need to be the case here. The Writers (also director, but direction was not that bad) thought it clever to decide to show us a plain Joe deranged man who is less deranged than that who THE ACTUAL JOKER will be, which should be the name of the next movie that I will probably watch anyway, cause if I don\\'t watch trash, then what is left?',\n",

In the sequel, he finds a reason to be a free man in the shape of a love interest, but in order to be a free man, he needs to be seen as sane, and if he seems sane, the love interest doesn't care anymore, so poor Arthur finds himself in a crossroad... Are you kidding me? The sequel returns Arthur to being a puppet.But ok, I guess by the end, the message still is don't be a puppet of anyone. Which is only half of the message of the first movie recycled. So no points for originality nor for a complete assignment there.Moving to technical aspects, at least the acting is still great. As for the musical numbers, I thought there were far to many, but in retrospective, given how bad the characters and the story are, I think they are actually a room to breath, but that may be only me.The script can still function, but it's no competition to the one from the first movie.In conclusion, it's a sequel that only tops the original in one aspect (acting) but it's a wreck in all the other aspects.

Unfortunately, other than a few obvious positives, only one thing stands out as being good, and it completely goes against the entire film. The worst thing about the sequel is how bored you are while watching everything that was and anything that could\\'ve been play out in front of you.The opening animation tells us, in Peter Pan fashion, that Arthur Fleck is part himself and part Joker. The rest of the film is tries to answer the question if Joker is schizophrenic or not, ultimately deciding whether he will receive the death penalty for the five murders he committed in the previous movie. Or is it to find out if he\\'s guilty? Surely he doesn\\'t have a chance at being freed. Does he plan on escaping prison? In the meantime he develops a romance with not Harley Quinn. Is this believable? No. But it has to happen to ultimately lead us...who knows. The romance is not believable nor do we know what to believe about it since multiple scenes happen that the movie fails show whether they are reality or just in his head. It\\'s a jumbled mess that Todd Phillips doesn\\'t care about, nor did I.The story, or lack thereof, was directionless. I can certainly extrapolate ideas about what it is trying to say, but it doesn\\'t explore any of these to their extent. They are boring to begin with, then fail to resolve. Sure, it looks good. Some of the acting is fine. But this is to be expected and only serviced me to not go completely insane myself with the meandering story that never evolved until the tedious ending which only serves to not wrap up anything, but proves there was nothing to wrap up other than telling you that the most honest part of the film was the first three minutes.

There was no action, no violence, no arc, no character development, no point, and no reason to have watched it. I'm mad at myself for contributing to its box office.As I got deeper into the movie, I started to think they must be building to something huge and cathartic, but I can't stress enough when reviewing this just how much of literally nothing is going on. If you can imagine Phoenix and Gaga standing in a dim room and singing under their breath to each other, you'll pretty much have the whole experience.I don't know how Todd Phillips' brain works, so I can't say whether my suspicion that he is just messing with the audience is accurate or not. But it definitely feels that way as the movie ploddingly lumbers up to the verge of having something happen, only for it to veer off into monotony.And frankly, even calling it monotonous is a compliment because there's certainly an argument to be made that the movie lacks even a mono-tone. Unless you count deliberate boredom as a tone.If an argument could be made that the last movie really didn't have anything to do with the Joker, this movie settles that issue definitively. You could take any movie, slap the word Joker on it and put some makeup onto the star's face, and it would have just as much claim to being a Joker movie as this does. If you slapped some clown makeup onto Tom Cruise and called the movie Top Gun: The Joker, it would be just as valid.The only reason it got three stars out of me is because everyone is a good actor, doing the best they can with a painful lack of material.\",\n",

Harleen confesses her admiration of Joker to Arthur and how she relates to him the most. This leads to him falling in love with her while his trial begins. Maryanne wants to prove Arthur Fleck as innocent whereas Harleen wants Arthur to embrace Joker completely.

However, the world of Arthur\\'s fantasy and his reality, though filmed well, doesn\\'t really clash together in the way intended. Lady Gaga was born to play Harleen Lee Quinzel but sadly her role is poorly written. Credit goes to Lady Gaga for elevating her character. Joaquin Phoenix continues his act from Joker and though he looked a bit less convincing in the songs, he made it up in the key scenes. It was the messed up final act and that \"climax\", that derailed the film entirely. With a threadbare storyline, it was always going to be an uphill task to match the far superior prequel.',\n",

You are going to be very disappointed, this a comment I keep hearing on reviews and it's not a valid point.Phoenix and Gaga are brilliant in the film.The concept of it being a muscial I do like as it is used to explore Joker's and Harley's mental states, which makes a lot of sense. Even if the jump between songs felt a bit jaring at times, but this didn't take away from the effect they had.For most of the film it felt like a love story, which I wish they kept exploring it. This probably why I had a smile on my face most of the way through.The bad happens when it turns into a court room drama. We literally only get one full scene that is based in reality where Aurthor is the Joker.Then the ONE massive turning point happens that destroys the entire movie. All i'm going to say it involves a shower room and prison gaurds.It destroyed all momentum and took the entire point out of the movie and this version of Joker.It's a shame as I thought the first one was brilliant.

       "    'Review': \"I hesitate to rate this too high or too low, because I found the movie an incredible deep dive into mental illness and delusional thinking, but cannot stand the representation of the characters themselves.The narrative seemed to drive home a message of 'poor' Arthur Fleck (the stalker and murderer) being taken advantage of by an obsessive woman's calculating need for attention, and society's need to see him as the flag bearer for their hate and anger.While interesting, the way the story was told did not leave me with the sense that this was an 'unreliable narrator' lens, instead painting a murderer as someone to be pitied and related to.Regarding the use of the Harley/Joker dynamic as the linchpin for this movie:\\nIn my opinion, the Harley/Joker relationship has always been a calling card for abusive and obsessive relationships, and part of its draw for me was Harley's descent into madness from a relatively sane, innocent or socially acceptable starting point. Through that dynamic, Harley's character was changed by the Joker and her own terrible experiences, from an overly curious and naive psychiatrist to a delusional and obsessive abused sidekick.In this film, Gaga's character didn't seem to have a character arc at all, nor even a depth of character to begin with. 'Lee' felt more like a trope of the 'woman who wants attention' than it did a three dimensional character with deeper motivations.In this movie, Harley (Lee) is a rich bored white girl with a psych degree and a histrionic and narcissistic personality trying to 'make it big' and fulfil her fantasy of being seen by the world through her predatory manipulation of a mentally unwell man, feeding into his fantasies and delusions to bring forth the alter ego of the Joker that she is so obsessed with.While an interesting starting point, her character and motivations quickly fell flat. Her decisions seemed vapid and poorly understood, and while there were hints of deeper motivations of inciting wider chaos, I felt like I was forced to take too much liberty to really grasp this reasoning.Had there been more evidence of her character outside of Fleck it may have allowed me to make sense of her motivations and justify the idea that Fleck was only able to see what he wanted to see in his obsession with her, and vice versa. But instead, all we saw of her was this singular motivation and obsession, without any deeper exploration.Fleck's story is one to pity and relate to: abused by his mother all his life, a loner due to an unfortunate medical condition and poor social skills, delusional as a form of escapism due to trauma, bullied and beaten, and taken advantage of by the world, leading to him eventually getting so beaten down that he snaps and murders half a dozen people due to a break from reality.By contrast, Harley's story was essentially a one dimensional villain: a bored rich girl who becomes obsessed with this Joker character on TV, decides to commit herself to a mental institution so she could meet him, lies to him about who she is in order to make him love her, and baby traps him??, going on to abandon him immediately when she realizes he wasn't going to play the role of Joker any more.This is a story in which a poor incel - who just wants to be loved - was manipulated by a vapid, manipulative, attention seeking woman. Given how the story was told, the Lee/Arthur relationship felt like a retelling of the age old 'it's not my fault - the witch seduced me' narrative, without appropriate context or critical examination on why one might be viewing this through a skewed lens.By the end of the movie, I felt as though the film was less of a deep dive into a dangerous victim mindset as I took from the first movie but is actually an unironic self insert. Instead of being a critical reflection on what drives dangerous people to commit horrific crimes, it felt more like a justification for it, despite Arthur coming to terms with the fact that it was him all along and not some alter ego that committed multiple murders.I really wanted to interpret this film through the lens of an unreliable narrator - when I do, I find myself intrigued with the message it left me regarding how people like Fleck see themselves and the world: self pity and avoidance of accountability, victim mentality, and an underlying 'everyone else is bad and they all deserve it' attitude. But if this was intended to be viewed through Fleck's perspective, the audience is thrown off when shown scenes that Arthur would never have been privy to nor would have likely fantasized about, suggesting instead that the writing itself unironically relates to Arthur Fleck's character and worldview to some degree. Much of the audience is also likely to interpret it this way even if that is not the intent, and given that art is in the eye of the beholder, and that we as a western audience live at a critical and dangerous point in society, I believe I just watched the incel film of the century (the second one).On the bright side, despite hating musicals I found the use of musical numbers as a representation for shared delusional and obsessive thinking deeply satisfying.\",\n",

       "    'Review': '*\"Joker: Folie à Deux\"* may claim to explore the dynamic between Arthur Fleck and Lee, but in reality, it\\'s more of a one-man show. Lee\\'s character, who could have provided a compelling counterbalance, is completely sidelined in the second half as the film descends into an oddly misplaced courtroom drama. Any potential for a rich exploration of their relationship evaporates as the focus shifts back to Arthur\\'s repetitive internal conflict. The film flirts with the idea of duality-whether Arthur\\'s Joker persona is distinct from him-but exhausts the question long before the credits roll.The musical numbers are jarring and contribute little, with many sounding so similar that they only serve to drag the already sluggish narrative. They halt any momentum, leaving viewers unsure whether the film is a romance, a musical, a courtroom drama, or a critique of the justice system. In trying to be all of these things, it ends up being none, lacking any true sense of direction or purpose.Lee\\'s character could have added a fresh dynamic, but the script doesn\\'t give her the space to develop. Instead, she fades into the background, almost as an afterthought. By the end of its bloated runtime, the film leaves viewers questioning why it exists at all. Was it born from the massive success of the 2019 *Joker*? Possibly. But if that\\'s the case, this film takes every opportunity to squander that goodwill.A cast of incredibly talented actors, visually stunning set designs, and an atmospheric score are wasted in a story that has little to say. Todd Phillips seems determined to dismantle everything that made the original Joker compelling, leaving audiences wondering if this sequel\\'s purpose was merely to prove that lightning doesn\\'t strike the same place twice.',\n",

I felt bad for him to work here. Hopefully he got his bag cause he's not the one to blame for this mess.Todd Phillips you created a masterpiece in 2019 and sabotaged it on purpose. You got your pay check and could've at least tried to make a good sequel like a Joker & Harley Bonnie & Clyde movie or something. Joker 2 has no story, no development and gives me nothing for my money. It's one thing to punish Warner, but a horrible thing to do that to the people that actually pays for that. Warner still gets money for that so it makes no sense to f up this movie. I trusted you because of Old School, War Dogs & Joker, but this sequel puts DC's most popular character in the absolute worst spotlight ever and I'll never forgave you for that. Unlike others I don't think the musical aspect was an issue although it haltered the movie and overstretched it to find its pace.Joaquin PhoenixHit and miss actor. Fabulous work in the first movie and the only thing I can here blame him for is saying yes to this terrible movie.Lady Gaga\\nShe's not a good actress for me, but she really tried and was pushing to get something out of this movie. Her character was written off bad as it started.Shame on all of the people who thought it's a great pitch and idea to record in the first place. You all feed the cliche of Hollywood destroying classics.The 3/10 goes out to the camerawork and for all the actors.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker was a great movie. A one-off, almost art-house film that really didn\\'t need a sequel. I suppose you can admire director Todd Phillips for trying something different. It\\'s a prison/courtroom drama with a speck of (bad) romance. Oh, and it\\'s a musical too! It\\'s a bold move... But unfortunately, this uninspiring, tedious disaster of a movie just doesn\\'t work.What\\'s good about it? The performances from the lead and supporting cast are Oscar worthy. Erm, there\\'s also some nice cinematography but that\\'s about it. More scenes with Steve Coogan next time please!What\\'s wrong with it? Oh man, everything! The first movie was about Arthur Fleck\\'s tragic, tormented and disturbing journey of him becoming the Joker. This sequel has Joaquin Phoenix gone back to being Arthur Fleck, moping around in prison, only fantasising about being in full Joker make-up & suit while performing meaningless songs with his new girlfriend, Harley Quinn. Those of you who were expecting a full-on musical will be disappointed. The songs feel like an afterthought that was shoehorned in at the last minute. Maybe the film-makers realised what an absolute turkey this was going to be and thought \\'I know what to do, Lady Gaga can sing! Let\\'s give her some songs and get Joaquin Phoenix to mumble along with her. What a brilliant idea!\\' How about no! This is a terrible idea and it fails miserably. It only slows the pace of this already unentertaining and depressing movie and makes you worry about what dreadful ideas are possibly on the table for \\'The Batman Part II\\'.\"Let\\'s give the people what they want.\"\\nLady Gaga/Harley QuinnWell, it ain\\'t this dull, empty and lifeless monstrosity.

This is the worst movie I\\'ve seen in theaters this year and I\\'ve seen Night Swim. This was just a troll job that was extremely boring and pointless. Lady Gaga was basically a cameo and the musical scenes were completely pointless and offered nothing.Furthermore, of all the endings Phillips could have chosen, he went for the edgy \"Actually, he\\'s not the real Joker\". Felt like a slap in the face of the fans for investing their time into the story. Ending the movie with Arthur getting stabbed to death by a random inmate made the entire thing feel like a waste of time. Just why?More importantly, Joker didn\\'t do anything in the movie. His escape from prison (Lee sets the fire), court explosion, and his escape (not him). All the scene with \"Joker\" are in the dream sequences, so there\\'s no tension, no suspense in the movie.The musical scenes served no purpose and none of the songs were memorable at all, whenever the courtroom scenes were getting slightly interesting it would cut away for a song that would last way too long.Also, Arthur seemingly loses faith in the Joker persona causing him to tank his defense and admit he\\'s guilty in closing statements, yet five minutes later he\\'s excitedly trying to escape with Harley?To be blunt, this movie is a complete disappointment. A bland, pointless epilogue that has nothing new to say or add to the great 2019 film. An apology of sorts for what the first one did, and trolling at its best.In the end, this movie is one of the worst sequels ever made and it\\'s a disgusting insult to the fans of the original film.

Her portraying Harley Queen did just not appear believable. A popstar with one of the most notable voices in the world singing in an asylum choir? She did not have anything crazy about her except for trying to bring the Joker out of Arthur Fleck. Poor casting choice, there would have been so many alternatives. And the singing could have been cut short by almost every song. I strongly hope that the director never gives us a Batman movie, I already have nightmares of the Dark Night dancing like a Ballerina.Fair play to the display of personality disorders.

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux had high expectations following the critically acclaimed original, but unfortunately, this sequel falls short in almost every regard. The film attempts to delve deeper into Arthur Fleck's psyche, but what was once a nuanced exploration of mental illness now feels more like a disjointed, overindulgent spectacle.First and foremost, the inclusion of musical numbers-an unexpected choice-ends up feeling jarring and out of place, disrupting the tone established by its predecessor. What worked for other genre-bending films ends up feeling forced here, as the contrast between Fleck's psychological descent and these surreal scenes is more confusing than compelling. Even with the talents of Lady Gaga, her portrayal of Harley Quinn feels underdeveloped, almost like an afterthought in the script, serving more as a caricature than a fully realized character.The film's pacing is another significant issue. It drags through long, meandering sequences that neither advance the plot nor build tension. While the original Joker was intense and engaging, Folie à Deux struggles to maintain momentum, frequently losing focus with repetitive scenes that try too hard to be provocative without saying anything new.Lastly, Joaquin Phoenix's performance-while still impressive-seems constrained by a script that doesn't know what to do with him. What should have been a deeper dive into his disturbed worldview instead becomes a rehash of the same ideas, leaving the character feeling stagnant and robbed of the complexity that made him compelling in the first place.Overall, Joker: Folie à Deux is a disappointment. It's a film that tries to blend genres and push boundaries but ends up feeling like a chaotic mishmash that's neither gripping nor thought-provoking. Fans of the original will likely be let down by this sequel that fails to justify its existence.\",\n",

The excellent performance of both actors are enough to save it from a total fail in my opinion, but that's in it, nothing else at all. :(\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Let's be honest, the first film was great! A self contained tale about a man who was broken down and incredibly well told and acted! The second only just rehashes what was told in first film and drags on over prison and court scenes dragged over 2 hours and 20 minutes.The musical parts are incredibly misplaced and Lady Gaga was just not great, she was ok but she's not a talented actress and to me was a very strange pick considering the musical side of it is so bad.Pheonix is probably the only redeeming factor of the film and he makes it atleast watchable if your very bored and want to watch Joker in the prison/court and dream sequences that are terrible songs.The good is Pheanix is a brilliant actor and anything he touches is gold. But it's nowhere near the original, skip it unless you really really care.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker: Folie a Deux follows up 2019\\'s The Joker, both directed by Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Phoenix. Where Joker actually had something to say about mental health, health care and the staggering income inequality brought on by possible extreme right wing governance, Joker 2 has nothing to say, about anything.The sequel picks up a couple of years after the events of the first movie, and Arthur Fleck is now imprisoned in Arkham, awaiting trial. While detained he meets \"Leigh\" (Lady Gaga). The second half of the movie then turns into sort of a courtroom proceeding. (No spoilers as ALL of this information is in the marketing and trailers).There is really nothing interesting happening in this movie at all, save for maybe one scene.Also, I have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA where, how or why they spent 200,000,000$ on this movie.As a moderate fan of the first movie, this one just did not do anything for me. The Lady Gaga musical elements are well performed of course though they add nothing to the movie whatsoever.This is a disappointment.',\n",

Some of the songs did make an impact but 80% of the music sequences just felt out of place and really paused any momentum the movie had, which wasn't much.Nothing really happened in this movie, it kind of felt like an unnecessary, added chapter to the end of the first movie, dragged out to a feature length film. I'm not sure who this movie was made for as it definitely wasn't made for the fans of the original movie, but I can't imagine it makes any new fans happy either.Anyone coming for Lady Gaga will be disappointed that she is not used very well or often and her story leads nowhere. Anyone coming for Joker (while an amazing performance by Joaquin Phoenix) will also be disappointed with how his story unfolds as he doesn't have any agency in his own film and he is made out to be the joke of the film.The movie is visually beautiful and the performances by Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix are great, and the movie does have some really funny moments but these are not enough to save the film. I would not watch this movie a second time even though I have watched the first film multiple times.\",\n",

What made the first film so intriguing-the slow descent into madness-was replaced with a frantic, disjointed attempt to outdo its predecessor without any real sense of direction. Fleck's evolution (or lack thereof) feels more like a series of erratic, isolated scenes than a cohesive narrative.The film struggles to find its tone, oscillating between forced social commentary and a carnival of absurdity, leaving neither thought-provoking nor entertaining moments to cling to. It's as if the filmmakers believed that more chaos automatically equals more depth, but instead, it comes off as empty spectacle with none of the philosophical grit that made the original resonate. The character development was shallow, almost as if they hoped we wouldn't notice the lack of story under the avalanche of neon-lit chaos and ominous laughs.Joaquin Phoenix, ever the committed actor, did his best, but even his performance couldn't save a script that feels more like a checklist of provocations than an actual journey. Joker 2 is a poor imitation of its own predecessor, like trying to laugh at the same joke twice-only this time, it falls flat, and you're left wondering why you ever found it funny in the first place.Verdict?

It was filmed with a budget of about $50m USD which is small change in Hollywood.The movie was confronting, violent and disturbing at times. I loved it. I think you could say actually I was a super fan of Joker.I wasn\\'t the only one. Joker premiered at the 76th Venice International Film Festival on August 31, 2019, where it won the Golden Lion, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 4. The film was a box office success and set records for an October release. It grossed over $1 billion, becoming the first R-rated film to do so, and it was the highest-grossing R-rated film until being surpassed by Deadpool & Wolverine in 2024.It was also the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2019. The film received numerous accolades, including two Academy Award wins at the 92nd Academy Awards for Best Actor (Phoenix) and Best Original Score out of 11 nominations including Best Picture, becoming the first DC film to do so.I have been waiting 5 long years to see the sequel. \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" aka \"Joker 2\", was released on October 4, 2024.Joker 2 again features Joaquin Phoenix as Joker, and introduces Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn - Joker\\'s love interest.The reviews have been appalling and after watching it tonight I know why.Joker could have been a multi-billion dollar franchise with 6 or 7 movies. But not anymore.For reasons I cannot explain, Warner Brothers decided to make it a musical. In 135 minutes there is about 30 minutes of musical action, almost none of which adds any value or enjoyment to the movie. It would be a far better movie if you just erased all the musical scenes.There was potential to make this second movie great, it would have been easy. But instead they\\'ve literally blown up the whole franchise.I have walked out of the cinema bewildered. It\\'s like they were dealt a royal flush in poker, and folded without even waiting to see what the other players called....What a massive disappointment.Erase the musical sections and change the ending, and you could easily have another billion dollar hit on your hands...',\n",

While the story of the first movie was told on a surface level, this one tries to be more complex and pushy in its storytelling but the result is somehow emptier than its predecessor. Once again, the cinematography is beautiful and the score is great. Joaquin Phoenix continues to be fantastic as Arthur Fleck and while I respect them trying to dig deeper with his character, it isn't interesting this time around. Lady Gaga is great as Lee Quinzel. However, her character is underwritten and the relationship between her and Joker isn't all that captivating. It doesn't help that there's barely any chemistry between Gaga and Phoenix. The musical sequences are fine but they didn't add anything and they got tiresome after a while. Speaking of things that got tiresome, the courtroom scenes are aimless and go nowhere. This is going to leave audiences divided, baffled, and infuriated (understandably so). As someone who didn't love the first film and had hope for this film, I found this follow-up to be tedious and mostly unneeded even if it has a few interesting moments. Sure, it's well made and acted but it's nothing but a hollow feature. Also, what was that ending? Seriously, it came out of nowhere.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Well, where do I start. I get it, it's good to do something different, and I didn't need a carbon copy of the first movie but going with a complete new theme is always a gamble. Here, it fails dismally. It starts off pretty well, with the Joker in prison. It's dark and brooding and sets up the movie. Unfortunately, it sets up some over the top musical numbers. I've had chance to ponder this and I have a few niggles. It adds absolutely nothing to the story, it is jarring, it stops the flow of the film and worse of all, I'm not even sure the singing star can actually sing. She certainly can't act. It has some decent things going for it; it looks good, pheonix just about gets the right side of pastiche and it has a couple of interesting scenes. Ultimately though, it's a failure of epic proportions.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Or \"the Clown with his pants falling down\".This film had the potential to be memorable, but instead, it seems to be deliberately dull. As the movie itself states, \"All we had was the fantasy\" and they gave up on it. So now, \"we aren\\'t going anywhere\"!I didn\\'t particularly like the original (due to my own expectations and interest in the franchise). Who goes to the theater expecting a realistic, somber tale about one of Batman\\'s most iconic villains detached of its more fantastical elements? But even I could see what the original delivered-Powerful imagery of someone becoming a symbol and an emissary of chaos and change. It had depth, it was a good study on the topics and even a message! But it was never about THE Joker. It was a good movie with a franchise label slapped on so it would sell better.. and it never had the intention to deliver on it\\'s promise. It was clear to me then, and now it seems to be obvious to everyone else now! The negative reactions come as no surprise, as they chose not to follow through on the character and what audiences rightfully expected.This sequel is well-shot, well-cast, and executed according to its own vision. The premise was solid, and the foundation could have been interesting.. but doesn\\'t build upon that, the script and interactions are weak, and leaves the audience without gratification. Instead, it closes the book on the story of a man that just wanted normalcy! And personally, I think it was fine.More than anything, I found Lee Quinzel to be one of the few aspects that echoed the promise of the original. She wanted him to keep the chaos alive. But in the end, there\\'s no grand, satisfying plan. Fantasies may be integral to the character, and she understood what music meant to him (as means of manipulation), but ultimately, they don\\'t help the film.. specially when they interrupt what it little it offers constantly.The unnecessary final \"nod\" at Christopher Nolan\\'s departure from WB is hollow, cheap and insulting. Watch it on streaming.. if at all.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Despite the negative buzz, I decided to see this film on the big screen, hoping to judge it for myself. Like many, I was skeptical about turning the Joker story into a musical, though I was willing to give it a fair shot. Unfortunately, the film falls short in several key areas.The musical aspect, intended to give insight into the Joker's psyche, quickly becomes overdone and tedious. While the songs could have been an interesting way to explore the character's inner world, they focus almost exclusively on the love story between Joker and Harley Quinn, missing an opportunity to delve deeper into his madness. There's one brief moment-10-minutes in a scene (where the Joker also sings about something other than love)- that captures a glimpse of the eccentric madness from the first film. For that short stretch, the movie shows what it could have been, but it ultimately slips back into disappointment.The overuse of scenic shots, an excessive focus on a fictional trial that takes up a third of the movie, and the endless musical numbers make the film feel drawn out. By the end, I was eager for it to finish. Despite my best efforts to play devil's advocate, I left the theater completely aligned with the wave of criticism.The only real highlight is the performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, who fully commit to their roles as Gotham's infamous crime couple. Sadly, even their excellent portrayals couldn't save the film.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Visually, Joker: Folie à Deux is stunning. The cinematography is exceptional, maintaining the gritty and immersive style of the first film. Each frame feels carefully crafted, pulling us deeper into Arthur Fleck\\'s deteriorating mind. The film does a great job of exploring more of Arthur\\'s internal world, focusing on his fantasies and detachment from reality, rather than offering a clear-cut progression of events.However, this is where the film falters somewhat. While I appreciate the deep dive into Arthur\\'s psyche, the narrative itself feels disjointed. The film is essentially a musical, with a song breaking out every other scene, which makes the story feel like it\\'s on pause most of the time. The majority of the film consists of flashbacks, and while the ending is unexpected, leaving you unsure of who deserves punishment and why, it doesn\\'t tie things together as well as I\\'d hoped.The quiet corner scene is a surprising moment that sticks with you, adding to the ambiguity of whether Arthur truly deserves what happens to him. Ultimately, \"Folie à Deux\" offers a mesmerizing visual experience but lacks the coherent narrative punch that the original \"Joker\" delivered so powerfully.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'I wish to preface this review by saying that I really enjoyed the first movie a lot. I would like to think that I\\'m not this incel or bigot that the mainstream media or critics of the original would like you to think I\\'d be and frankly anyone who thought the first movie was going to be this twisted call to action needs to get their egos checked and to touch grass. That said, I can acknowledge that the path Arthur goes down is self-destructive and violent. I don\\'t condone what he did, but I can sympathize with his plight, his downfall into being a martyr for the outcasts and appreciate the nuance the first movie conveyed. It was honestly the perfect standalone title.Unfortunately, the sequel takes everything you loved from the first movie, crumples it up like a piece of tissue paper, spits on it, throws it on the ground and then stomps on it multiple times before throwing it into the trash. Imagine if the victim of bullying who fought back against their tormentors, was scolded for defending themselves, was then forced to apologize to the bullies and the abuse continued as before, that\\'s what watching this movie feels like. On top of it feeling long and too drawn out for my liking.I\\'m being rather hyperbolic, so I will recount what I loved about the movie first before ranting about why it didn\\'t need to exist and is just another product of corporate Hollywood greed.You can tell the budget for this movie has skyrocketed from the original because the cinematography, technical prowess, lighting, colors and overall set design is gorgeous, absolutely breath taking. Each shot highlighted the grim, gritty and morose tone of the movie while also adding in splashes of color, pizazz and shine to the campier musical elements. The way each scene is shot is purposeful and beautiful. You can grasp the 80\\'s inspired look of a grungy Gotham and it passes with flying colors in that regard.Joaquin Phoenix is amazing as the Joker. If there\\'s one thing that carries this movie is his performance. His take on the Joker is interesting, unique and complex, which makes his portrayal stand out a lot more compared to other iterations of the iconic villain. Lady Gaga also does well with what little material she was given. I would argue she\\'s criminally underutilized, but the scenes she was in were great. The acting from the supporting cast was also great too, especially the scenes involving the survivors of Arthur\\'s delusions. The courtroom segment with Puddles is the best part.Aside from that, the rest of the movie fundamentally ruins the first movie and doubles back on what made it so great. It told a story about a mentally ill man who was forgotten by a society that treated him like trash on the side of the road. Despite his crimes, you can somewhat understand why he went down such a dark and harrowing path and in short, the first movie was essentially about those who were disenfranchised and knocked down by a corrupt system they felt powerless against, which is one of the reasons why it was so popular with a lot of people.For starters, this sequel shouldn\\'t exist; it was unnecessary and was only worsened by the fact that it was a musical. As a fan of musicals myself, what we got wasn\\'t awful, the problem with them is that they bloated the run time of the movie and took you out of the seriousness of the more important, dramatic scenes. Musical numbers need to serve a purpose and most of them occur in Arthur\\'s head, meaning it doesn\\'t affect the overall story. Honestly, I feel the only reason it was included in here was because they got Gaga to play Harley and she\\'s an amazing singer. They were pointless and flashy distractions that only served to showcase how barebones and lackluster the story really was. Cut the musical numbers from the film and it\\'d expose how dreadfully short the movie actually was.I appreciated the direction they were attempting to go in, however the message it conveyed was a horrible one. Arthur was a broken man who fought back against a world that treated him terribly and this movie essentially stripped him of that motivation. Harley ends up becoming the manipulative lover in the relationship, because apparently showing a man doing it to a woman is problematic now, even though we\\'re told we\\'re not supposed to like these two, but whatever. Her scenes are pretty few and far between, her dialogue is meaningless word salad, (take a shot every time she mentions \"making a mountain\") and she acts more like a terrible Harley Quinn cosplayer than the actual villain she\\'s based on. In summary, she\\'s basically an overly obsessed true crime fanatic and compulsive liar who likes the idea of Joker rather than Arthur himself. And the minute he gives up the act, she drops him like a bad habit. If this is commentary on the true crime community, then well played, but even then, Quinn was only there to be a plot device and robbed Fleck of any agency he had previously.The first movie was ambiguous and open ended because that was the appeal of the Joker. His character\\'s past is shrouded in mystery and even when he recalls his life story in the first one, you\\'re not even sure if he was being truthful because he\\'s an unreliable narrator. To me, it feels like the director was ashamed of what he made previously and tried to reverse course on all of that.Side note, I\\'m tired of Hollywood elites downplaying superhero comics and saying, \"it\\'s not real art, and these aren\\'t real movies.\" If that was the case, then the MCU wouldn\\'t be as big as it were today. DC comics, the ones who publish Batman and Joker comics, and the character this film is desperately trying to mooch off from wouldn\\'t be as successful had it not used the Joker title to market the film. I\\'m honestly over the snootiness and self-entitlement of rich and famous people downplaying the very things that they profit off of and get awards for. It\\'s like a painter saying that watercolor paintings aren\\'t as good as oil paintings but still using the watercolor medium to create their own artwork despite their protests, it\\'s frankly absurd and childish.On top of that, the film alludes to a very brutal scene where Arthur gets \"a word that rhymes with graped\" and that\\'s what spirals into a mess of an ending where he gets beaten down so badly, loses one of the few connections he has in Harley and escapes from the courtroom, only to get tricked by the evil prison wardens and then killed off at the end by what\\'s shown to be someone who is going to become the real Joker. So, in short, the first movie was a fluke, and this movie tells you that you\\'re a bad person for liking it and the protagonist you were following wasn\\'t the real deal.Overall, this movie while produced excellently was poorly conceived, mishandled in the worst way possible and spiteful to anyone who appreciated the first one. If you like it, more power to you, but even someone like me who gave it a rather generous and somewhat ambivalent opinion of it, can\\'t help but say that it missed the mark in a lot of ways.The only reason this movie existed was because of corporate greed, oversequelization and director\\'s remorse that reeks of being a sore winner. Had this movie\\'s plot been handled differently, I would have eaten it up, but as it stands, this just proves that even with the same team from the first movie, you can\\'t catch lightning in a bottle twice. Best to wait for this to come out on streaming instead of wasting money on a ticket or two like I did.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Arthur Fleck, is now confined to a cold, isolated cell in Arkham asylum after his infamous crimes. His isolation feels endless until Dr. Harleen Quinzel, a psychiatrist with her own dark past, enters his life. Arthur, now fully embracing the Joker persona, speaks to her unresolved memory of watching her father stabbing her mother to death. He reveals that only by surrendering to chaos has he found peace and a sense of true freedom.As Harley listens, her curiosity turns into a dangerous fascination. She's drawn to his unfiltered honesty, the way he speaks about rebellion with a passion that lights up her own repressed darkness. The boundaries she once held firm blur; she becomes promiscuous, losing herself in strangers' arms. Her husband watches helplessly as she spirals-she cuts their children's hair in a grotesque display, tattoos her face, and paints their home in a manic frenzy. When he finally throws her out, she feels nothing but liberation. She is no longer Harleen Quinzel; she is Harley Quinn, Arthur's loyal priestess and the orchestrator of his revolution.Harley organizes protests and rallies, channeling her newfound madness into a growing movement. What begins as a grassroots rebellion against society's cruelty evolves into a full-fledged gang. She becomes the engineer behind the Joker's uprising, transforming the city with her fiery passion.Meanwhile, Arthur's trial looms. The lawyers want to plead insanity, but Arthur refuses-he insists Arthur Fleck is dead. Firing his legal team, he represents himself, bringing the people who failed him to the stand. One by one, he exposes the social worker who abandoned him as a child, the shrink who didn't care, and the show secretary who set up the cruel TV ambush with Murray. The climactic moment arrives when Harley herself takes the stand, declaring their twisted love with a devotion so raw and impassioned that it stuns the courtroom.The jury, moved or manipulated by the Joker's performance, delivers a shocking verdict: not guilty. Arthur walks free, and his victory feels like a triumph for every lost soul in Gotham.Years later, the Joker has become a cultural phenomenon. He runs a controversial podcast, captivating millions with his unapologetic and incendiary rhetoric. He even announces a run for office, his growing base of loyal followers sees him as a messiah. When his political ambitions are mocked and ridiculed, he retreats to the shadows, unleashing his criminal organization in full force. Harley, his ever-loyal queen, stands beside him as they take down corrupt politicians and mobsters, creating a dark legacy that shakes Gotham to its core waiting for his nemesis to come out of the shadows.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'It was expected that the sequel to \"Joker\" would struggle to reach the same depth and impact as the first film. The 2019 original, directed by Todd Phillips and starring Joaquin Phoenix, made waves with its dark, psychological tone, offering a unique take on the villain\\'s origin story. However, in \"Joker: Folie à Deux,\" Phillips seems to have lost his way, delivering a sequel that, while it has some interesting elements, feels disconnected and, at times, soulless.The first thing that stands out is the change in tone. While \"Joker\" explored an oppressive and decaying Gotham through a raw, almost realistic lens, \"Folie à Deux\" mixes elements of musical, courtroom drama, and a touch of fantasy, creating a film that seems undecided about what it wants to be. The inclusion of musical numbers-a bold and, in theory, promising idea-ends up being one of the film\\'s biggest missteps. Instead of organically blending into the narrative, the songs feel like jarring interruptions, flashy distractions that don\\'t really advance the plot or deepen the characters.The relationship between Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) and Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga)-the future Harley Quinn-is one of the central aspects of the story. However, this dynamic, which could have been fascinating and layered, ends up being shallow and predictable. Gaga, who\\'s already proven her talent in films like \"A Star Is Born,\" seems limited by a script that doesn\\'t give her much room to shine. Gaga\\'s Harley is less vibrant and eccentric than the version popularized by Margot Robbie, which could have been an interesting approach if the film knew what to do with this more restrained take. Unfortunately, her character ends up as a shadow of the anti-heroine we know, defined more by her obsession with Arthur than by her own motivations.As for Joaquin Phoenix, always intense and committed to his roles, he tries to bring depth to a character who, in this sequel, feels lost. Arthur is more beaten down, more disillusioned, and the film tries to convey this visually with a gray, oppressive cinematography. The problem is that, no matter how much Phoenix tries, the script doesn\\'t give him much to work with. The lack of clarity about Arthur\\'s intentions and emotional journey makes it hard for the audience to connect with him in a meaningful way. In \"Joker,\" Arthur\\'s arc was clear: a broken man, marginalized by society, slowly descending into madness. Here, that trajectory is muddled, without direction.The biggest problem with \"Folie à Deux,\" however, is the sense that everything is happening out of obligation. The film feels like it was made more out of pressure to continue a successful franchise than out of a genuine creative need. There\\'s a noticeable frustration in how the ideas are executed-it\\'s as if Phillips is trying to make a subversive film but doesn\\'t fully believe in his own choices. The visual and narrative references, which in the first film evoked Scorsese and 70s cinema, here turn into hollow pastiches, lacking the same impact or purpose.And it doesn\\'t help that the film\\'s pacing is sluggish. The long trial of Arthur, which should have been the emotional and narrative core of the plot, ends up being tedious and repetitive. There are moments where it feels like we\\'re stuck in an endless loop of courtroom scenes that go nowhere, while the potential to explore Arthur\\'s mental state-and how it influences his perception of reality-is only superficially touched upon.In the end, \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is more of a missed opportunity than a true continuation. The film tries to be many things at once-musical, psychological drama, social commentary-but doesn\\'t succeed in any of them. The lingering feeling is of a director unsure of what he wants to say or where he wants to take his characters, delivering a film that, despite strong performances and competent production design, ends up being frustrating and disappointing. If the first \"Joker\" was like a love letter to dark, disturbing cinema, \"Folie à Deux\" is like the creative hangover, trying to find its way but tripping over its own ambitions. Which is a shame.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker is one of my all time favorite movies. The emphasis on the mental state of Arthur Fleck, the exploration of his character, the society that mistreated him, and his descent into madness was the most captivating thing I\\'d ever seen. I was so excited for this movie when it was announced and was excited to see the introduction of Harley Quinn\\'s character and I was curious to see how they would use the musical element. What we got was a movie that detracted from everything the first movie stood for. There was no development in Arthur\\'s character as he remained stagnant and did not seem to be any different than how he had acted in the first movie. Joaquin did a fine job with what he was given, but ultimately he was given a bad script. Harley Quinn had no character development and was one of the flattest main characters I\\'ve ever seen. The musical element was executed miserably. The random bursting into song was overused and the music not even impactful. Gaga seemed to also play herself instead of Quinn, and the scene where she quite literally was playing the piano made me think \"Isn\\'t that just Lady Gaga?\" The trial did nothing for the story as well as we just saw Arthur do, quite frankly, goofy things, goof it up, then give up and be murdered shortly thereafter. Oh and he got dumped. Oh and he\\'s apparently not the real Joker? What was this movie even for? What was it supposed to make you feel? What was it supposed to say? I can\\'t even begin to think of what the answers to those questions are except a soulless cash-grab on one of the highest grossing rated R films that challenged society and commented on mental illness and brought a new light on an interesting villain. This sequel did nothing.',\n",

The arc of the characters virtually non-existent. Harley Quinn as a character brings literally nothing to the story, and again, it's not Gaga's fault, it's just terrible writing. No wonder the director decided to say goodbye to the DC universe. 4 stars for the acting and cinematography.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux is a daring sequel that takes the chaotic brilliance of its predecessor and amplifies it with a musical twist. Directed by Todd Phillips, this film once again stars Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, the tormented soul behind the Joker, and introduces Lady Gaga as Harleen Quinzel, better known as Harley Quinn12.Set primarily in Arkham State Hospital, the film explores the deepening madness and twisted romance between Arthur and Harleen. The narrative is both haunting and mesmerizing, with Phoenix delivering a performance that is as intense and unsettling as ever. Lady Gaga's portrayal of Harley Quinn is a revelation, bringing a raw and electrifying energy to the screen.The musical elements are a bold choice, adding a surreal layer to the already complex psychological landscape. The songs are hauntingly beautiful, with Hildur Guðnadóttir's score perfectly complementing the dark and twisted narrative. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher captures the grim atmosphere of Arkham, making the hospital feel like a character in its own right.While the film's pacing can be uneven at times, the performances and the audacious blend of genres make it a compelling watch. It's a film that challenges the boundaries of the superhero genre, offering a deep dive into the psyche of its characters.Verdict: Joker: Folie à Deux is a bold and unsettling sequel that will leave audiences both disturbed and enthralled. It's a must-watch for fans of the original and anyone interested in a unique cinematic experience.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker (2019) is probably not a film for everyone but is among the best modern films. Technically, it is strong in screenplay, acting, cinematography, score, etc. It covers the topic of mental disorder and abuse in a manner where you do not necessarily walk out of the film feeling good. It starts off on a sad note and keeps getting sadder. Then it reaches a point where the Joker fights back in his way. The abusers, rude selfish people, and attackers are put in their place (or in the grave where applicable). In a way, Joker triumphs by presumably connecting with a hidden persona in him.Five years later comes its second part. As someone who appreciated the first film (can be put on a best films list, not necessarily on a favorite film list), I was looking forward to watching it, expecting the film to build up on the first one especially continuing with the tone set in the last 30 or so minutes in the first film. With a budget of $200M, the production values were expected to be high.However, what Todd Phillips presented was just another version of the first film. Everything is basically reset where we see the Joker pitted against another set of abusers. In the matters of love, he is again taken for a ride (though in the first film, his love was imagined). In between, characters from the previous films are thrown in more or less uninteresting court sequences. The difference here is that in this film Joker fails. His abusers, it is implied even rape him, triumph. He is killed (shown bleeding to death) by a person who is supposed to take over the Joker mantle from him. So the question - Is Arthur Fleck not even the Joker that we know?In the end, the film feels phoney, impacting even the narrative and tone in the first film. The sliver linings are the production values and acting. Overall, the film deserves the backlash that it is getting!',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Last night, we watched the movie, and honestly, all I could see was a cowardly character, not the iconic Joker I was expecting. The essence of the Joker as a fearless, unpredictable, and chaotic villain was completely missing. Instead, the character portrayed seemed weak and hesitant, which doesn't align with what makes the Joker such a compelling figure. It felt like the director either misunderstood the character or simply wasn't interested in bringing the true Joker to life. If that was the case, it makes me wonder, why did the director choose to take on the project in the first place? If he wasn't willing or able to capture the true essence of the character, what was the point? The whole experience felt like a missed opportunity, and as a fan of the Joker, it was honestly disappointing.\",\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': 'Mismatch of Audiences is a Failed Experiment',\n",
       "    'Review': 'I don\\'t have any statistics, but it is my hunch that the kind of audience that likes to watch dark and bloody thrillers don\\'t like musicals. Conversely, I would be surprised if people who go to movies like \"La La Land\", would be willing to sit through a tough movie about a killer in prison. The first Joker movie was produced as though it was a Martin Scorsese film, and it was a revelation (see my review). The filmmakers back then had no intention of producing a sequel. While watching the sequel, I analyzed the story structure. Fleck is now in jail and is preparing for trial. That is not enough story to fill a two hour movie. Even with the introduction and pairing up of Joker and Harlequin in this movie, momentum is stunted while Fleck remains in prison.For a more engaging story, all the events that happen later in this film should all be packed into the first act. The story I think audiences wanted was for Joker to break out of prison, begin his crime spree, and witness his transformation into the Joker we all know and love from \"The Dark Knight\".I wonder if the director and screenwriter asked himself \"What would Marty Scorsese do?\". (I suppose he could call him and actually ask him). Well, Mr. Scorsese actually made a musical very early in his career called \"New York, New York\", with Robert Deniro and Liza Minelli. It is not considered one of his stronger works and thus I have never bothered to watch it. But I doubt there is any similarity to Joker 2. I believe when the filmmakers were tasked to make a sequel, another angle was sought to make it worth their while.Hence, for the sake of adding more to the thin story, and to utilise a vehicle for their creative efforts, it became a musical. I don\\'t like musicals. But I was unsure what my reaction would be to this strange mix of a film, so I gave it a chance. I can\\'t help but bring up the Coppola movie \"Megalopolis\", which was released a couple weeks before this film. I was tossed about whether to see what was summarily declared a flawed film. Ultimately I decided to wait until video.My decision to see this film, despite the warnings about it being a musical, came down to curiosity. Knowing I was willing to see it at least once, I chose to screen it in Imax. Trying not to follow critic reactions to the film, I nevertheless had to admit the musical angle didn\\'t work for me. I don\\'t like musicals. I will chalk it up to a failed experiment. The most poignant aspects of the Joker character in the world of Scorsese were encapsulated in the excellent first Joker movie. Here in the sequel, the aspects of his life in prison are underwhelming, and the real source of energy lay outside the prison walls.As for Harlequin, she also was perhaps a little too normal. No real spark to her. Her character should have been extremely bi-polar, with mood swings that inspire appropriate set pieces. What I mean by \\'appropriate\\' is that filmmakers carefully avoid the pitfalls of getting too goofy and removing us from the gravitas of the story. Instead in Joker 2, their courtship is very dull. Even the musical numbers are restrained, albeit with a bit of bravado.There are some unexpected twists in the third act, but it takes too long to get there. However, it could very well be that time will change the attitudes toward this movie. I think of another Coppola movie, \"One from the Heart\". A very ordinary tale of a failing relationship set to music (but not a musical). It bombed when it opened, but later recognised as great filmmaking. So who am I to say what is at first an affront to audiences expecting a gritty thriller? It may spark its own subgenre and be lauded as great filmmaking.Final thoughts: This sequel is successful in accomplishing the idea of expressing Fleck\\'s fantasies as standard musical numbers, but it fails to put audiences under it\\'s spell. I give a 4 out of 10.',\n",

It's something you can understand and let go of. However, it must be said that the ending of this film makes no sense at all. Joker 1 was great, a fantastic story, but Joker 2 completely ruins it. I don't know what Todd Phillips was thinking, but in my opinion, he tried to cram too many elements into one thing. He tried to be realistic, but then made a musical. It just doesn't fit.And it's not even a truly realistic approach. It's realistic in terms of human thought, which is fine - what happens in the film could very well happen in real life. But as a film, it lacks structure. There's no proper beginning, middle, or end, and there's no connection between the first and second films. It feels like I'm watching a different Joker, not even deserving of the name. Todd Phillips did something incredible with Joaquin Phoenix's Joker (first movie) - it was brilliant. And Joaquin does a great job in Joker 2 as well. But Phillips destroyed the character.SPOILER ALERT He went with the idea that Joker is a philosophical concept, and by doing that, he essentially kills off Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur Fleck, which was a terrible, awful decision. In my understanding, Joker is no longer a person, but a thought. And Joker's possible son or the psychopath who killed him could be taking his place. But none of this makes any sense. It's a terrible ending that frustrates and disappoints. They built up something so carefully in the first movie, only to tear it down like it was nothing in the end of the second one. It raised expectations just to ruin them.The real Jokers were us, the ones who watched this film. However, I give it a 4 out of respect for the actors, the audiovisual work, and so on, which carried my mental health during the film.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"A movie which supposed to be the ascension of Joker turned into the destruction of Arthur. 😭 I wanted to see justice for him and punishment for the ones that did him wrong all his life. He really was a real Joker, a symbol for us all who suffered at the hand of bullies and people with power. But as it may seem...good people are weak people, therefore easy to break.More about the movie, why the on earth was it transformed into a MUSICAL??? There was no need for that, the music in the first one was more than perfect, why did they have to mess it up? Just because Gaga had to show up the singing talent? No thank you, Joker was more than that.I do appreciate though that they didn't transform this movie into a Lee movie and they still kept Arthur as the main character. This is the only thing i liked about this movie, I'm sorry, but it wasn't worth watching. 😔\",\n",

It doesn't quite live up to its predecessor, nor does it stand on its own as a compelling sequel.Rather than truly building on the foundation of the original, it rehashes familiar ideas while awkwardly attempting to introduce new ones-and it fails on both fronts. The potential for greatness is there, buried somewhere in the concept, but it never fully materializes.I think the idea of focusing on a trial could have worked. In fact, it might have been better suited as a limited series, giving the narrative room to breathe and develop. Instead, as a film, it ends up feeling rushed and disjointed.It's a shame that a film with so much promise ultimately falls flat, adding little to the story and tarnishing the legacy of what was once a standout movie.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"This take on the Joker could have only gone one of two ways: build up the Joker on his next steps towards the ultimate super-villain, or fold him up and place him neatly back into his plastic box with the rest of the toys. This is the most basic way of illustrating why this film shouldn't have been made in the first place. Since, it has been made plain by Todd Phillips that he didn't want to make this a franchise, or go beyond this sequel, then the latter boring option of resolving the events of the first film was the only course, and of course, what's the point of that.Even some of the oft praised, somewhat original, parts of the film, the opening animation sequence for example, foreshadow that you're in for a completely contrived (and completely absent from the first film) bit of screenwriting armchair psychology. Was the Joker a distinct personality of Arthur Fleck or just one dark side of him? Was the Joker just the abused loner all along? There is no deeper sigh to be had.In scene after scene, you keep waiting for the unfolding events to click into some kind of rhythm, but you get the sense that every time the writers weren't sure what to do next, they would distract you with a musical number from Lady Gaga. There was no natural flow, it all felt flimsily strung together, and that's all thrown on top of, and largely because of, a set of circumstances in which telling a compelling story was probably nearly impossible in the first place.\",\n",

       "    'Review': '\"Joker 2\" is, in many ways, an unnecessary sequel that never should have existed, reflecting the greed of a Hollywood studio seeking awards and box-office profits. I entered the theater with low expectations and reluctance, despite loving the original, mainly due to the inclusion of musical numbers, which could easily fall flat as they don\\'t fit the tone. Surprisingly, the first hour entertained me, and I thought, \"Well, it\\'s not as good as the original, but it\\'s not as bad as I expected,\" even with the evident excess of songs. However, my optimism was misplaced as that initial positive impression quickly crumbled as the film dragged on without any clear direction.The movie stretches on to the point where it feels repetitive, with most scenes taking place in the prison and courtroom, locations that quickly become tiresome and lacking in visual or narrative innovation. There was nothing impactful, no personal drama that made me want to engage with the story. \"Joker 2\" stalls more than a poorly rolled joint that never lights as it should.Another major issue lies with the characters. The Joker, brilliantly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in the first film, appears here as a hollow version of himself. There is no emotional or psychological development that does justice to the character\\'s complexity. While the first film showcased a downward spiral culminating in violence and chaos, here, the Joker lacks life and purpose. He moves slowly, directionless, as if lost within the plot. For such an iconic character, this is unforgivable.Lady Gaga is an excellent actress and singer, but she didn\\'t convince me as Harley Quinn. The problem isn\\'t her talent, which is undeniable, but rather the writing surrounding her character, which fails to make her memorable. In my opinion, this is the worst portrayal of Harley Quinn, wasting her talent, especially considering what Lady Gaga is capable of.Technically, there\\'s nothing to criticize about \"Joker 2.\" The cinematography, art direction, and sound are all impeccable, which only makes it more frustrating that the film offers nothing new narratively and, worse, leads us nowhere. Ultimately, it feels like a parade of stylized scenes and cliched lines, designed for sharing on Tumblr.One last thing: the $200 million budget is a mystery. Where did all that money go? The film mostly takes place in the same settings, lacking significant action moments or special effects to justify such an investment. I got the impression that most of that budget went to Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga\\'s salaries because, honestly, there\\'s not much else to justify it.As for the musical moments I dreaded, I have to admit they turned out better than I expected, but that doesn\\'t mean they work well. They often feel forced, as if hastily inserted to give the film a different identity, but they end up disrupting the pace and, in many cases, making the experience even more tedious.In summary, \"Joker 2\" can be visually stunning and technically charming, but it\\'s ultimately a completely unnecessary and weak sequel. It adds nothing new to the universe that the first film so effectively built and stands as another example of a terrible continuation of a great film, much like \"American Psycho 2.\" Its existence, like the narrative it presents, simply lacks purpose.',\n",

It is here where he meets Lee Quinzel played by Lady Gaga.This films tried to be a courtroom drama, romance and a musical amongst other things but unfortunately fails to land any of them particularly well.Whilst I understand the overall message of the film, the forward and development narrative is so thin that it just feels bland. Nothing really happens, there is no tension and the audience doesn't really have a reason to feel one way or the other about the message the film is giving.The court room scenes aren't interesting and the musical numbers don't seem to advance the narrative which makes them frustrating when considering the whole package.This is a very unfortunately sequel that did nothing to enhance or preserve the legacy of the excellent first film.\",\n",

So lets use her singing talent to let her sing as much as possible...The first hour, the movie builds up and could be a great intro to finally action from the Joker. The first hour of the movie, i would give it a 8+. But somehow the story writers probably thought; lets not make it a Joker movie after a hour. Lets just make it a court movie with a person who thinks he is the Joker and a woman that thinks she is Lee( she dresses way to nice to come close to the character). For me the movie was really good till the part when Arthur and Lee go out the prison due to a fire. But then the movie turns into a theatre show. With way to much singing, you could hear the people in the cinema sigh when one of the persons start singing again after that part. We expected finally to see the real Joker and the chemical relation with Lee. What was building up till that fire.The way how the movie was shot, the quality of the characters are high and the setting in the movie is great. But....It is save to say, the movie is not what it should be and it is a waste of the crew that played in this movie.

       "    'Review': \"This movie was unnecessary as I feel like there was no more story to cover after the first Joker movie. Alas, Hollywood wants more money and decides to bring in Todd Phillips to work on this next film. Out of curiousity, I saw this movie as I liked the first one and was very disappointed with how it turned out.Story: 3/10The story of Arthur Fleck is not enhanced. You'd think after the first Joker movie he would fully transform into his Joker persona, but once this movie begins, it immediately establishes that Arthur Fleck is still Arthur with Joker being a second personality that he has conflict with. This is a regression of what Arthur's character went through in the previous movie as its essentially a rehash of the first movie except its more limited. Every scene is one of these three settings: Prison, courtroom, or a musical number. Each one aside from the latter is not exciting nor gets anywhere.Harley 'Lee' Quinn has the hots for Arthur, but only loves his Joker personality. Its actually revealed that she lied to him about most of her life and that she is messing with him. Which is actually a complete swap of Joker and Harley's traditional relationships. Which further enhances the problem of the Joker not acting like the Joker.The final act of the movie is incomprehensive as Arthur Fleck gets raped by the security guards at Arkham for calling them out in court and this makes Arthur to denounce his entire Joker personality. This in turn assassinates Arthur Fleck's character and makes the first movie extremely pointless. Then a random explosion happens and Arthur escapes only to get dumped by Harley. After this catastrophe, Arthur is sent back to prison and gets killed by an inmate who carves a smile onto their face. That is the entire ending and I wish I was kidding.Two-thirds of the movie has boring repetitive scenes that go nowhere while the last one-third goes off the rails in the messiest way possible. Its mind boggling!Effects: 7/10Despite the plot being bad, the effects are solid. They're not top tier, but I think the cinematography and soundtrack by Hildur Guðnadóttir are well done! I think the musical numbers are the best part of the film as they are the only exciting parts of the film. I also love the animated scene even if it ruins Arthur Fleck's character in about a few seconds.Acting: 6/10The acting in this movie is also solid. Joaquin Phoenix doesn't skip a beat as Arthur Fleck, but Lady Gaga is fine as Harley Quinn, but there isn't anything to write home about her performance. The other actors are either forgettable or fine.Value: 3/10This sequel negates everything the first movie established and kills any chance that Arthur Fleck embraces his persona as the Joker. I call him Arthur Fleck a whole lot because he does not feel like the Joker. Sure there is good musical numbers, but their main purpose is to keep you awake as you're falling asleep from boredom. This film may not be connected to any cinematic universe, but Joaquin Phoenix's potential as the Joker was tarnished in this movie.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'I saw the review scores so low and attributed the bulk to the mass social media reception being against the fact that it was a \"musical\". I also have a habit of enjoying most comic movies I see regardless of review scores. To begin, I\\'m all for the musical aspect of Joker and Harley - considering their mental state, there\\'s no reason to believe they view the world in any other way. Gaga played her part marvellously, as did Phoenix. However, at the end, it felt like nothing had happened.Firstly, with the score, while all the songs were good, they were all pretty mellow or old school jazz. I prefer my Joker and Harley with a dash of pure genuine psychopathy, so I would have preferred a few up beat or wild-eyed songs in the mix. I was a bit underwhelmed in that sense.I watched this movie with my dad having high hopes. The first movie was good, again, it wasn\\'t my favourite interpretation of Joker simply because it lacked what I felt the essence of Joker was (purely insane for the sake of insanity); however, not what this review is about. I was hoping this movie, having the aftermath of the first, introduction of Harley, and the musical element added in might amp up some of the insanity of the Joker, and this movie might round him out as the character. Or, at the very least, tell an interesting story that brings these two to raining crime down on Gotham. Not looking for big bangs or flashy lights. But, at the end, I looked to my dad and we simply thought - what actually happened in this movie?(spoilers to follow)In a nutshell, he\\'s in Arkham. One guard is *relatively* nice to him. He meets Harley in a singing class. We don\\'t really see much psychotic elements from her throughout the movie, just a general fascination with \"Joker\". He goes to court. It\\'s going *relatively* well. He fires lawyer to represent himself. We think, this must be where things start to amp up. Doesn\\'t do too much.Guard kills Joker\\'s #1 fan in Arkham and Arthur, cracks? Goes full 180, drops \"Joker\", confesses to everything all mopey, but doesn\\'t even mention the fact that the guards killed an inmate? Doesn\\'t take the chance to expose the conditions or treatment he had on live TV? If he wish he didn\\'t do the killings, why wouldn\\'t someone with that mindset even casually mention his reason for turning being a follower getting suffocated the night before?Car bomb goes off. Nobody enters the courtroom, Arthur flees and is found by a random follower who drives him away. Arthur wakes up and ditches the getaway car. Runs to the iconic stairs and finds a sad Harley with newly cut hair. He speaks pretty sanely, she sings and ditches him for dropping \"Joker\". He gets arrested again.Gets called over for a visitor. Inmate wants to tell a joke, ends up stabbing Arthur a number of times in an unflashy manner. Seems like Arthur\\'s dead now. That\\'s, it? The story sums up that he goes to court, found guilty, killed in prison. Seemed rather pointless. Not sure if this was to imply \"Arthur Fleck\" was merely AN identity of the original Joker, and a new inmate or goon will take his place? Sounded like some eerie laughter in the background, but not enough emphasis to promote this assumption.This leads me and my hopeful-comic-reading mind to believe there is no conspiracy, no ulterior motives, no secret endings or hints at the next true Joker. This seems like a movie someone made to show what a \"realistic\" interpretation of the character Joker would be like in the \"real world\", which (as I already mentioned) I find diminishes the point of the character. And apparently, also this movie.Went in open minded with high hopes, boy was I caught off guard.',\n",

There were times when Gaga and Phoenix had in screen chemistry, but they were so over presented to the audience.One can only hope for a part 3 that redeems itself, but judging on past history of the majority of sequential films, the chances are low of that happening.The cinematography, music (song selections) and lighting was stunning and effective, but the script just seemed disjointed and hollow.

This is a film that pretends the protagonist is Joker. This is not even a film, it's a movie. Unnecessary songs, uneven plot, unengaging themes, under utilisation of Harley, this film has one redeeming factor, shots look good. This sequel wasn't needed, and now here we are, with a half baked monetization attempt to capitalise on the first one's success. It was released in IMAX. For What?? It costed 200 Million $. For What?? Garbage that is this movie? Disappointed.\",\n",

To me, Joker was a nearly flawless movie. I expected the same from this and it didn't even come close.Joaquin and Gaga were convincing in their madness. They had me convinced of their insanity within minutes of the movie. Joaquin's acting was superb, as usual, but the script was so terrible that it didn't matter. In all actuality, Joaquin's performance was the only good thing about the whole movie.If the rest of the movie mirrored the last scenes, it would have blown my socks off. My personal advice is to fast forward it to the last 15 minutes.\",\n",

DEFIENTLY A BAD MOVIE.I wanted more action and there was like no plot , it did show his madness pretty well it explained alot of how he was crazy and why he turned out to be crazy , they should definitely delete this movie from all platforms.Lady gaga was probably the whole reason the movie turned out bad because she wanted it to be a musical.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Except for the acting (which was great, given the talent), none of this movie worked.Joker 2 is mostly about Arthur Fleck dealing with his split personality against the backdrop of a boring murder trial with no real twists or turns. There are frequent musical numbers which supposedly represent Fleck's imagination, but all of them are fairly boring and sound the same.There's no action to speak of and no real plot developments. There's little-to-no references to Batman lore. There's no extravagant set pieces - almost all the movie takes place in a courtroom or in jail. The relationship development between Fleck and Harley Quinn is pointless and leads nowhere.The budget of this movie was supposedly $200 million. HOW? This felt like an unpolished first draft of a sad attempt at a Broadway musical about a mentally ill patient.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I was in the minority of people who were really excited for a musical. I enjoy camp movies and I think there could be a lot of artistic merit and show of talent within non traditional cinema storytelling. E.g. Lighthouse, Poor Things.So a Joker and Harley musical sounded like a lot of fun. Especially since they can incorporate a lot of compatible elements like their quirkiness, physical and wit based comedy, their showmanship, their violence, and the overall over the top Gotham aesthetic that can be found in a lot of DC media/comics. And Harley will also be played by a great singer who does a lot of over the top performances. It must at least be somewhat good.Instead it was so boring, and miserable. It was self indulgent bleakness that was pointless in every possible way. It should be impossible to make a Joker and Harley musical this excruciatingly dull. And yet they achieved it. And I watch a lot of miserable movies (I liked A Serbian Film), at least those movies remember that there should still be an element of fun. It's like they wanted the movie to be unwatchable.I do have a lot of other issues with the movie but i expected or at least can deal with those issues. The making of a movie that should be by definition at least an ounce of fun instead be the equivalent of watching paint dry is what killed me.\",\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': 'Big Disappointment',\n",
       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is a significant departure from the original \"Joker\" (2019), both in tone and execution, leaving some audiences disappointed. While the first \"Joker\" was celebrated for its gritty, realistic portrayal of mental illness and societal collapse, the sequel ventures into a musical direction that feels disjointed and lacks the same emotional depth. The shift to musical numbers with Lady Gaga\\'s Harley Quinn disrupts the raw intensity that made the original so impactful, leaving viewers feeling disconnected from the story.The narrative is muddled, and it often feels like style is prioritized over substance. While Joaquin Phoenix still delivers a strong performance, the overall impact is less striking. The original Joker\\'s chaotic descent into madness was grounded in a sense of grim reality, but the sequel\\'s fantastical elements undermine that realism, making it difficult to take seriously.Joker 2 tries to follow the success of its predecessor but unfortunately falls flat. The film is filled with unnecessary musical numbers that seem to exist solely to stretch the runtime to two hours, adding nothing of value to the story. What could have been a gripping narrative quickly turns into a dull courtroom drama that drags on without purpose, failing to maintain any real tension.The plot itself is riddled with nonsensical moments, such as characters freely smoking and carrying lighters in prison-a glaring oversight that undermines any sense of realism. The decision to focus so heavily on the trial scenes makes the movie feel stagnant and monotonous.Joaquin Phoenix, who once elevated the role of Joker to Oscar-winning heights, is unfortunately dragged down by this disaster of a sequel. It\\'s disheartening to see such a talented actor stuck in a film that feels beneath him.In the end, Joker 2 is a wasted opportunity-an uninspired mess that never should have been made. A misstep for Phoenix, and a major letdown for fans.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Before watching the movie, I avoided reading reviews or watching trailers because I had incredibly high expectations. With stars like Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, I was hoping for an intense and profound portrayal of the Joker-a character known for his dark, complex, and psychopathic nature.While Phoenix and Gaga give solid performances, the film falls flat in delivering the story we all wanted. Instead of diving deep into the Joker's twisted psyche, we're given an odd mix of musical numbers and dance sequences that feel out of place, often popping up every few minutes without any real purpose. The Joker's torment, his darkness, and his complexity-all of that is missing.What makes it worse is that we all know this isn't the *real* Joker from the comics or earlier films. But even with that freedom, the movie wastes the potential to explore the more psychological, chaotic side of the character. Instead, we're left with a shallow version of what could've been a gripping dive into madness.The supporting characters, like Harley Quinn (played by Gaga), are equally underserved. Instead of playing into their notorious, toxic dynamic, her character feels one-dimensional, with little depth to their connection. The lack of meaningful interaction between the Joker and figures like Murray Franklin or even Arkham inmates drains the story of any tension or intrigue.It's a real shame because, with the right direction, this could've easily been one of the best films of the year. Instead, it's a disappointment. Save yourself the time and money-this one doesn't live up to the hype.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'I loved the first film and believe that most of us did for the gritty, dramatic telling of \"the Joker\\'s\" real life. Getting to understand the character, a character we have all known for years, and starting to see why the joker went on to do all the horrific things he did.Sitting down to watch the second film I was hoping to experience more of this, for the movie to delve further in to the character. See him develop further from the fragile and misguided man we saw in the first film to the Joker we have all known from years of watching Batman.Folie à deux unfortunately abandoned all storytelling and character development. Instead they decided to introduce new characters with no clear view integration. Harley Quinn played by Lady Gaga was introduced this film but there is no development of any type of relationship. From their meeting the two were already in an intense relationship. We learn little to no more about the Joker, and why he behaves his why. There is absolutely no story to the film, no development of anything we\\'d experienced from the first film, no sense of the whole film but has been made to showcase the singing ability of Lady Gaga.I feel that Lady Gaga showed us that she is not an actress playing the role of Harley Quinn in a very unconvincing manner when required, however spent majority of the film singing, making little to no sense and adding nothing to the story whatsoever. In truth she is not truly to blame as I believe the writing and directing of this film was abysmal and only tailored for her to showcase her singing abilities rather than for the audience\\'s enjoyment, vastly different from the first film in this sense.Joaquin Phoenix did show more range than I thought he had and based on his brilliant performance in an otherwise disappointing film has gone up in my estimations.Best thing to come out of this film is Todd Phillips announcement that he will no longer be making Joker films. Truly ruined what could have been a phenomenal franchise.',\n",

It's interesting of all these DC pictures with Joker in it plus the original Adam West's Batman all played different stages and characters of Joker. Each actor going to great lengths to play Joker. Nonetheless Joker is portrayed as Insane and Psychotic. Criminal master mind. A villain that wants to watch the world burn. Alfred said it best. (Michael Cain). But this version of Joker was a man who went through so much bad luck that it consumed him and no one was willing to help him, talk about it and help him work through it. This category I gave it a 10Now talking about this one!!! Joker was at a stage were he was accepting his fate as a murderer and with mental health issues. His lawyer was defending him to see about getting out of jail or reduced sentencing due to mental illness. But was tarnish with Lee Quinnzell. She poisoned him into thinking The Joker can break out and rain havoc. He didn't want it anymore. He accepted it. This part I gave it a 8.Lady GaGa was horrible!!!! No Performance Art entertainment performers should be allowed in pictures. She was a made to play a Harley Quinn, she does look psychotic. She brought her singing gig into this movie which it could've been left out. But Gaga music being a huge hit brings in the younger crowd. But she lowered the standards on Joker making his character to be a sissy and use music to tell a story. I hate performers becoming actors. They have no business being in pictures and no business even pursuing acting. She needed something to do and figured wth I'll capitalize on DC. No way!!!! I think the script was meant to be a regular movie and Gaga wanted in and passed an audition and or knew a producer then bypassed the audition. Then they rewrote it and turned it into a musical. Ughhh. With this remark I rate this a -18The instrumental soundtrack was perfect. The chello was perfect for his soundtrack. This section brought the score back up to a 9.Making no since tying into Batman.This section is 1.Lady Gaga's performances was a downer. Bringing the final score to a 4.

So, I knew from the onset, I wasn't going to find this film to be even half as good as its predecessor. But, nonetheless, I still gave this a watch...Struggling with his dual identity, failed comedian Arthur Fleck meets the love of his life, Harley Quinn, while incarcerated at Arkham State Hospital.I found the film to be surprisingly, not as bad as I had anticipated. That's not to say I thought the film was good or ace either. At best, it's average, or below average, preferably. It's still what I & many other fans of the first film would call an unnecessary sequel & one that does a pretty naff disservice to the first which was, again, perfect on its own.The story is ok, but nothing special. It's pretty much a Law & Order Film with musical sequences added in along with some dark & comical scenes for good measure. There are some funny scenes to be had here & the musical parts weren't as bad as I thought they were going to be, I was expecting the film to be more musical & less story-like.There's some action, violence, gore & fights to be had & we get some eye candy with Lady Gaga, so there's that. The actors do a good job here despite the weak & lackluster material they have to work with. The films runtime is overly long at 2 hours & 10 minutes (130 minutes) & has some pacing issues.The ending was pretty disappointing as well sad to say & disappointing as I was going to give this film a bit more of a higher rating. There were some good parts to this film, but ultimately, it was a pretty dull film that lacked the excitement of the first.Overall, it's as disappointing as you've heard & one that I would sort of recommend but would tell you not to expect too much of as it's a pretty poor excuse for a sequel. Watch at your own risk.4/10.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"The first act started strong and starts to plummet slowly from there. Joaquin adds another amazing performance to his career along with Lady Gaga who shows her voice in her approach to Harley Quinn. The movie suffers from an overly artistic approach with a slow and boring, but visually appealing narrative. The film doesn't payoff in almost anything it set up and ends up feeling like it fell short when it didn't have to. The most clear issue is the pacing and placement of the musical scenes. I understand the unique approach that the genre had to offer, but I think it's not utilized correctly and it makes it more difficult to chew and feel slower. It had great potential to be a powerful sequel, but ends up falling short due to poor pacing, an underwhelming plot, but great performances that leave the film with at least one thing to praise. 4/10.\",\n",

At least in my book. It is a joy to watch this guy on screen as he becomes so totally immersed in the roles he plays and as the Joker, he did not fail. Lady Gaga also held her own and although I've always been a fan of hers for her unique voice as a singer, she has shown over the years that she is a force to be reckoned with on the big screen. Anyway, getting back to the movie as a whole, it was a strain to watch. I was lost, desperately longing for more, something I could walk away with to tell my friends to that they must watch this film. Unfortunately I can not say that, instead I called my younger brother, who is the biggest comic book geek to ask him what I had just witnessed.

Unlike the first film, this movie has practically no story, but rather a series of strange delusional vignettes that were thrown together along with musical numbers that got old very fast and made the run time way longer than needed for how unentertaining it actually was. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a decent performance, but it's nowhere near as good as he was in the first film. I kept waiting in anticipation thinking this must be building towards some big moment that unfortunately never arrives, and instead was left with nothing but disappointment as the movie ends on a worse note than it began.I was on the fence when I watched the trailer, but now having seen it I kind of wish I wouldn't have.

And I once thought it might get better after the bomb in the court, for the first time I am surprised and want to know how it ends, and best of all, there's no song. But it gets WORSE. The whole point of that bomb scene is probably just give Lady Gaga a reason to show up again and make her exit.The whole thing tells the worst story you can think of about Joker, if it's telling a story at all. It ends in the worst way I can think of. It's like the director can't wait to tell the world how much he despises Joker to prove that he's not a sociopath.It RUINS Joker for me.\",\n",

The main problem is not that the movie is a musical; the problem is the empty story with a slow rhythm that makes the movie feel like an eternity. Lady Gaga's perfomance is very lazy and boring like her character and Joaquin Phoenix seems zero interested in this movie. The music is very forgettable and the choreographies are poor and unexciting. Also, the worst part of this movie is the ending because it seems that the director wanted to mock his fans.

       "    'Review': 'So, the first \"Joker\" movie was a well executed film. It wasn\\'t great by any means - as it was, essentially, a sanitized, ideologically confused remake of \"The King of Comedy\" mixed with \"Taxi Driver\" - but it was beautifully shot and featured a central performance by Joaquin Phoenix that was hypnotic in its intensity.This sequel, despite being 16 minutes longer, has half the energy and the focus of its predecessor. It\\'s still well shot, even though much of the grit is gone, replaced by a slicker, less interesting cinematography.Phoenix\\'s performance feels way less committed and intense as the actor seems to be on autopilot for much of the movie. Gaga gives a pretty good turn - nothing great, as she isn\\'t really a great actress, but her performance is definitely good. However, there\\'s never a real chemistry between the two and all of their interactions feel forced, passionless and mechanical. The matter isn\\'t helped at all by the pacing, that would feel more appropriate for a trailer than for a film with the same runtime as \"Megalopolis\".The rest of the cast is largely irrelevant, except maybe for Gleeson who puts in a serviceable performance.This new \"movie\", if one can even call it that (it\\'s really more of a string of \"things that happens, often times just in the characters\\' head\"), however, is even more the cinematic version of a trollish edgelord than the previous one. It doesn\\'t has much to say and it thinks it\\'s being provocative in the way it says it, when, really, it\\'s mostly regurgitating old ideas (a good chunk of which are once again stolen from \"The King of Comedy\") - while avoiding any kind of commitment with the ever cheap \"it could be all in his head\".Also, the musical part of it - and it\\'s a large part - doesn\\'t work at all and drags the movie down, grinding the plot to a halt with every. Single. Musical. Number.Here\\'s how the structure of this movie works for the entirety of its 2 hours and 18 minutes: possibly realistic scene - musical number - possibly realistic scene - musical number - on and on and on up until the end, when suddenly it remembers it needs to have some kind of message.What the movie is trying to say is that the Joker is a pathetic loser and a failure, that the kind of people that would see him like a hero are the lowest society\\'s lowlife (both of which are true, obviously) and, to get out of the metaphor, that Trump and especially his supporters live in their own, pathetic fantasy world (also true, of course).The problem with this message is that it comes after the previous installment - a movie that glorified a psychopath under the false pretense of making some kind of statement about the importance of mental health. That was a cover, of course, but it becomes problematic the moment this new chapter tries to frame a mental patient like a loser. So, what ends up happening, is that the political side of the message is lost in a muddled plot and the social side of the message becomes the most horrible, backwards compilation of stereotypes about people with mental issues.And none of this would be a problem (movies, like any form of art, shouldn\\'t be subject to any kind of social responsibility or morality) if it wasn\\'t served by such a mediocre, unfunny, dull, mess of \"film\".Eventually, the utter lack of logic in the (supposedly) real scenes - especially in the unbearably long courtroom section - begins to compound and cannot be excused any longer by a simple \"uh, but maybe it\\'s all in his head\" (otherwise, the entire thing is all in his head and becomes completely meaningless).The movie closes with Arthur Fleck being repeatedly stabbed in the stomach by a laughing psychopath who, immediately after, proceeds to carve himself a smile on his own face.And... That\\'s it. That\\'s a perfect encapsulation how dumb \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"The first film did not need a sequel, but when we heard of a sequel, we had excitement. I have never felt so disappointed watching a film in my life. Apart from some brilliant acting from Joaquin and the guards, and the stunning visuals, this film practically has no other positives. The most disappointing aspect of this film, in my opinion, is the ending. The ideology and symbolism of the ending is perfect, but the execution seems rushed and is awful.The rest of the film feels dragged out and slow, with unneeded musical sequences every five minutes, but the most important thing of the film, was rushed.The lengthy courtroom sequence was the only storyline in the film. There was no character development of Harvey Dent. This could have been Harley's origin story but her 'shared madness' is not shown at all in this film.This film is nothing short of a cashgrab and it despises the first film by trying to completely undo what make Joker so great to begin with.If you genuinely watched the first ten/twenty minutes of this film, left for an hour, and came back in, there'd be no difference, as the storyline was lacking.To be honest, this is a must-see film for fans of the first Joker and DC, as it practically ends the potential world of Arthur Fleck.This film is a love/hate film, and in my opinion I have to watch this again to get my head around what I just witnessed.3.7 out of 10 for me.\",\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': '\"Joker: Folie à Deux\": When Sequels Go Off the Rails',\n",
       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is one of this year\\'s most anticipated films, or maybe just my most anticipated film, yet it\\'s this year\\'s biggest letdown film. The first Joker is very special for me and my page, as this was the first movie I reviewed, and I also enjoyed it. I\\'m a very sentimental person, and when they announced that there would be a sequel, I was excited. Then they confirmed Lady Gaga would play as Harley; I was even more excited. The biggest lesson I learned from this movie, I guess, is to lessen your expectations. From the direction and writing, the whole film felt like it was written by a mediocre kid at school who thinks everything they did is superior---It\\'s that bad, really!The writing and direction felt uninspired and lazy. The film follows Arthur Fleck\\'s life, waiting for his trial for the crimes of Joker. While struggling with his dual identity as Arthur Fleck and Joker, Arthur stumbles upon true love and finds the music that\\'s always inside him. The synopsis may have the potential to be a poignant exploration of mental health, but the film struggles to find its footing. The pacing is almost unbearable, as it gets dragged and dragged with nowhere to go. The film doesn\\'t know what it is trying to convey; the dialogue is flat, and the musical element does not match the narrative.One of the most disjointed elements is the musical component, which seems awkwardly inserted rather than seamlessly integrated into the narrative. The music fails to enhance the story or characters, instead feeling like an afterthought. Although the musical element serves as Joker and Harley\\'s fantasies, it just doesn\\'t work well with the narrative they are trying to deliver. Adding the musical aspect to their dialogues made the film almost feel comical and pretentious. Lee said, \"I\\'m pregnant.\" \"What?!\" Arthur replied, then Lee, out of nowhere, belted out, \"Why do birds suddenly appear every time you are near?\" It was hilarious.For a $200 million budget, it\\'s a massive letdown. It is weird to have this much budget, yet no extra or grand was happening. The film\\'s settings were only at the jail and courtroom, so where did the $200 million budget go? Compared to Denis Villeneuve\\'s \"Dune: Part Two,\" which was this year\\'s biggest film, it only has a $190 million budget, but the CGI effects and the quality of the film are far from \"Joker: Folie à Deux.\" Even the first installment has a budget of $65 million, yet it made an astounding $1.07 billion at the global box office.When it comes to the performances, both Joaquin Phoenix and Stefani Germanotta (famously known as Lady Gaga) were electrifying. I appreciate that they are singing live, which added authenticity to their character, and the contrast in their voices sounded so good. However, due to the film\\'s lack of characterization, the addition of Harley \"Lee\" Quinn to this saga is rather unnecessary and underutilized. The addition of Harley Quinn could have been a great character to explore, but as the movie progresses, she fades into the background although her character plays a vital role in Joker\\'s life; it\\'s not that she has less screen time but because there was nothing written for her character aside from being Joker\\'s love interest. Although Joaquin Phoenix was great in this movie, it\\'s apparent that they are capitalizing on his success in the first installment after winning the Oscar for Best Actor and the movie gaining $1 Billion at the box office. Still, sadly, it turned out to be a disorganized and uninspiring film.Everything in this film felt like a mistake. It\\'s a cash-grab movie with nothing promising to offer. The musical aspect could be more cohesive to the whole film. Even the final scene felt like Todd Philips just wanted to end the Joker saga to avoid any further sequels. From start to finish, the film stumbles to find its ground. The entire experience of watching this film felt like witnessing a series of missteps. It comes across as a project primarily motivated by the desire to generate revenue without offering anything genuinely innovative or exciting for the audience. As a sequel, there is an expectation to build upon the strengths of its predecessor, but this movie struggles to find its own identity and purpose. This film is particularly disappointing for fans of the first installment, like myself. The original set a high bar with its depth and complexity, and as someone who appreciated its nuances, I hoped for a sequel that would expand on those strengths. Instead, I left the theater feeling let down by a film that failed to capture the essence of what made the original so impactful.In conclusion, this sequel misses the mark on multiple fronts, failing to capture the depth and innovation that made its predecessor so compelling. Its lack of cohesion and purpose feels like a disservice to fans who anticipated a continuation worthy of the original\\'s legacy. The disjointed musical elements rushed ending, and overall inconsistency contribute to a viewing experience that feels more like a series of missed opportunities than a meaningful story. While the film may achieve commercial success or not, it ultimately falls short of delivering the artistic and narrative fulfillment that audiences were hoping for. As a fan, seeing such potential go unrealized is disheartening, leaving one to wonder what could have been with more thoughtful execution. \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is a testament that not all sequels are necessary.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Spoiler Alert:I get what the director was going for, but the execution was dragged out and very boring. The entire film looked like it was filmed in only three locations, and it was like watching paint dry.The first film told an excellent, compelling story about a person with trauma and showed how events could drive a person to take on the persona of \"The Joker,\" embrace his dark humor, and execute it into existence. The character development was fantastic, supplemented by the great acting by Joaquin Phoenix.In the second film, the director decides to take a turn and sort of repeat the same character development but, in the end, takes a turn for \"The Joker\" to be an ethos rather than a singular person. It could have been executed way sooner because people wanted a continuation of the Joke rather than a 2 hr dragging spin-off for one message.The musical was dreadful. The first one was not a musical, so I did not understand why they would make the 2nd one a musical. Especially because musicals are not liked to the majority public who liked the first film.Lady Gaga was a very lackluster Harley. She did not seem like a psychopath that embodies Harley but rather just a weirdo. I\\'ve seen Homeless people in LA embody a better Harley than Lady Gaga.Summary of the film:\\nPrison, Musical, Court, Musical, Prison, Musical, Court, Musical, Prison Musical, Court, Musical, Prision, Musical, Court, CITY FINALLY, just kidding, Prison, Musical.',\n",

The first Joker movie was a masterpiece, praised for its dark, gritty tone and Joaquin Phoenix's brilliant performance. But now, five years later, they return with this... and it's a musical? I struggle to understand the logic behind it.After also seeing Joaquin Phoenix in Napoleon, where Ridley Scott's direction fell short, I'm left wondering why two great films with such a phenomenal actor can fail so miserably. Phoenix remains a class act, but the films themselves are hugely underwhelming. We've been waiting for this Joker sequel for five years, only to be met with a baffling, disappointing result.A massive letdown!\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Oh dear. Like so many other cinema goers, I was so looking forward to this film, but left the cinema at the end feeling utterly deflated. The first instalment of Joker was a breath of fresh air, particularly considering films portraying the DC comics world have often received mixed reactions, usually predominantly negative. Joker was dark, edgy and humorous. Joker Folie a Deux has none of these qualities. The concept of the film being part musical sounded a weird idea when I first heard about it, but with Lady Gaga on board I thought it could work. Making the basis of the film a courtroom 'drama' was a massive own goal though. The rhythm of the film fell as flat as a pancake. I feel sorry for Joaquin Phoenix who clearly suffered for his art judging by his gaunt appearance. This is another classic example of Hollywood trying to be too clever for its own good. The writers need to understand that 'if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it' Give the fans what they want and they will return time and again. A massive wasted opportunity.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Though I sat through this whole film retaining my hope that the story was going to go somewhere or give me something unexpected, it just didn't. The storyline is completely as to be expected from the ending of Joker and Todd Philips seems to have pulled a Peter Jackson and taken what should have been 30 minutes of material at most and stretched it out to over 2 hours. Harlee Quin adds absolutely nothing to the story and seems to have been included due to the Deux in the title. Really, in my opinion, the character played by Lady Gaga shouldn't even have the honour of being called Harley Quinn. There is no apparent mental illness that I could see from either of the main characters, something that seems have gotten lost from the first film. The music (oh dear god, the music!) is infinitely distracting and does nothing to drive the story forward...Coogan and Gleason are both exceptional actors appearing to play extended cameos which is a crying shame. Fortunately Joaquin Phoenix manages to keep you engaged and despite being appallingly poorly written as a character, Lady Gaga is fun to watch. There are a few scenes in this film that shine but all of them within Jokers own mind rather than any real life madness.Just one big disappointment.\",\n",

The decision to incorporate musical elements into the narrative feels forced and ultimately detracts from the story. The singing sequences, while visually impressive, serve little and fail to contribute anything meaningfull to the plot or character development.Furthermore, the film seems almost intent on undermining the success of its predecessor.

It\\'s as if the filmmakers were trying to distance themselves from the first film\\'s realism and critical acclaim.The real letdown, even to the point of frustration, is that the film could have been a powerful exploration of mental health and our society\\'s morbid fascination with serial killers.

It\\'s a missed opportunity to delve deeper into such important topics.The film\\'s decision to stray from the gritty realism of the original \"Joker\" is a missed opportunity and leaves one wondering if the filmmakers were more interested in creating a spectacle than telling a meaningful story.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Saw this in theaters the day it came out. Both my wife and me love the first movie, so we were excited to see this.Unfortunately the movie doesn't come close to what made the first movie great. The story just isn't even remotely interesting. It largely rethreads what happened in the first movie, but not even by showing but telling. There's only so many times you can hear characters drone on about how the joker shot someone on live TV. The movie is cut with a frankly ridiculous number of songs woven in that for the most part serve 0 purpose to the story and primarily just break up the pace. It felt like a rather poor attempt st a musical. Both me and my wife were groaning by the 4th song due to boredom, unfortunately they just kept coming. In a mostly empty theater (afternoon showing) there were still 3 seperate groups of people that walked out 45-30 minutes before the end (as what felt like the 10th song started in).Throughout the movie the ending is somewhat foreshadowed as we see Arthur coming to terms with what the joker has done. Phoenix does an amazing job of once again portraying a man struggling with mental issues. We were less impressed with gaga. While great in her own way she didn't feel like a good fit for Harley. The relationship between her an Arthur also felt like the wrong dynamic (which, considering the events of the ending, makes sense). We felt the entire movie should have been the first 45 minutes or so of the actual film (which might roughly be the runtime without all the useless songs) before the story really kicks off.In summary the acting and cinematography were great as it was in the first movie. But a pretty picture cannot save the absolute train wreck of a story and the lack of any character progression or stakes.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker: Folie à Deux fails to live up to the eerie brilliance of its predecessor. The first Joker was raw, grounded, and unsettling in its portrayal of a man spiraling into madness. But this sequel seems to have lost its way, attempting to cash in on the first film\\'s success without delivering anything meaningful.First, the tone of the movie is all over the place. Is it a musical? A psychological thriller? A satire? \"Folie à Deux\" suffers from identity confusion, and the result is a jarring experience that lacks coherence. The inclusion of musical numbers feels like an awkward gimmick rather than an organic part of the story, pulling audiences out of what little immersion the film manages to create. What could have been a bold artistic choice instead feels forced and disjointed.The character development, which was a cornerstone of the first film, is almost non-existent here. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s Arthur Fleck feels like a watered-down version of his original character. Rather than deepening his persona, the sequel recycles his descent into madness, making his arc feel repetitive and stagnant. The once-compelling transformation has now become stale and predictable.Harley Quinn, played by Lady Gaga, is another misfire. While her casting promised something new and exciting, the character is underwritten and one-dimensional, more of a plot device than a fully realized person. Their dynamic lacks the chilling chemistry that one might expect, and their relationship feels undercooked, missing the dark psychological depth that should have been explored.The music, meant to enhance the film\\'s chaotic atmosphere, ends up being one of its weakest elements. The musical numbers feel out of place and awkwardly forced into the narrative. Instead of heightening tension or emotion, they disrupt the flow of the story, pulling viewers out of key moments. What could have been a unique stylistic choice ends up feeling like a gimmick, leaving the audience confused rather than captivated.The pacing is another major issue. The film drags at points, especially in the middle, where scenes seem to meander without purpose. With a bloated runtime, there are stretches of time where nothing of significance happens, leaving viewers to wonder where the plot is heading-if anywhere at all.Joker: Folie à Deux tries too hard to be edgy and different, but in doing so, it loses the emotional gravity that made the original so compelling. What\\'s left is a messy, shallow sequel that feels more like a parody of the first than a legitimate continuation. It\\'s a film that confuses shock value for substance and ambition for execution, ultimately leaving the audience disappointed and disconnected.In short, Joker: Folie à Deux is an overhyped, overindulgent follow-up that doesn\\'t hold a candle to the original. What could have been a rich psychological exploration has instead turned into a disorganized spectacle, devoid of the depth that made the first film iconic.',\n",

And although the songs were great, it really took away from the tension of the movie. And, when the scene was finally over, of that interesting stuff that was building up suddenly disappeared.And the ending, underwhelming the say the least.

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux is interesting as a concept, but sadly it doesn't have the greatest execution. At first when I heard there was going to be a second Joker movie I was intrigued since I loved the first one, but at the same time I was wondering if a second one had any reason to exist. Now after seeing the second one I know why it exists, and it's because the first one made 1 billion dollars. The movie does have its moments, but I definitely expected way more. The movie is about Arthur Fleck being given the death penalty for killing 5 people and has to go to trial, and throughout the movie we see Arthur fall in love with Lee Quinzel. Towards the end of the film Arthur excepts that the Joker doesn't exist, and after that Lee leaves him because she was only in love with Joker and not Arthur Fleck. After all of this the trial ends with Arthur receiving the death penalty, but seconds after this the court room explodes. The people behind the explosion were two Joker fans, and they put him in their car and get away. Eventually when they're in traffic Arthur gets out of the car and runs away, eventually he finds Lee and begs for her to stay with him, but of course she says that you're no longer Joker and walks away. After this the cops appear behind Arthur and arrest him, then we see Arthur back in prison watching TV. While he's watching TV one of the officers say that he has visitor, so he gets up to go see who it is, but right before he goes an inmate walks up to him and asks do you want to hear a joke. Arthur says yes, and after he's finished with the joke he says the exact final words Joker said to Murray, and then he stabs Arthur and starts laughing continuously, then he uses his knife and cuts his own mouth into a smile while Arthur bleeds out on the floor and dies. As I said the movie has its moments, but it's very flawed, it seems the movie is more focused over the musical scenes than the actual plot. There's also a lot of unanswered questions, at one part of the movie Lee tells Arthur that she's pregnant but she already lied to him many times during the movie so we can't say that she's definitely pregnant, also we never found out who the visitor is who wanted to see Arthur at the end of the film. Then there's many flaws with the plot, but I'm only going to mention a couple of them. What's the chance of Arthur finding Lee after escaping the court room, it isn't like he knew she was going to be there. Also how did that inmate get the knife without any of the guards finding out? Also I think the idea of that guy killing Arthur being the real Joker is both stupid and a very unsatisfying ending to Joaquin Phoenix's Joker, they pretty much undone Joaquin Phoenix's Joker as a character. I do have a couple positives though, Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga were amazing, and even though the movie is flawed it looks beautiful and the film has amazing cinematography. Overall I didn't like the film, there's a couple things I liked but there's many things I disliked, so I'll give this movie a 4 out of 10 stars!\",\n",

But for the life of my, I can't understand why they went this route with this story.The original Joker spent the entirety delving into the who and why of the character, and setting up what mischief Joker and his followers might be up to next. Yet instead of continuing that story, we end up retreading so much of the original, still finding the origin of the character before it ever leads to anything.I was fairly bored for the first hour, before it finally seemed to escalate when he fires his lawyer. But then it sort of ramps back down with Arthur turning back into a lame loser, rather than rising up in defiance against the system. Harley and many of his followers are disappointed in him, and I felt the exact same way. I believe that was the point, but I can't imagine many people liking this route.And I know I marked spoilers but I still won't give away the big one at the very end. But I was stunned at the conclusion of Arthur's story. All I could think is, that's what we've been building up to? That's what the amazing setup of the first movie leads to?In the end, I'd rather just have the open ending of the original without this lame conclusion and bare minimum of a story. Who knows what Arthur did after he shot Murray. In my imagination, it's significantly cooler and darker than what happens in this sequel.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 10/3/2024)\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"*Please stop singing* - Joker whispers pleadingly at one point, summarising the audience thoughts. (one of the few times where I actually heard a reaction from my fully packed auditorium)When Joker (2019) was released, it shocked audiences and critics alike, becoming a box office phenomenon, grossing over a billion dollars and earning widespread acclaim. A bold gritty, raw, and subversive experience that heavily borrowed from cinematic masterpieces like Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, while weaving in elements from Fight Club. These influences were evident, but ultimately, no one cared that the film wasn't entirely original because it was still brilliant in execution. Todd Phillips crafted a grim character study of Arthur Fleck, anchored by Joaquin Phoenix's transformative performance. It became a near-instant classic, defining what a modern psychological thriller could be within a comic book framework.Now, five years later, Joker: Folie à Deux tries to recapture that magic - and fails. Spectacularly.Phillips, this time, ventures further into his own vision, no longer leaning on the established classics that shaped the first film. The result? A disjointed, unfocused sequel that tries to be many things but masters none. The film attempts to blend multiple genres, from courtroom drama to psychological thriller to musical, yet never fully commits to any of them. Each element feels like a half-measure, teasing an interesting direction before abandoning it entirely. The end product is a film that has no clear narrative thread or identity.The most baffling creative choice was to mak Folie à Deux a musical. It's not inherently a bad idea - musicals can offer powerful commentary and depth when done well. However, here the songs feel awkwardly shoehorned into scenes, interrupting the already meandering plot. The musical numbers don't blend seamlessly with the story or add emotional weight; instead, they become unnecessary distractions rather than a hoped deeper exploration of the Joker's psyche. There's no clear reason why the Film needed to be a quasi-musical other than to stretch the thin story. Without these showpieces the film would be significantly shorter and its hollowness more obvious.Joaquin Phoenix's return as the Joker, while highly anticipated, is underwhelming. In the first film, his portrayal of Arthur Fleck was raw, disturbing, and compelling - a character study of a man unraveling. In the sequel, however, his character lacks the same depth and nuance. The film rehashes many of the same emotional beats and traumas from the first movie, offering little in terms of new insight. There are even flashbacks and redundant references to the events of the previous film, as if Phillips wasn't sure what direction to take and decided to lean heavily on past glories. Phoenix's delivers a strong performance but it's not as compelling as the first time. It felt kind of dispassionate at times, as though he either grew tired of the role or was given too much freedom in his portrayal. As a result, the Joker, once a tragic figure you couldn't take your eyes off, becomes less tangible and more abstract. The menace and unpredictability that made him such a fascinating character are absent here.Lady Gaga, meanwhile, brings a raw energy to her role as Harley Quinn, but she is underutilized throughout the film. Her character has none of the layers we saw in Margot Robbie's take on Harley Quinn. Gaga's Quinn feels like a shell of a character, a missed opportunity to add a new dynamic to the Joker's story. The chemistry between Phoenix and Gaga is there but never quite takes off, leaving Gaga's talents largely wasted.The pacing of Folie à Deux is its biggest downfall. The first half of the film moves so slowly that it feels as if it's deliberately wasting time, only for the second half to be nothing more than a repetition of the first Joker. Rather than progressing the narrative, the film constantly looks back, rehashing events from the first film through unnecessary exposition and flashbacks. There is no forward momentum, no fresh take on the story, and no meaningful development in the Joker's psychological journey. This backward-looking structure also dilutes any potential the film had in exploring new aspects of Arthur Fleck's mind. The psychological depth that was so integral to the success of the first film feels watered down here, leaving nothing of substance to grasp onto. The final act completely derails whatever semblance of narrative cohesion the film was trying to maintain.The final scenes leave the viewer not with a sense of closure or deeper understanding, but with frustration and confusion. It's a messy, misguided conclusion that fails to tie together the film's already loose threads. Call it provocation without substance. The viewer is left asking, What was the point of all this?Of course visually, the film is striking. Todd Phillips and his team have an eye for powerful imagery. The lighting, cinematography, and overall production design are aesthetically pleasing, with some hauntingly beautiful moments - particularly those involving the Joker, cigarette in hand, smoke swirling in the dim light. But there are only so many times you can watch the Joker, dramatically bathed in backlight, exhale cigarette smoke before even that feels tiresome. While Phillips deserves credit for crafting a beautiful film on the surface, it lacks the emotional and psychological depth required to make those images stick.The first film was a visceral exploration of societal alienation, child abuse and the therefore created mental illness, the sequel is aimless, shallow, and scattered. Instead of offering a deeper look into the mind of the Joker, it feels like Phillips wanted to make a statement - one that rebels against critics, fans, and even comic book lovers. But in doing so, he forgot to make a coherent film. What we're left with is a movie that's all style and no substance, a failed experiment that never finds its footing.Final Verdict: Todd Phillips swung for the fences with Joker: Folie à Deux, but missed. With weak character development, disjointed pacing, and a musical aspect that adds nothing, the film fails to capture the essence of what made the first Joker so memorable. The finale, which could have offered some redemption or clarity, instead devolves into a nonsensical, extravagant mess that leaves the audience bewildered and frustrated. Even the striking visuals can't mask the hollow core beneath, leaving the sequel as a perplexing and underwhelming addition to the Joker's story.Safe to say the biggest disappointment of the year. 3,5/10.\",\n",

While the character of Joker is iconic, this installment lacks the depth and originality seen in previous adaptations. The plot feels disjointed, relying heavily on shock value rather than nuanced storytelling. The film tries to replicate the grittiness of its predecessors but fails to provide any fresh perspective on the character or the world he inhabits. Performances are solid, but they can't save the movie from feeling like a missed opportunity to push the narrative boundaries of the Joker's complex psychology.

       "    'Review': 'Five years. That\\'s how long I waited, eagerly anticipating the next chapter in Arthur Fleck\\'s dark, twisted journey that shook the world with Joker (2019). The first film was a masterpiece - gritty, raw, unapologetically real. People connected to it on a visceral level. But after seeing Joker: Folie à Deux, my one overwhelming thought was: Why, Todd? Why?The film had so much potential, but what we got was a chaotic mess, completely out of touch with what *Joker* had originally set up. Let\\'s break it down:Lackluster Storytelling: Where was the story? There was no cohesion, no forward momentum. The film felt like it was rambling, disconnected. *Joker* 1 had us gripped in Arthur\\'s descent into madness, but here? It felt like they just stitched together random scenes. There were no stakes, no real suspense, no build-up. Instead, we were left wondering what happened to the raw, unfiltered tension from the first film.The Musical: Completely Off Track: I get it - musicals are a bold move, but this one? It just didn\\'t fit. The entire concept felt like an unnecessary distraction, completely out of sync with the grim world that *Joker* inhabits. Lady Gaga is incredible - no doubt. She was probably the best part of the film, but the musical element didn\\'t mesh with the gritty, psychological intensity that made Joker so captivating in the first place. Instead of adding depth, it came off as pretentious and forced.Where\\'s the Cinematic Brilliance?: Joker 1 was visually stunning. The cinematography had a purpose - every shot, every angle told a story. *Folie à Deux*? Not so much. The visuals felt bland and uninspired. There was nothing that made me sit up and say, \"Wow, this is a work of art.\" It was as if they forgot the very essence of what made Joker so visually engaging.No Dialogues: Where were the sharp, thought-provoking dialogues that Joker was known for? The first film had lines that stuck with you long after the credits rolled. In Folie à Deux, there wasn\\'t a single line that stood out. The film left no lasting impact in terms of narrative or dialogue. It\\'s like they completely missed the point.Music That Didn\\'t Hit the Mark: And then there\\'s the music. What happened? The score of Joker 1 was haunting, a perfect reflection of Arthur\\'s psyche. In Folie à Deux, the music didn\\'t add to the atmosphere - it detracted from it. Nothing about the score felt like it belonged in the world of *Joker*. It lacked intensity, lacked emotional resonance, and ultimately left me detached.A Disappointing Direction: I can\\'t help but feel this film was made simply to cash in on the success of the first one. It felt rushed, like no one really cared about crafting a meaningful story. Todd Phillips delivered a piece of art in *Joker* 1, but here, it feels like he lost his way. Was this film even necessary? Did anyone ask for this? The brilliance of *Joker* didn\\'t need a sequel, especially not one like this.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker: Folie A Deux (2024) :\\nMovie Review -After the blockbuster success of Joker (2019), Todd Phillips is back with a direct sequel, \"Joker: Folie A Deux.\" This time, the joker is not alone. Arthur Fleck is not alone anymore. He has found someone to love, and he doesn\\'t want to die. Lee, aka Harley Quinn, completes him; she \"gets\" him. \"She\\'s really something,\" says Arthur, and why not because she\\'s the only one who understands him, saying, \"He is not sick. He is perfect. Together, we are gonna build a mountain from a little hill.\" Now back to Joker\\'s climax and its psychologically disturbing characteristics, I asked myself, \"Did such a dark and intense story deserve a follow-up like this, I mean, the one filled with love, courtroom drama, and musicals?\" My heart said, \"Maybe yes,\" but my brain said, \"Maybe No!\"The film begins with mentally disturbed and nihilist Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) in jail, with his inner bones clearly showing up touching his external skin. This jail life was worse than the world outside-maybe that\\'s what they wanted to portray from Arthur\\'s point of view. He sees Lee (Lady Gaga) in a music room, and they create an instant attraction towards each other. Meanwhile, Fleck is going through medication and counseling, and his lawyer, Ms. Stewart (Catherine Keener), is trying to prove that he suffered through split personality disorder at the night of the crime. Lee is freed, and she goes on to give interviews about Fleck being a \"perfect\" guy to live in society, and then the trial begins with Harvey Dent (Harry Lawtey) fighting the case as an assistant district attorney. Will Arthur win the case? That\\'s what the film is all about in the second half.Frankly, I believe, the story of The Joker should have never become a love story or a courtroom drama, and here it becomes both. That wasn\\'t sensible at all. Yes, it doesn\\'t make sense to see a criminal who killed a person on a live show and five other people, trying to prove that it wasn\\'t him after all. Even a medical term like personality disorder can\\'t be an excuse in this case, as it was in Anniyan (2005). Moreover, seeing a morally disturbed and criminally advanced Joker as a puppet and a silent bully of the class doesn\\'t do justice to the image people have in mind. In the pre-climax scene, Joker sees a complete shift in his own mindset just after a sexual abuse by the guard. Similarly, Quinn\\'s obsession for the Joker, having a baby, and then abandoning him all happen so fast that you don\\'t see them as concrete reasons to carry the story. In short, it\\'s a \"love got him down\" kind of scenario, which has been in Hollywood since the 1930s in many gangster dramas, but instead of a femme fatale touch, Joker 2 is driven by guilty consciousness, dark blue nihilism, and personality conflicts. I still don\\'t understand, \"Why would Arthur even kiss his lawyer twice?\" Most of the musical numbers and crazy scenes I imagined from the trailer, turned out to be dream sequences, and a few were not there at all. Too much disappointment to Kitty!Performance-wise, it was a good show. Joaquin Phoenix stunned us all with his act in Joker, and he did it again in Joker 2. It\\'s just that the character has no graph and no soul this time, so it feels dry. The blood, the liquidated feel of that anger-everything was missing. Lady Gaga surprises as Harley Quinn-not very much to what we expected from the promos. She was looking promising from the pre-release movie clips already, and she delivers. A no-sorry female antagonist who doesn\\'t even care about her boyfriend who has finally turned yellow-oh yes, we don\\'t see such ladies in our movies often. Brendan Gleeson is that brutal guard in the jail, and be is awesome. Catherine Keener as a lawyer, Zazie Beetz as Sophie (a cameo), and Harry Lawtey as Dent, all have done fine in those small roles. Steve Coogan and dwarfy Leigh Gill add good support.Why would anyone want to make a Joker\\'s sequel a musical? I don\\'t understand. Joker: Folie A Deux\\'s musical numbers didn\\'t entertain me much the way that one scene from \"The Band Wagon\" (1953) did. Gaga singing the same lines or any other song would get my thumbs up any other day, but not today. The cinematography by Lawrence Sher was impressive. That smile with lipstick on a mirror and the top view of the four different color umbrellas taking Arthur in jail or all those dreaming musical sequences-Sher has done brilliant camerawork. Joker was conceived as a standalone film, and Joker 2 literally ends the saga-too quickly! The screenplay is boring and slow, which makes you feel sleepy (believe me, I felt so). The production design was fine, and the sound was well mixed, but nothing noticeable. I can\\'t even imagine that Todd Phillips directed a \"banger\" like \"Joker,\" and now he is the same person who directed a \"blunder\" like \"Joker: Folie à Deux.\" It\\'s just not acceptable. He hasn\\'t just disappointed the fans with this sequel but also destroyed the image of Joker created by Phoenix and himself only. Can\\'t believe how someone can really make a boring and meaningless sequel like this to a modern classic like \"Joker\" (2019). I wish it wasn\\'t \"true,\" and I could forget it as a \"fantasy.\"RATING - 4/10*',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Folly of a movie. The only reason they made this a musical is that otherwise, it would've been over under an hour and still, they couldn't fully commit to it. Phoenix and Gaga are spectacular with the material they've given. The direction is great combining the cinematography and music to give the film a pretty good pace considering nothing at all happens in the movie. It can't be called a full-on musical but the musical parts of the movie were the only thing that actually entertained me even though it was mostly pointless. And the writing is horrible in this movie.I loved the first part and thought a lot of the criticisms it got were actually things that the movie treated pretty well and it was the political climate the reasoning for so much criticism. But here, all those criticisms are made a lot more valid. The way it tries to empathise and criticize its protagonist is so dumb, and it doesn't exactly seem like the same character from the first one the way a lot of decisions are made. Lady Gaga's character is written as a template serial killer lover and nothing more even though she tries her best. So, naming that character Harley Quinn is such a disservice considering the history of that character.A lot of the movie takes place in a courtroom and jail. In both of these areas, there are just a lot of things that don't make sense. The cops and lawyers in this movie say and do things that don't make any sense considering what they actually want from doing it. The Joker says a lot of things that amount to nothing while in the first movie, all of his rants and comedy had a cinematic purpose.Considering they went for a musical, the movie had a lot of chances to be a lot more than it is even with its nonsensical paper-thin plot but they don't commit to it. And ending the movie abruptly like that, when the previous scene would've been enough just to reduce the drama of that event is so dumb. I mean, this is supposed to be a musical and such a big thing is presented in such a bland way?The choice to be a musical and the ending are supposed to be the polarizing aspects of the movie. But I enjoyed the musical aspect and the ending being so bland is more of the issue than the choice to do that considering how the rest of the movie went. Overall, it's technically well-made but has a weak script. It should've been utterly boring if not for the atmosphere that it sets for the movie. Nonetheless, such a bad sequel.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"The first Todd Phillips directed Joker film made an eye watering billion dollars at the box office. At the time making it the highest grossing R rated film of all time, a feat that has only recently been beaten by Deadpool and Wolverine.Despite the financial success of the first film it remained divisive in the court of public opinion. With that in mind when the negative reviews started coming out for this sequel I really wanted to disagree with them as I love the first film. Unfortunately however I simply can't defend this film.Carrying on from where the first film ended Joker is behind bars and back to being Arthur Fleck. As has been highly advertised he meets and falls in love with Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga) this gives him a temporary renewed sense of confidence. That is about all 'Lee' is in this film to do however. I can't help but feeling that it could have been any female love interest played by any other actor and the effect on the narrative would have been minimal. What a waste!So anyway the film casts Lady Gaga and so why not make it a musical. Whilst I respect filmmakers trying something different it's hard to commend the experiment when the result is as poor as this sequel is. Whilst unorthodox, I do see how this film could have been successful as a musical. Musicals however use the lyrics of the songs to advance the narrative. Todd Philips however tries to use the musical numbers to illustrate Arthur's mental state which not only serves to not advance the narrative but also doesn't really teach us anymore about his character that we didn't already know.When considering this films narrative as a whole I can't help but see it as an overly inflated epilogue of the first film. It doesn't really have any more to say in a social political sense and instead retreads a lot of the same ideas of the first film. Perhaps most frustratingly for me is that not only is this sequel a failure but it also feels like a bad stain on the reputation of the brilliant first film. Maybe this was intentional, perhaps this was Todd Phillips taking Warner Bros money and effectively running away. Regardless I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth and a feeling of utter disappointment.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"There was no payoff nor any sense of direction nor interest in any of the characters. The atmosphere and dark world building was the only thing that held up. There was one explosion in the entire movie and I was really hoping for more. That the movie would go in that direction, bridging the movie to the original story. But no, the very opposite happened. I had absolutely no expectations for this movie yet it somehow lowered the bar anyways. I was told about the musical numbers, so I was prepared for that. It felt like they exchanged the story for pointless singing. Maybe I need to rewatch it to understand, but I don't think I want to see it again.\",\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': '**Review of *Joker: Folie à Deux*: A Bold Sequel That Diverts Too Far from the Original**',\n",
       "    'Review': \"*Joker: Folie à Deux* presents a unique direction with impressive lighting that vividly showcases the characters' emotional depth. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a gripping performance as Arthur Fleck, again capturing the character's psychological unraveling. Lady Gaga's portrayal of Harleen Quinzel introduces a new dynamic to the story. However, her character felt more like an actor playing a role than an authentic extension of the Joker's world.The film takes bold risks by embracing elaborate musical numbers, a departure from the original's gritty realism. While visually striking, these sequences may feel jarring and unnecessary to some viewers. The sequel focuses on the twisted love story and psychological themes rather than continuing the grounded, societal critique that made the first *Joker* so impactful. In my view, these creative deviations, though daring, failed to add significant value to the franchise. The film feels like an unnecessary extension that strays too far from what made the original such a powerful standalone piece.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga are phenomenal actors and - largely to my surprise, in Phoenix\\'s case - fantastic vocalists. Gaga\\'s \"Harlequin\" album is definitely worth a listen, and the visuals in this film are overall pleasing and well composed. The ending definitely subverted expectations and left room for growth in the DC Cinematic Universe... so why didn\\'t I like it very much?My biggest problem with this film was the pacing. There were quite a few moments of quality: the courtroom testimonies of Puddles and Sophie Dumond, Phoenix\\'s musical numbers with the Arkham inmates, the \"reappearance\" of Joker in his own defense... but there was so much dead space between those moments it didn\\'t feel cohesive. Quite a few people are saying that - apart from her fantastic voice - this film wasted Harleen Quinzel as a character. I\\'m inclined to agree, and would even argue a step further. I believe that scenes expanding on her character could\\'ve remedied some of those massive pacing gaps and tied the story together in a more cohesive way.Last but not least, we really didn\\'t get much character development from Arthur Fleck. While I was watching, it was irritating. Retrospectively, I think it was intentional. (1) Arthur\\'s death demonstrates how frequently and thoroughly the American mental health and prison systems consistently fail the people they\\'re supposed to \"help.\" Of course Fleck didn\\'t grow, he never got any real psychological help. (2) It allowed for a new Joker to take the helm at the end of the film, cementing \"The Joker\" as more of an idea than a person. As an audience member, though... it feels like we\\'re building to a huge moment of character development and we never get it. Personally speaking, I expected Fleck to either overcome or succumb to the Joker alter ego, either one in spectacular fashion. Instead, he just... ended. Poetic in its own way? Yeah, maybe. Satisfying as an audience member? Absolutely not.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"I genuinely can't understand why people hate and are so upset about this movie. We knew it was going to be a sequel, a musical, co star Gaga etc. Etc. Having known all of this prior, I truly can't understand what people we're expecting? I set my bar for the movie extremely low. I'm not a comics or superhero movie fan, which is why the first Joker felt like a breath of fresh air. If I have to see another A list actor on steroids in tights I'm gonna gouge my eyes out. Go watch one of the billion superhero movies that follow cliche cookie cutter formulas, rehashing the same stories over and over ad nauseum if you don't like these interpretations? Like I said, I didn't have high expectations from the get go, I hate virtually all musicals I've ever seen. This seemed like an experiment. I respect director's taking risks, even if the final vision falls somewhat short. Keeps art alive. That being said, I think Joker: Folie à Deux slightly surpassed my (already very low) expectations as A MOVIE. The reality is that I will watch any movie JP is starring in, even if the movie seems bad. I watch Joaquin for what he brings to each performance, more than I generally care about the director or their movies. Joaquin brings a vulnerability, honesty, raw/realness to every performance and always impresses me with how he interprets roles. Was the movie amazing? Definitely not. Was it decently entertaining for a sequel that is a musical? Absolutely.I will admit that I kind of zoned out during most of the singing parts.... but the acting in between was great and the story was decent imo.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Given the slew of negative reviews, my expectations for *Joker 2* were rather low. However, in its defence I found it wasn't quite as dreadful as anticipated.First, let's talk positives: the cinematography effectively captured the grimness of Arkham Asylum. I found the slow-burning storyline intriguing. Although not much happens, the visual storytelling kept me engaged-at least until we hit the courtroom scenes.Now for the downsides. The film is peppered with random musical numbers that feel entirely out of place. It seems this turned into a vanity project for Lady Gaga, with Joaquin Phoenix's involvement coming off as delusional and egotistical. Some scenes were outright cringeworthy, with Phoenix looking visibly embarrassed while dancing in the dreary asylum. A few dream sequence musical numbers might have been tolerable, but this was overkill.The film's portrayal of the Joker's infatuation with Lee is another misstep. He comes across as old, tired, beaten, and weird. Lee doesn't appear crazy enough to be obsessed with him. Additionally, the courtroom scenes drag on unnecessarily. The oscillation between Joker's ego, Arthur Fleck's beaten demeanor, and the genius-crazy Joker is hard to believe.In summary, *Joker 2* is a disappointing sequel that attempts to be clever and unique but ends up being ridiculous and muddled.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'So, before watching this movie, I rewatched Joker (2019) and I loved it. It is one of my favuote DC movies ever. Possibly my 3rd fav. But it felt like a standalone to me. So I didn\\'t seem to care too much about potential sequals. But when I first saw the trailer scene of Joker dancing with Lady Gaga, I thought it looked awesome. Even though it was confirmed to be a muwsical, I was pretty open minded. The first 40 mins of this film is actually pretty good, and I was confuseed as to why people hated the film. Some musical scenes were decent. But as we got into the 2nd and 3rd act, I started to understand the HATE. It is so slow, messy and boring. The biggest joe of the film (no oun intended) is that it is so boring. HOW DO YOU MAKE A BORING FILM WITH TWO OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHARACTERS IN ALL OF DC? The middle act went on and on and I was BORED. The final act did capture my attention, but it all felt meaningless. While I do understand what Todd Phillips was trying to do with the ending, it falls flat on it\\'s face when the movie seems so unfocused. I didn\\'t care for the ending as I didn\\'t even enjoy the majority of the movie. Very underwhelming and a bit dissapointing. I don\\'t recommend wasting your time watching this. But if you are curious, then please, go check it out. Overall, I will rate it 5/10. It is a \"MEH\" Movie.',\n",

       "    'Review': '\"Joker:Folie a Deux\" is a sequel that they never really thought of making. Only after the vast popularity of \"Joker\" have they given it a thought of making a sequel. The thing is this movie doesn\\'t really connect. Its biggest issue is that at its core it doesn\\'t really know the story it wants to tell. Joaquin Phoenix returns as the titular character but there are moments here where he feels less grant than the original movie. Lady Gaga is criminally underused. Although they almost filmed it like a musical, Lady Gaga sings less than Phoenix. It also plays as romance,and sometimes as a court room drama. The truth is the movie is a little bit of all of those genres and that\\'s not bad. What is bad though is how they never really understood how to navigate all these genres to make a coherent story. The movie ends and you feel numb but you really have to try a lot to see how everything that happened falls in place in the story. The themes do come together at the end, but it should have been a more coherent storytelling. \"Joker:Folie a Deux\" is a long underwhelming sequel. It goes to show that Phillips\\' Joker was only good for what he already showed us before.',\n",

Now there's lots plots hole that story don't go anywhere.The acting couldn't save it, well received Joaquin Phoenix was same n good but better.Gaga like a Bradley Cooper Star is Born, but she play a fan girl, that couldn't act real, but hey it wasn't bad, the soundtrack were good that she sang, question was she involved in the score?There much the say.So conclude they should ve read classic or new story n till there making new, awesome move but making him a person, the ending was dumb.

       "    'Review': 'Co-written and directed by Todd Phillips, the movie centers around Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix), a failed comedian who is now incarcerated at Arkham State Hospital and waiting for a trial after committing a murder. There, he meets Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga), and they develop their relationship as the Joker and Harley Quinn.Warner Bros. Probably thought they were cooking something when they greenlit a sequel for 2019\\'s Joker, but instead, they give us more examples of why not every movie deserves a sequel, especially when the first one is obviously enough. I still remember at the time of its release, the ending had already sparked a conversation and many theories among the audience, and that\\'s it, there was no need to go much further than that.Well, the joke\\'s on me for being pumped about this unnecessary follow-up. It\\'s evident that Phillips wasn\\'t planning to make a second movie in the first place because Folie à Deux contradicts everything that happened in the previous one, the idea for a sequel is probably born out of demand from the studio, nothing else. That\\'s why whatever the message they are trying to say isn\\'t working, it made Arthur (Joker) like a completely two different person in this one. Arthur had so many things against him to fully embrace the Joker persona at the end, and the build-up to that moment is perfect, but here, he suddenly forgetting about things that \"made\" him before and, in the end, says he isn\\'t what people are saying because of uhh, moral conflict? (i don\\'t know, lmao).Lady Gaga did best with what was given to her even though all of her excellent performances were in the musical segments because she was doing what she\\'s good at....singing. The same goes for Phoenix; he isn\\'t as impressive as he was before. Their relationship is a real letdown with almost no development, they are only having fun when they\\'re signing. Some of the musical bits are good I even enjoyed it but the transition of the scene always throws me off and they\\'re making intense moments into nothing.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"I just finished watching Joker: Folie à Deux, and how should I put it? I love musicals, but they felt completely out of place in this movie. The shifts in tone were confusing, and one could even argue that they indirectly ruined the film. Phoenix's Oscar-worthy performance remains as extraordinary as ever, while Gaga, compared to her roles in A Star Is Born and House of Gucci, came across as a bit lackluster. But it's not her fault-the issue lies in how her character was written. Her singing ability is beyond doubt, her performance seemingly effortless, and her voice very moving, but in the musical scenes, Phoenix clearly couldn't match her.As a Batman fan, I couldn't feel any chemistry between Joker and Harley. Instead of Harley being the leading lady, it felt more like she was just a tool to drive the plot forward-and that plot was incredibly disappointing, especially if you loved the first film. The first movie showcased how a person from the bottom of society, bullied, oppressed, ridiculed, and tormented by various illnesses and childhood traumas, was slowly pushed into darkness and eventually descended into madness. In the second film, however, the focus was more on his confusion about himself and his uncertainty in facing the public's expectations. Sure, you managed to overthrow the city and start a revolution, but the crowd only idolized the symbol you represented. Once you take off the mask, no one cares about the real you. While the movie's message was still profound, the execution fell flat.The first movie, in my mind, was flawless, a 10/10 masterpiece. But this second one? I can only give it a 5/10. It was that bad and that disappointing, and I sincerely wish they had never made a sequel.That being said, I'm really glad I spent last weekend on a long road trip, looping Lady Gaga's latest album Harlequin at least ten times. It gave me some sense of connection to the musical elements in this film.\",\n",

It feels as if numerous scenes were cut, resulting in a fragmented narrative that fails to explore its themes of mental illness and love.Visually, while the film is striking, it relies too heavily on aesthetics without providing a compelling story to match.

Fleck is allowed to participate in the musical therapy class where he talks to Lee, who explains that she loved \\'The Joker\\' since seeing him in a TV movie about his actions and the pair begin a love affair. Fleck is torn between supporters who want to see \"The Joker\", and his lawyer Maryanne (Catherine Keener) trying to make a case for him avoiding the death penalty, for reasons of insanity.Not unlike the first film, \"Folie a Deux\" again engages in numerous fantasies and dream sequences allowing you to question which sections are actually happening and which are \"made up\". Because of that it\\'s open to endless interpretation and analysis. Personally, I don\\'t particularly buy the \"we must punish the people with whom the first film resonated, because they are the \\'wrong people\\'\" suggestion. If, for no other reason, than it\\'s produced by Warner Brothers who have already shown their willingness to take a completed movie and turn it into a vaulted tax write off. That argument gives the producers too much credit.I did feel like the musical numbers were disappointing. I\\'m not sure why, given the time, and money, to turn their fantasy dance numbers into almost anything - they\\'re all so low key. Lady Gaga particularly keeps things restrained, perhaps as if she (or the production) was concerned about blowing Phoenix away too much. It feels like a small film too, essentially restrained to only three or four real sets. The courtroom scenes never feel like they really get going and there\\'s no twist or reveals that stem from that.I haven\\'t revisited the first \"Joker\" film, since seeing it at the cinema and I can\\'t imagine that I\\'ll be back to this one again, but I never felt it was \"walking out\" bad - just dull.',\n",

Loved the first film. , even the Gary Giltter song with Arthur is coming down the stairs worked brilliantly. All in all very disappointing apart from the acting which is such a shame when you start by having a massive franchise to work with.\",\n",

Of course, we expected more, but in the first movie, they portrayed his life in a miserable way and developed the character in such a manner that he reached his peak, so to speak. This development allowed the audience to connect with him on a deeper level. Then, in the second one, they didn't continue with that idea; instead, they made him miserable again and had him die as such, which felt like a regression. On the other hand, I understand the musical aspect because it tried to convey the complex mind of the Joker, showcasing his struggles and inner turmoil through song and performance.\",\n",

And YES, unfortunately 5 stars is a justified rating. Not terribly bad, but nonetheless a failed sequel.The bad: let's forget about the songs for a moment, let's us only focus first on the spoken acting scenes. Are those any good? All the acting is done really well, BUT that doesnt make it an interesting, captivating or thrilling sequel, ON THE CONTRARY, the spoken acting scenes are incredibly BORING. Why? Because it's basically nothing more but a boring court room movie. NOTHING BUT BORING COURTROOM TALK. Who is gonna wanna watch that?!More bad: NOW let's focus on the songs. The songs aint bad by itself either. Joaquin Phoenix CAN really sing and he has got a dark rough edge to his voice which gives the songs a nice dark twist, BUT unfortunately the songs dont add anything to the core of the movie and the songs are not that good that they stand out as a musical. So it's NEITHER a great musical (at all), NOR is it a thrilling movie, (if yoiu would only judge it by the spoken acting scenes).It's a FLOP. I LOVED the original Joker movie and I am great fan of Joaquin Phoenix, but this sequel (howewer well acted and sung) is a complete NOTHINGBURGER. Totally void of any real thrill or true drama.

       "    'Review': \"After watching the first Joker movie I was slightly blown away. It was a genuine diamond in the rough of the absolute formulaic dross that Hollywood have been turfing out over the last few years. The writing was original. The performances were spot-on. And the direction was sublime. Not once was I bored watching the original.I wish I could say the same for the sequel.Firstly: let's address the elephant in the room - the musical numbers. I'm not a fan of musicals, but I have to say that I actually enjoyed the distraction here. Lady Ga Ga, whilst not being a great actress (in my opinion) was perfectly cast as Quinn. And she definitely shines during the singing and dancing elements. As does Phoenix. The fact that I enjoyed these moments is troubling to me, though, because far from being a distraction from the plot - which is usually what happens to me during musicals - they actually came as a welcome break from what was a puzzling movie.Why is Fleck now a wimp again? At the end of the first movie he had evolved into The Joker. He had embraced his insanity and flourished. In this movie he'd become timid again. Why? What purpose did it play to have him regress? It was confusing, and, unfortunately, took me completely out of the movie. Instead of focussing on what was happening, I found myself lamenting a wasted opportunity.I'm sure that there will be people who love this film. And I can actually understand why that is. It looks beautiful. Most of the performances are good. And it's obvious been made with love. To me, however, it's an absolutely pointless sequel; because instead of demonstrating character progression, it did the opposite.\",\n",

Even though many state Gaga was great, i would go on to say she wasn't even acting out any character, she was acting as herself.

       "    'Review': 'The original Joker has been categorized as a \"psychological thriller\" and this movie has been categorized as a \"musical psychological thriller.\" The theater listing categorizes the movie singularly as \"suspense.\" Let\\'s be clear. There is no mystery, suspense, or thriller here. And aside from brief acts of violence, there is no action. I agree with critics that call this a \"quasi-musical courtroom drama.\"Avoiding pre-release marketing, as I do, I had no idea I was in store for a musical. The movie \"boasts\" 15 musical numbers, oddly, only 4 less than West Side Story (1961). That said, the singing was intentionally fashioned to be \"unprofessional.\" So there\\'s that. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s singing voice sounds like Randy Newman on a bad day.To be fair, Phoenix delivers a tour-de-force performance as he did in the original. However, the feature length movie built out from it is a vapid house of cards with no true \"plot\" to speak of.The courtroom footage was dry and befuddling at best. And to say that Zazie Beetz \"reprises\" her role from the original movie is disingenuous as it\\'s no more than about 5 minutes of testimony.Phoenix is imprisoned for the ENTIRETY of the movie, and, inexplicably, Lady Gaga is seemingly allowed to come and go as she pleases.Most of the musical numbers are sung \"in fantasy\" and some seemingly (but not conclusively) \"out of fantasy.\"Frankly, then, the movie is not a satisfying musical or courtroom drama or thriller. It\\'s more akin to a clumsy campy misguided version of La La Land.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"So I'll start like most reviews I've seen for this film by starting with that i loved the first one. That was a superb slow burner of a film that built up to an amazing climax and was full of memorable scenes and quotes.Trying to pull it off twice was a tall order but I didn't quite expect it to go this way.The film is set two years after the first one with Arthur Fleck locked up and awaiting his trial and, while in there, meets Lee Quinn in a musical therapy group.The first flaw, for me, was that this really isn't much of a storyline to sustain a film well over two hours, it's just too long! It really does drag in parts.Secondly Todd Phillips can dress it up all he likes but this is definitely a musical. Now admittedly it isn't as bad as I thought. It's not like they're singing every two minutes and at first some of the musical scenes actually work but after a while they started to grate on me.The performances from everyone are superb except for Steve Coogan who makes a completely unnecessary appearance as Alan Partridge with an American accent.There's another brilliant film in here somewhere but it just gets too bogged down in its own self indulgence. The wacky opening scene was annoying and just added, like lots of other uneeded bits, to an already too long run time.I get where they were going with this at times, and it was almost clever, but it didn't quite come together for me but nice try anyway.I did get a kick out of characters, from the original, turning up in court to discuss how Arthur's behaviour affected them and I liked the use of a couple of locations from the first film.Sadly it just fails to build on the first film. There's no stand out moments, like Joker dancing down the steps outside his apartment or the wonderful dialogue on The Murray Franklin Show, you almost feel like it's going to happen and then it falls flat.Despite all that in a year full of let down sequels this, at least, wasn't completely terrible. I will definitely give it another watch to see how it works without my expectations up. But for now I shall sit on the fence and say that despite the fact it wasn't brilliant it also wasn't quite as bad as feared by early negative reviews so it's middle diddle for Joker Folie a Deux with a 5/10.\",\n",

Sadly it just drags. I liked most of the musical sequences, but felt the When The Saints Go Marching In Segment felt awkward, contrived snd unnecessary. I liked the sad brutal ending, and left me feeling more satisfied with the movie. It was suitably bleak, and gave the movie depth.

Spoilers past this point:One of the prison guards(the Irish one) choked out the one crazy dude that looks like the eyebrows dude from We're The Millers.

At one point, I found myself hoping they would stop singing altogether.The plot felt a bit disconnected. I couldn't really see the link to the first film, and I'm still unsure if it's meant to connect at all. For a sequel, you'd expect some continuity, but that didn't come through for me.The biggest disappointment, in my opinion, was the underuse of Lady Gaga's potential in the role of Harley Quinn. In the trailers, she seemed to fully embody the character, looking freaky and chaotic. However, in the film, she appears almost like a regular person most of the time, and I felt they didn't put enough effort into developing her character. Ironically, she seemed more like Harley Quinn while promoting the film than she did in the movie itself. I also noticed that some of the scenes featured in the trailers were absent from the final cut of the film.Overall, I wouldn't say it was a complete failure due to the strong cast, solid acting, and impressive cinematography, but the plot had so much more potential and could have been significantly better.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Regardless of your thoughts on Joker (2019), one thing that can be agreed on is that it did not need a sequel. But, unfortunately for everyone, money talks and its clear WB wanted a sequel. And so here we are, with an unnecessary sequel to a decent first movie which ended fairly well. What we have now is a film desperate to right the perceived wrongs of the first, a bloated, meandering sequel that ultimately has nothing to say.To start with the positives, and there are a few, the acting in this film is great. I was surprised that Joaquin Phoenix still gave it his all, when he could have easily phoned it in. Lady Gaga was also excellent as Lee Quinn (that's her name) and the pair have solid chemistry on-screen. The film is also well-shot, maintaining the aesthetic of the original film and the score is pretty solid, although it reuses a lot of the first film's score. An aspect that I wasn't expecting to like was in fact the musical numbers. Some are actually quite solid and I can see the potential in making this a musical. It does play well into the Joker's psyche. It is then a real shame that the execution is all over the place with very few of the numbers truly contributing to the overall film and most are clearly there to distract from the pacing, plot and writing.This film is pretty slow, and not a lot happens. At times it feels incredibly repetitive, with a lot of scenes feeling redundant and so often a musical number is sprinkled into a conversation just to make it appear interesting. The film lacks a strong POV, constantly switching between Arthur and Lee, when I personally think having Lee be the POV would have made the film stronger. The character work is also questionable, especially when it comes to Arthur. It seems Todd Phillips disliked how many people enjoyed Arthur's descent into madness and thus decided to regress him back, presenting The Joker as merely a persona, even though the first film ends with him fully giving in. By the end, I am not even sure what the point is anymore. I can see the idea, but it is poorly executed with little attention given to it. What frustrates me most is that this film is ripe with potential, but it squanders nearly all of it which leaves this film feeling half assed and empty in the writing department.Overall, this film just doesn't need to exist. It reduces any significance the first one had, whilst adding nothing new itself. It is constantly on the cusp of something potentially great, but it never commits. It is a shame, because there is great potential here, and everyone (barring the writers) seem to be giving it their all. A film that will leave you with a blank expression once its all said and done.\",\n",

Everything Joker did well, Joker 2 failed.Harvey Dent was incredibly lame, so much so that to call him a cameo would be a massive overstatement. His character just falls flat, and he just feels like an incredibly generic district attorney, it's kind of insulting to refer to his character as Harvey Dent.Every scene in the original Joker was better than this film, there's only 1 scene in that could compare, and that was when Mr puddles was being cross examined by the Joker. It's so tense, and so uncomfortable and really shows just how far gone Arthur Fleck isEasily the worst aspect of this film, is the complete deconstruction of Arthur Fleck. This films effectively retconns the events of the last film, and takes you back to where he started. There's pretty much no point to this filmAnd don't get me started on the ending........\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"My review of Joker is that it felt a bit short and didn't cover an extensive range of material. The pacing was slow, and the film was mostly confined to just two main settings: the prison and the courtroom. However, what I appreciated about the movie was the insight it gave into the Joker's mind. It was fascinating to see how his past experiences shaped him into the person he became.While Joker felt limited in scope with its slow pace and confined settings, it excelled in exploring the psychology of the character. The deep dive into the Joker's troubled mind and the events that shaped him was captivating. We got a glimpse of his transformation, from his traumatic past to the circumstances that led to his current state. The movie didn't rely on action or numerous locations to make its impact; instead, it focused on the psychological unraveling of the Joker, which made for a thought-provoking experience. The minimalistic approach in storytelling allowed the audience to fully absorb the complexity of his character.\",\n",

The first movie was a gritty, intense psychological thriller that explored complex themes of mental illness and societal breakdown. How much better would it have been to experience the same unsettling atmosphere and witness Arthur Fleck's descent into chaos?I guess that's what many fans were anticipating.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker (2019) was one of the most iconic and unique takes on the character. He was not a calculating mastermind, nor the clown prince of crime. He was only a severely, mentally ill, and nihilistic individual who inspires crime and anarchy because he views this as the answer to a broken system that failed him and many others.He is sick with a neurologic condition of uncontrollable laughter, which sometimes physically hurts him if he goes against it. Making his transformation into the murderous Joker, and fully embracing this uncontrollable laugh - hauntingly beautiful.Before Deadpool & Wolverine (2024), Joker (2019) was the highest grossing R-Rated film of all time, and earned Joaquin Phoenix his Best Actor academy award. His Joker skyrocketed into a level of iconography that rivaled even Heath Ledger\\'s portrayal - Everyone seemingly wore his costume on Halloween that year and it sparked numerous debates on portrayals of mental health and the ills of society.The film never needed a sequel. It was a one-shot story. But it grossed a billion dollars, and this is Hollywood. So, enter Folie à Deux.The sequel introduces Harleen \"Lee\" Quinzel. Initially believed to be a fellow psychiatric inmate, she is revealed to be a psychiatry student obsessed with the mentally ill. She confines herself in asylums because she wishes to be away from her rich, likely boring, life. She falls for Joker, or at least the idea of him, and wishes to free him from the asylum. This version of Harley is unique, as she is the manipulator.While Arthur Fleck is being rehabilitated and awaiting trial for his murders, he is being forced to comply with the notion that he is not \"Joker\". It\\'s a made-up personality that acted in self-defense against his traumatic experiences and multiple life endangerment. His lawyer directs him to plead insanity to avoid the death penalty, while Lee encourages him into riding along this facade so once he is free - he can resume his true self as Joker with Harley Quinn by his side.This was a simple enough concept, but was not executed properly.Instead, the narrative went through all sorts of directions. Arthur sometimes sings, sometimes it\\'s Lee singing, other times he imagines singing with Lee as his Joker persona and wakes back up to his disappointingly frail real-self. This was unnecessary, but since it was already decided the film will be a musical, it surprisingly does not commit to it as well. These made the song numbers feel out of place.To be fair, Lady Gaga who plays Lee, despite literally bursting into song every time she\\'s on screen still felt under-utilized. Remember she is an Academy Award Nominee for Best Actress yet she was given so little avenue to showcase that skill. What is even more frustrating is that her Harley Quinn was unique, it was evil attracted to evil. She had all the chances to become an icon herself with a take different enough to contrast Margot Robbie\\'s version.Otherwise, the film also pointlessly subverts its predecessor. Firstly, it backpedals on the established ending that Arthur Fleck was gone, there was only the devil that is Joker. Instead, Arthur Fleck is back and Joker is reduced into a delusion, a sick man\\'s fantasy, another personality. Despite this being the actual point of his lawyer in order to save him from the electric chair, Arthur owns up to the murders as himself at the end, not as the Joker - to everybody\\'s disappointment.And while there\\'s some meta moments scattered throughout the film; the context only made it much worse. For example - Lee and Joker, in one of Arthur\\'s fantasy musicals, told him that it seems like \"they are not giving the audience what they want\" and should do so. In the end we got nothing but half-baked musicals, half-baked courtroom drama, half-baked psychological thriller - and still not what the audience wanted, an actual Joker film like the first one.Interesting enough, Arthur\\'s last interaction with Lee involved him asking her to stop singing. While the audience likely also feel the same, it\\'s not some saving grace of a dialogue that can forgive the 16 songs scattered in the film. The ending also managed to shoehorn a popular fan theory that Arthur Fleck only inspired the real Joker later on - but this was also poorly executed with zero build up.Finally, If the goal of the film was to subvert expectations and turn people who previously worshipped the Joker against him, if the goal was to disappoint both Quinn in-film and the viewer then it was successful. But it failed to be a good and entertaining movie.Nevertheless, if we have to say something good about it, its Joaquin Phoenix\\'s and Lady Gaga\\'s commitment to their roles, wasted only by poor execution of the chosen narrative. The set pieces, cinematography, the soundtrack, still top notch - but it\\'s buried beneath the jarringly pointless plot.Our first, and hopefully our only disappointment among our anticipated films this 2024.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'What you\\'ve heard is true. Joker: Folie à Deux is not good. But my reasons for not liking it, I think, are different from why most people don\\'t like it. Let me be clear, I don\\'t fault this movie for trying something new. I don\\'t fault it for taking big risks. I don\\'t fault it for directly challenging what made the first film so iconic. What frustrates me is how half-baked and half-assed everything is. For a film with such daring ideas, Todd Phillips clearly doesn\\'t have the courage of his convictions to follow through with any of them. The passion that should drive this film is missing entirely. Lazy is the best word to describe it.Arthur Fleck is in Arkham Asylum, awaiting trial. He\\'s beaten and run ragged by a thuggish gang of prison guards. One day, he meets Harley Quinn during a session of \"musical therapy\" and Harley falls madly in love with him. As it turns out, she\\'s attracted to the dangerous celebrity he\\'s become. Think of the psychotic love notes that real-life serial killers get in prison, and you have what this film is sort of touching upon. Since they both love to sing, they sing... and they sing... and they never stop singing. Yes, it\\'s a musical. A big jukebox musical, complete with choreographed dance numbers.I reiterate, I\\'m not against the concept of making this a musical. But it\\'s how they go about it here that\\'s so disingenuous and cynical. If Arthur and Harley sang only to themselves, with no orchestra backing them up, it would\\'ve been akin to the behavior of real-life psychopaths. Think of the Charles Manson prison interviews from the 1980s. But instead, it\\'s nothing more than an excuse to hear Lady Gaga belt out a few show tunes for the soundtrack.Lady Gaga is a fine actress, and an even finer singer, but Todd Phillips creates a version of Harley Quinn that gives her absolutely nothing to work with. She does not match Arthur\\'s mental illness in any way. She isn\\'t convincing as a person who would realistically be locked away in an asylum. You genuinely feel how cheaply she\\'s used to sell tickets here.We\\'re slogging along with this film for the greater part of two hours. But then, there\\'s the last 20 minutes. This, in my view, is where the greatest concepts and risks of the film are realized. The first Joker movie thrived as a spectacle that held a mirror to a decimated American society, obsessed with lone-wolf killers and their pathetic, selfish reasons for committing their atrocious crimes. This film wants to take that and smash it into a thousand pieces. Todd Phillips may be telling us that he never wanted Joker to be such a controversial film in the first place. I get the sense that not only is he unhappy to have made a sequel, but he\\'s pissed at how most of us interpreted it. Maybe it\\'s because I had lost so much patience by the film\\'s end, but I found the shocking conclusion to be cathartic and rewarding. As a microcosm of how we should view these horrible people as a society, it\\'s even more satisfying.I realize that everyone\\'s take on this film will be vastly different. That\\'s a great thing. Even bad films should get people talking. It\\'s a shame that that bad film is a sequel to Joker.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Combining movie genres can be tricky business. When the mix is right, the outcome can be truly impressive, but, when it\\'s off, it can spell cinematic disaster. In the case of this long-awaited sequel to the 2019 box office and critically acclaimed success, unfortunately, the result is closer to the latter than the former. Picking up where the protagonist\\'s story left off, this saga about charismatic villain Arthur Fleck (a.k.a., the Joker) (Joaquin Phoenix) finds him in prison awaiting trial for his string of heinous crimes. Most of the picture\\'s first half takes place here, an unlikely venue for Arthur meeting the love of his life, the psychopathic Lee Quinzel (a.k.a., Harley Quinn) (Lady Gaga), who diligently stands by her man when he eventually goes to court, the primary focus of the film\\'s second half. So, at this point, the picture is already part prison film, part courtroom drama and part dark romance. But, if that weren\\'t enough, writer-director Todd Phillips draws upon a fourth genre - musicals - to make the mix even more overstuffed (but, hey, if you\\'ve got a talent like Lady Gaga at your disposal, why not, right?). The result is a convoluted, overlong, often-uninteresting offering that\\'s heavy on style but weak on substance and not especially interesting. Admittedly, the performances of the two leads and many of the supporting players (Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener and Steve Coogan in particular) are quite good, doing a more than commendable job of making this material look far better than it actually is. In addition, stylistically speaking, the picture is terrific when it comes to its production design, costuming and cinematography. And the soundtrack is great, too, including an array of superbly chosen standards to complement the narrative (even if there are a few too many selections). But these strengths by themselves aren\\'t enough to make a good picture overall; what\\'s stuck in between these elements feels more like filler than substance, and that\\'s where the movie falls apart. In my view, \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" isn\\'t as resoundingly awful as many reviewers have made it out to be in light of its artistic and aesthetic accomplishments, but that doesn\\'t mean this release is not without its share of problems, most notably in the dreadful writing and mishandled film editing. This is one of those pictures where you get to the end and are likely to heave a heavy \"Ho hum, so what?\" And that\\'s regrettable, given that the character and this picture\\'s predecessor both deserved better than what this follow-up has to offer. If you haven\\'t seen this yet, you might be better off sticking to the picture\\'s genuinely stellar trailer, as that\\'s ultimately much better than most of what\\'s found in this clunky 2:18:00 release.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Whoever came up with the script of this film has a huge misunderstanding about musical movies. Take La La Land for example, every single song bears a special significance in the storytelling like setting up the mood, showing character development, or transitioning between plotlines. You can't just throw in a random song in the middle of the scene and use it to symbolize the Joker's fantasy every time; it simply messes with the sleep-inducing pacing of the already prolonged asylum or courtroom segments.I like the discussion of idolizing evil, which mirrors the frantic admiration of Joker in reality by few, sometimes in the form of violence. This is not right of course, but goddamn it why make the fictional movie so depressing? If we can't get some release in entertainment why would anyone go to a theater on the weekends? Tell you a joke, the Joker is denied existence and purpose in his own movie!The only thing good is Phoenix's performance combined with the close-ups and the lighting, which is meaningless in the face of the story's failure.Folie a Deuz not only excretes on what Joker (2019) stood for but does so in a slow, painful, diarrheal way.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I waited 5 years, the first movie is a masterpiece for me and among my top 10-15 favorite films; everything about this movie, from its name to its budget, gave me hope, but the result is heartbreaking.I don't even know where to start criticizing it, the movie is so lacking that I can't express it, they seem to have forgotten to put the script together. The sections of the film are very disconnected from each other. It feels like a bunch of random scenes.Let me first address the thing that everyone is stuck on-the musical choice. To be honest, I was excited at first because they were trying something different. But as I saw in the film, even though the production and the shooting of the scenes were very high quality, it completely ruined the pacing of the film. I mean, musical scenes are fine, but there are too many. At least 5 or 6 times, there are unnecessary songs, and as a viewer, you lose connection with the entire movie.The acting was still very solid. Joaquin Phoenix once again proves he is a phenomenal actor. Lady Gaga also delivers a decent performance. But all the flaws go back to the script. There are such absurd choices in the script, especially in the last thirty minutes, it gets nonsensical.Joker suddenly turning back into Arthur, Harley's character not being fleshed out at all, the reason for the explosion at the end being unclear, the idea of Joker inspiring new Jokers not being well-founded, and the courtroom scenes being frequent yet failing to be a proper legal drama are all major missteps in my opinion.If they were going to put in so many courtroom scenes, they should have built the movie around that. Along with a heavy drama effect, adding a touch of musical elements could have resulted in a more coherent film, but it was very insufficient.The supporting characters feel very shallow, and in a 2-hour 18-minute movie, having the supporting characters feel this superficial takes away from the visuals, palette, and quality; when you leave the cinema, the mediocre script is all that remains in your mind.Another major flaw of the film, in my opinion, is that all the music gives off the same feeling. It's like Joaquin and Lady Gaga made an album of ten songs at the same tempo; by the third song, it became unimpactful and boring. This also made the film ultimately ordinary.I still don't understand why Harley says she's pregnant. It has no necessity or contribution to the script, and the sex scene that leads to it is also pointless and placed awkwardly in the story. It's quite funny and painful that they think the lack of motherhood and motherly love can be resolved by her saying 'I'm pregnant.'The worst part is, in my opinion, the wrong choice of title. There's no event that reflects the concept of 'Folie à Deux' for it to be about shared madness. Harley is shown as a straightforward person who lies and tries to deceive; I never got the sense that she was crazy.Even though there are scenes of beatings and partial assault-rape, the pacing is so ruined that after a point, the emotional depth and intensity are lost. Believe me, I am very sad.To sum up, the efforts of Phoenix, Lawrence Sher (cinematographer), and everyone working on makeup and visuals have been killed by a weird experiment alongside a plot full of holes. One of the most mediocre sequels I've watched in a long time.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker 2 is a massive disappointment when compared to the brilliance of the first film. The decision to turn what was initially a dark, psychological character study into a musical is baffling and completely undermines the tone that made the original so powerful. The musical numbers feel out of place and detract from the raw, gritty world that was built in Joker 1. What's even worse is that the spotlight shifts almost entirely from the Joker himself to Lady Gaga, making it feel less like a Joker movie and more like a Lady Gaga showcase.In Joker 1, there was a subtle yet significant tie to the larger Batman universe, with references to Bruce Wayne and Gotham City that added depth and context to Arthur Fleck's descent into madness. However, Joker 2 abandons all of that, losing any connection to the broader world that could have made the story more meaningful. The film's narrative becomes so centered on Gaga's character that it might as well have been titled Lady Gaga, not Joker.The only saving grace of this movie is Joaquin Phoenix's incredible performance as the Joker. His portrayal is once again mesmerizing, showing the tortured and chaotic nature of the character. But even Phoenix's brilliance can't save a film that feels disjointed, tonally confused, and lacking the substance that made the first one so iconic.\",\n",

Especially when talking about mental health disorders. The portrayal of the disorder could have gone deeper. The failings of the system were grazed over. The ball was dropped in several scenes. However, the acting was phenomenal. Both Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga did their best with what they were given. Unfortunately, the storyline just didn't hold up. The musical additions made sense but went on for far too long. It felt like fluff and didn't really add anything to the film. It just left much to be desired and they should have left well enough alone with the first film.\",\n",

The saints go marching in was corny . I like the perspective of fleck's fantasy holding his reality...so i get the direction lines are blurred if you read novels (especially the killing joke ) this narrative made sense . Lady gaga's lee character i liked it wasn't the maggot robbie classic barely that we all love ..... this one was different which the abuse storyline was finally used ... to be honest i don't understand why people hated it, everyone complained about the suicide squad that there wasn't that element displayed in the joker harlequin dynamic.... now we have it and y'all complaining ? ..... this felt like a toxic environment for the two..... buuuuuut on the other hand joker's character fell flat after the court explosion....he went back to being the same person in part one .... but now less out of his mind and going back to reality....the final scene of him and lee , she's over the joker due to his courtroom speech, she dips , i thought for sure he was gonna kill lee and play out the fantasy but no .... and to top it off he he dies just like murray in part one ( which i seen coming ) . He becomes the punchline of his old joke ... the end made me mad , it's the joker yes i wasn't expecting him to be the mastermind or the clown prince of crime ... but shit we go through this whole emotional roller coaster just to go back to the start and die? Like i would've been fine with part one. I would've loved the movie if he slipped so far from reality he goes back into musical number him fully losing the act of reality . But no we go back to the character we started from in part one .... disappointing.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'This was painful at times. Lady Gaga plays a great Harley no doubt. Joaquin\\'s chemistry with her is visible. Yet throughout the movie they build dark tension and suspense (just like the first movie) for it to be ruined like nails on a chalk board by a song. It kills everything. Pull all that out and replace it with the original instrumental music and you\\'ve instantly improved the movie x5. Most of the big events happen inside Jokers delusions which gives no meaning to anything you have just watched. The ending 2 scenes also felt so rushed after everything. They build this whole court scene up and up and then I think they realised they have to try end this some how and pulled the most random thing out the hat and thought \"yep that\\'ll do.\"If they just stuck with the tension and suspense the original Joker was known for and just let the scene sit in silence rather than some how evolve in to a sing song that brings you out of any emotion the scene worked on giving you it would of been a great watch.',\n",

The cinematography is excellent, the actors give it their all and mostly deliver excellent performances.However no matter how much I wanted to like it just felt overly long and in a way self absorbed. I get it Arthur never was the \"true\" Joker and \"just\" the inspiration. He never mattered as a person and will never matter. No matter how much he struggles and whatever he does he will never be seen as who he is. Ok - great. I like that premise. Which was quite clear after the first film and abundantly clear after 20 minutes or so into this one.Personally I also think that idea that only a true psychopath could be the actual Joker and society could never create it by indifference and the treatment it provides to a weak soul is just too politically correct: everyone can relax again because no matter how you treat people is fine, they are either to irrelevant too matter, are like yourself or have been psychopaths all along so you didn\\'t do anything. Move along - nothing to see here and go back to your usual ways.It\\'s just that, what were two movies by now then about all along?Beautiful to watch, just as irrelevant story wise as the existence of it\\'s main protagonist.',\n",

The problem is, and this is the biggest oversight in Phillips\\'s way of thinking, that audiences worldwide\\nchose Arthur as their new Joker.The idea of switching his creation for Christopher Nolan\\'s - and let\\'s not go around the bush, the Psychopath who ends Arthur\\'s life at the end of this film is none other than Heath Ledger\\'s Joker,\\nis both clever and dumb. First, it makes absolutely no sense when we try to understand both timelines; Phillip\\'s Joker takes place back in the 1980s while Nolan\\'s Joker is thriving in the early 2000s,\\nand second minimizes completely Arthur\\'s journey leaving him as the pathetic disappointment that inspired the real Clown Prince of Crime.This also means that Ledger\\'s Joker was in his mid 40s??This opens the possibility of a third chapter, that according to Phillips will never happen; at least not with him as Director, where Harley Quinn returns to Arkham as the Psychiatrist she truly is\\nafter finding out that Arthur was slain by the new Joker - who is everything she wanted Arthur to be, but couldn\\'t.If instead of musical numbers, and slowly than watching paint dry sequences, this film would\\'ve included that ending - the ending where Harley meets Nolan\\'s Joker and their \"Folie à Deux\"\\nconnects this film could\\'ve been something truly special.At least to me.Unfortunately, we got this half-cooked thing that feels like a mockery, I think unintentionally, of what should remain as a film classic; 2019 Joker.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Who would have thought that it would turn out so badly and uninteresting.It is clear that a sequel was not needed, but it was possible to come up with something interesting with such a basis...The Joker sits in a mental hospital for a third of the film. The main part of the film is in court, where his case is being heard. It's so bad that all this listening is essentially a retelling of 1 movie.Lady Gaga's line is my homage. No, of course she's a woman at least where, and she can play, but she's only needed here so that, well, look at Harley Quinn, well, you see, there's a Joker, there's her. There are kisses, sex in the camera and dance song numbers.Music outside of musical numbers is either something inexpressive or music from part 1. THANK YOU!IT'S A MUSICAL.The reviews wrote that they were shot for no clear reason and slow down the pace. That's exactly how it is. There is nothing interesting in them and they are only needed to show the love of the characters. Is there an end to this venture? Well, the Joker says that he is not a Joker (madness for two is not about a couple in love and what they will do when the jockey gets out, but about the fact that they are trying to justify the jockey based on his split personality)Also in the movie there is 1 cool unexpected explosion of the court followed by the escape of the Joker. He meets Harley and says he loves her and she's like that... Well, you're not a Joker, you're Arthur Fleck, this one, I'm not going to have children with you, and in general you're not a cool guy.There is no humor in the film, but there is the rape of the Joker. ISN'T THAT ENOUGH FOR YOU?! Well, then keep another joke.In the end, the Joker is simply killed by a clinic patient, having previously told him a joke that is inspired by the scene with Murray from part 1.What else can be highlighted? It's probably nothing.It's meaningless, it's not going anywhere, it just exists. Here's a movie like that.To be honest, before the final, it was still possible to justify it somehow and concentrate on something good, but this final...Bad. Very bad. I recommend Todd Phillips to return back to the comedy genre. His first film in the form of the Joker was a success in every sense, and after such a collapse as a sequel, it's time and honor to know.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'This movie is the definition of a mixed bag. I personally liked the first movie a lot, even though I don\\'t rewatch it much I still go back to a lot of the big scenes on Youtube. I was excited for this...BUT it is a very very messy movie. Before I get into the nitty gritty, I cannot recommend this movie to anyone. This is because I was very open to whatever this movie had to offer (I like musicals), but I thought it was eh. But the 99% of other people in the theatre were booing whenever Arthur sung, and you could feel the patience draining from the theatre as the movie went on. All in all it has all these ideas and slaps them on the wall and only half of them stick. Now for the details...The positives:\\nI thought the acting, cinematography, score, and first act was really good. Everyone performs very well even if they aren\\'t given the best material. The first act sets up this dream state of Arthur and his run in with Harley Quinn at the asylum, and even the musical aspect was good. It made me think \"why all the bad reviews\" - then I sat through the rest of the movie.Negatives:\\nOh boy. There is so much that I will rapid fire. Harley Quinn is basically not in this film. There are so few scenes with her its a shame, and really takes away from the ending of this film that tries to be so thought provoking. 90% of her scenes are just her singing, and the songs never go past the idea of her being in love. Second, it did not need to be a musical. While even I liked some of the songs, most of the time they show Arthurs fantasys. Thats all it does actually, every time. So besides one or two which actually got that point across, they were not needed. Thirdly, you have probably heard the 2nd act and on is a courtroom drama (for the most part). Yeah, it gets very very dull and overstays its welcome. It is not the most interesting court drama because the witnesses really have nothing new to say besides a few lines. It isn\\'t shot very well, and there was really only one scene I liked (and it was for the wrong reasons). Lets say Joker does a accent while in the courtroom, and it was quite funny. To me.Major Spoiler Section!More Negatives:\\nThe ending is okay on paper, but really not good in execution. Spoiler alert, but Arthur is killed by the \"real\" comic book joker. This is because Arthur says in the courtroom that he never was Joker and its all an act. First of all, he just says this with little to no leadup in any of the other scenes. I never felt for one moment this is where it could be leading, which is a bad thing in this case. Because, Harley Quinn hates him now and he gets murdered. I am fine with Arthur dying, but the whole reason behind it is just not executed well. He just vents to the jury which makes it seem they took about 5 minutes to write the scene. I don\\'t want to talk about this movie anymore, I\\'m getting bored just by thinking about it. All in all, it\\'s like two writers just switched off writing this thing. One good writer, and one bad - and they never looked at the others pages. All in all, a complete mess.',\n",

It is a disservice to both Phoenix's stellar portrayal of insanity and Gaga's musical talent. It is much too self-serious and heavy-handed, well overshooting its mark. People in the theater were audibly groaning or laughing at the breathy, cringe-worthy, and overlong music intermissions which detract from the impact that a better handling of the movie's themes of duality may have had. Overall, the film wavers between mediocre and downright bad; disappointing may be an appropriate word for it, because the leads could have done wonders with a proper script which better handled its sensitive themes.\",\n",

Manipulation to his best by the director.Great performances as expected and it's a very believable story in the Joker world that's what matters, don't go away from what he his. Ofc this isn't any build up to a crazy Batman universe so you need to see this as a musical and with some understanding of who is the Joker, if you can't see the movie thinking you're in his feet's but you're just there to consume wathever is in front of you then it's not worth.For the fans of the Joker I think it's a great movie, for people that don't have any idea of who he his or just want some crazy action like its usual in super heroes movies, don't waste time.\",\n",

Now that I've seen it, I'm still processing how I feel.I'll start with the musical aspect. I'm not a fan of musicals, and while this movie didn't change my opinion, it didn't bother me as much as I expected. The musical numbers felt integrated into the story, but they didn't elevate the experience for me either. And there weren't as many musical moments as I feared.Visually, Folie à Deux is just as stunning as the first movie. Todd Phillips once again proves he knows how to create beautiful, immersive sets and craft visually memorable scenes. The film's aesthetic is one of its strongest elements.Joaquin Phoenix remains fantastic as Arthur Fleck. His performance continues to be a highlight, and even though I didn't love certain aspects of the story, he fully embodies the character once again. However, one thing that bothered me throughout the movie was that Arthur's character arc didn't feel like it moved forward. Instead, the film seemed more focused on giving us a retrospective look at Arthur, almost trying to reverse or undermine the progress of his journey from the first movie. Maybe trying to hard to antagonize certain aspects of the audience who really liked the first one.Then there's Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn. While she's undoubtedly talented and adds to the plot, her character felt underutilized and a bit forgettable. She has the voice for the musical moments, but Harley herself isn't fully fleshed out, which left me wanting more from her portrayal.The film's ending also left me a bit infuriated. I personally think the movie would have been better if it had ended about 10 minutes earlier. The ending we got really made the first two hours seem rather pointless.Overall, Folie à Deux isn't as bad as some people say, but the first movie is miles ahead of this one. It is thought-provoking, and either way, whether you thought it was good or bad, you will be passionate about your feelings about it. But the sequel didn't capture the same magic, and by the end, I think it would have been better if Joker hadn't gotten a second movie at all.\",\n",

It's not the same vibe as 'The Joker' at all, which is frustrating because I was expecting something much darker and more psychological. Instead, it feels like a watered-down version of the Joker we were previously introduced to. I had hoped that, at the very least, the entire plot would be a clever, mind-bending narrative, maybe even a story unfolding within the Joker's own twisted mind. That would've made sense for the character! But no, it wasn't even that. It just felt flat and uninspired.I ended up giving it a 5 out of 10 purely because Joaquin Phoenix's acting remains superb. As always, he throws himself into the role with intensity and skill, but even his brilliance couldn't save this film. The script was weak, the execution lacked cohesion, and, above all, the ending was absolutely disappointing. It left me feeling empty, as if the buildup throughout the movie led nowhere.

Really poor character developement for Harley Queen as she never becomes the actual Harley Queen . Also the repeatabily of the scenes in jail is just boring and it adds-up to the already exosting songs . To add up this movie is not about the Joker . Arthur becomes Joker only for a couple of scenes and the switch between Arthur\\'s two characters is too steep . To be honest though the \"secret\" meanings of the movie are good and delivered superbly . For me the only people that should see this movie are the ones that havent seen the first one although I would suggest watching the first one instead . In conclusion the movie is too long and it comes poor compared to the original movie with the only thing that makes it worth watching being the incredible acting of Joaquin Phoenix and the remarkable filming .',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Peanut Butter is good, and mayo has its place. Would you put them together?No. Yet this Joker movie swirled with a musical comes off like a peanut butter mayo sandwich.What did I expect? A worthy sequel to a Billion dollar Oscar winning film. What did I get? An arty drunken miscalculation by someone who obviously didn\\'t want this to simply be a chapter deux. Todd Phillips went rogue, and it didn\\'t work.What went wrong?1. The script summary is 1 line long: Joker is on trial and things go wrong. Madame Web had more action than this. Nothing much ever happens here. It was not \"Joker chaos\" but rather infinity \"Joker discussions.\" And what about the big surprise? There isn\\'t one.2. Harley - I love Lady Gaga\\'s acting. I firmly believe she will win an Oscar as some point. But instead of letting her melt into Harley Quinn, they sprinkled a few Harley elements here and there and just had Lady Gaga be Lady Gaga. What. A. Miss.3. Tone - the musical interludes robbed the whole thing of a sense of foreboding. The only thing I feared in the movie was another song and dance coming. Don\\'t get me wrong. I love musicals when they make sense. But I ain\\'t lining up for \"7 Brides for 7 Dead Brothers.\"\\n4. The ending - as a lover of Film Noir I am perfectly okay if movies don\\'t end neatly with a bow. However, ending with a moaned whimper of comeuppance rather than a blaze of glory was a choice. A wrong one.Sadly, this is a Gotham story without a Batman. No one is coming to save this.4.5 out of 10.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'I don\\'t like musicals, never have. I don\\'t like the music and I don\\'t like that everything\\'s always so incredibly over the top happy, I don\\'t like that apparently everyone always knows all the songs and the dance moves and they just drop everything to ... sing and dance, almost as if their lives depended on it (this might make a fun horror movie). So when I heard that the sequel to \"Joker\" would be a musical, I was very disappointed. In the end I still watched it because I really enjoyed the first movie and a sequel, even a musical sequel, couldn\\'t be that bad, right?I\\'ve read complaints about the movie not using original songs. My reply to those: Originals songs wouldn\\'t have worked. The songs in \"Folie à Deux\" actually have a point - I still didn\\'t like them (not a genre of music I enjoy) but they actually fit the overall tone - without spoiling anything, this really is the Joker we know from the first movie but he\\'s singing - and they never felt disruptive, which sets the movie apart from the few other musicals I\\'ve seen (glimpses of). There\\'s even a scene that I enjoyed (Joker and the courtroom #1).The image in IMAX was great (volume warning for the sentence!), Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga do a good job and while the sequel is sadly a lot tamer than the first one, it\\'s still not even close to PG-13. So why the bad rating (I guess you could see 5 stars as a neutral rating)?Do you remember the TV shows from the late 2000s and early 2010s? 20+ episodes per season, 20-40 minutes each. Eventually they couldn\\'t come up with a new story, so they did a filler episode. Sometimes this was a flashback episode, sometimes it was a musical, sometimes it just had the characters running around in circles. \"Folie à Deux\" is the latter. The movie is almost 140 minutes long but there\\'s basically no progress to the overall \"Joker\" story. Don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s not boring (for me at least, others who expect a \"true\" sequel might feel a different way) but, apart from introducing Harleen and Harvey Dent, and a tiny origin story, there\\'s no point to it. It\\'s a movie that feels as if it wants to set up another sequel but it barely even does that.The ending of \"Joker\" felt satisfying, the ending of \"Folie à Deux\" just left me asking: \"What now? This can\\'t be it, right? Where\\'s the rest?\"',\n",

       "    'Review': 'I wish I could erase this movie from my brain so that I can enjoy the first movie without knowing the disappointing way the story concludes.The first joker film showed us Arthur\\'s journey from a victim of society, downtrodden and unloved, to his own hero who finally passes his breaking point and learns to stand up for his own beliefs. He finally has confidence, love and self respect and all of his restraints have snapped.Folie a Deux seems to undo all of that character development and turns him back into victim who will never be able to break free. A theme of the movie is whether the Joker is real or whether he is just a fantasy or figment and the moral of the story appears to be that Arthur will always be just Arthur and nothing more.The songs add very little to the plot and some seem misplaced as if they\\'ve been forced in to the story despite holding almost no relevance.The plot is incredibly basic and moves nothing forward. Arthur attends court hearings while dating Lee. It seems as though it purposefully makes no sense like it\\'s a nod to Arthur\\'s joke \"I hope my death makes more cents that my life.\" At one point Gaga\\'s character, Lee, tells Arthur to stop taking his meds as though there is something planned for him or his rescue but it\\'s never mentioned again and is only relevant to show that Lee only really loves him when he\\'s the Joker rather than himself.They add strange social commentaries for example Gary from his work in the first movie testifying that Arthur has caused him the same fear that Arthur once felt, as if trying to blatantly point out that evil begets evil, but it just comes across as a bit bizarre and irrelevant.They also add more information about his mother mocking him to others which seems out of character for how his mother was played in the first movie as though they only added it to make something, anything, happen within the plot.Phoenix and Gaga do a fabulous job and are the high point of the movie but they\\'re really not given much of a script to work with. The relationship between the characters isn\\'t really explored and there is no Folie a Deux present. Gaga\\'s character fangirls over Joker and they begin a romance. The relationship doesn\\'t go any further, they don\\'t become any kind of chaos causing team-up, they just date a bit while Arthur attends court like she\\'s a groupie which is a disappointment. The relationship between them could have been fascinating if the appropriate time had been spent on it rather than their main on screen time together being during dance sequences.All in all the movie falls flat. Worth a watch once but once is enough.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Saw Joker 2 today.Someone behind me as I was leaving the cinema summed it perfectly - 'It's not as impactful as the first.'The first Joker was a gritty, uncompromising, nasty, tension filled and utterly unique look at a man's mental illness. Joker 2 undoubtedly shares those same qualities but to a far lesser degree, failing to reach the lofty heights of it's predecessor.Joker 2 though isn't bad - it just feels as if it's lost it's way. I totally clicked with the intentions, themes and messages of the first movie whereas in Joker 2 I can't honestly say I felt the same way. I was left confused by what the film was trying to say to me.What Joker 2 does do is greatly expand on the character of Arthur Fleck, yet strangely not in a way that felt satisfying. I kept wanting to know more or connect emotionally but the reality is I couldn't. I understood but I just didn't care. Joker built the character of Arthur Fleck up whilst Folie A Deux knocks the character right back down.The stand out of Joker 2 are the performances. Phoenix is pitch perfect again as Fleck (if sightly less menacing) whist Gaga is not a bad choice as Harley but here is where one of my biggest points against the film stands - I didn't like their relationship. I felt it didn't really build or develop as naturally as it should and it definitely didn't go the way I expected it to. Although it's clearly not a film set in the typical Batman world, Folie A Deux felt like an outright betrayal of the lore of the world.Maybe I went into Joker: Folie A Deux with too many expectations. But a film can disappoint your expectations and still be an excellent film - but Joker: Folie A Deux isn't an excellent film. IGo in expecting something unlike anything you've ever seen before and you may be pleased. Go on expecting a decent sequel to Joker and you'll be disappointed. I unfortunately have to not recommend it.\",\n",

But I could understand why people enjoyed it (not counting all the incels who base their entire personality on the movie).But this movie..it's hard to like. Even with Lady Gaga putting in a pretty admirable performance. Joker goes from a character who is down on his luck and society has painted him in the corner, to just completely unredeemable in every way. Worst of all, the movie is boring. You take a character like Joker and you put him one of the most boring settings, a courtroom, and that's where most of the major scenes take place! Where's the unpredictability? Where is Fleck interacting with the world that he created? Sowing the seeds of chaos that he planted in the first movie? DC continues to prove that they have no clue what to do with this character. And it's disappointing to say the least. You're better off watching Batman the Animated Series reruns and the Dark Knight at least that Joker is menacing and a credible threat. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'I will try to write objectively. Going to see this film, I wanted to see the development of the Joker\\'s story and, of course, Harley Quinn (especially judging by the trailers, the film\\'s title, etc.). What do we actually see? Harley has essentially no role in this film.I liked the fact that the film is depicted as a \"parallel universe\" where it is no longer the Joker who dumps Harley, but vice versa, but the charm of the characters is completely lost. Harley just looks like some kind of \"bad girl\" who dump a man at every turn and uses him. But just to do what? This storyline was completely incomprehensible to me.I also didn\\'t like the ending at all. Death? Seriously? You could have removed 50 per cent of the songs from the film and come up with a cool, good story, it would have been even more epic if Harley had killed him.This is a bit of a my professional thing to say as lawyer, but I want to complain about the trial. Arthur\\'s condition shows that he is mentally ill, but the court insists that he is not. What kind of nonsense is this? The only adequate character in this regard is the Arthur\\'s lawyer.Finally, I would like to add a word about the songs. They are good, based on old classics, but my God, there are so many of them! I was sitting in the cinema with my friends and doing facepalms when a new song started playing. In my opinion, 60% of the songs were just out of place. Yes, this film was billed as a musical, but this genre doesn\\'t fit here at all. This is not Disney and I had a completely different idea of this film.5/10 for the cool vibe (between songs), the acting and the interesting plot (only during the court hearings, which kept me in suspense).',\n",

And I really don't know what to say. I am flabbergasted about how bad this movie is, I actually feel bad for the entire cast & crew who obviously did their utter best to deliver.It's an incoherent sequence of clips, alternating between the real world and the fantasy world of Arthur Fleck. Not only that, it's also a musical, kind of. Of course I heard the rumors, but I didn't take it that seriously. I have to say, it's a bold and unique move, but it just doesn't work at all.When there finally would be a scene of tension - accompanied by the brooding music we all know from part 1 - I lit up, but it would be completely destroyed by either Arthur, Joker or Harley Quinzel who would start to sing a (silly) song. With 'silly', I mean silly in the context of this movie, and my expectations, and through the lens of Joker 1, which was a really dark, depressing movie.Now that I'm writing this, I again realize why Joker 1 was so friggin good: It really made me FEEL something. Something deep and profound. Empathy for Arthur Fleck, whose history made him who he is. But also empathy for all the lonely (young) men around the world who share Arthur's story.Even as a standalone movie I think it's bad. No tension at all. On top of that - SPOILER ALERT - at the end of the movie it is implied the real JOKER appears. WTF!?!Again, even though I said quite a lot above, I am lost for words...\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker (2019) was a really pretty darn good. I love the idea of taking the batman universe and telling a story about one of its villains from his perspective, giving the audience a new perspective on villains in general. Heath Ledger's Joker can't be competed with, so I'm glad they went in a completely different direction. I loved the ending of the first film, and was really looking forward to seeing this one.Joker: Folie a Deux starts off decent enough, but quickly putters out as the film drags and drags. The musical numbers are fine at first, but quickly wear out their welcome. This entire movie is centered around the trial for the atrocities that Joker committed in the first film.Arthur Fleck's character seems to have devolved from the last movie. He barely even laughs anymore, despite the fact that this is supposed to be a condition that he can't control. There are several plot points that leave you confused. One of which being when Harley Quinn burns down the Arkham prison and then just decides to check herself out after. Nobody sees her start the fire and nobody suspects her, despite the fact that she has a history of arson? Huh?The ending is what upsets me the most. It's borderline nonsensical and almost seems like they just needed a way to kill off this character. Maybe Joaquin Pheonix is pulling a Harrison Ford here, and demanded that they end this so he doesn't have to starve himself anymore. I honestly wouldn't blame him.This movie could have easily not been made at all, and I feel like its existence only hurts what would otherwise be a cult classic as just a standalone Joker (2019). A highly anticipated film that is now a highly disappointing one.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"After the intense psychological exploration in the first part of Joker, this sequel falls short in many ways. While the original film provided a deep and unsettling look into the psyche of Arthur Fleck and his transformation into the iconic villain, this installment seems to lack that same focus. Instead of building on the character's mental unraveling, the movie distracts itself\\nwith songs that don't seem to fit the narrative or enhance the story in any meaningful way. The plot feels disjointed and fails to capture the raw emotion and tension that made the first Joker film so compelling.The majority of the scenes come across as incoherent, lacking a clear direction or purpose. For much of the runtime, it's difficult to understand what the movie is trying to achieve, and the pacing feels uneven. The only moment that truly stands out is the final second of the film, which delivers a payoff that might resonate with hardcore fans of the DC Universe. However, for those who are not well-versed in the intricacies of the DC lore, even this moment may leave viewers feeling confused or unsatisfied.In summary, Joker 2024 doesn't capture the same depth or tension as its predecessor. Its reliance on unrelated musical choices and a plot that only makes sense to those deeply familiar with DC's background diminishes what could have been a powerful continuation of the Joker's story.\",\n",

But this feels more like a film-student \"homage\" that should have been released as a special feature disc packaged along with the first movie and the true sequel we will now never get.Never mind there being no action, there was essentially no PLOT until the last 20 minutes or so of its overstuffed run time. Instead we were \"treated\" to endless musical fantasies playng out in Arthur\\'s head, expressions of his own twisted Joker persona. Or maybe it was Gaga\\'s / Harley\\'s? Who knows? Who cares?That\\'s not to say they weren\\'t well done. The song selection was very good, and although Phoenix can\\'t sing to save his life, they did play well into the established Joker character, much like his exuberant dancing on the talk-show stage before he kills Murray in the first film.But there must have been TWENTY of these musical interludes (I didn\\'t count, and am sure not going to watch it again just to find out.) But I can say that after an hour and a half of these, when the music started to rise for yet another Lady Gaga ego-trip, the audience in my theater literally GROANED (is that the reaction you were going for, sweetie?) And when the credits began to roll, I heard a lot of comments along the lines of \"I waited years / I spent money for THAT?\"Although it feels like a cheat, I could have maybe forgiven this money-grab if it had left room for a proper sequel later on. Unfortunately, this will be the last we\\'ll see of this particular Joker, since (in one of the ONLY surprises of the movie) he was stabbed to death at the end, having NEVER had the encounter with Batman we all were hoping to see someday.This was little more than a sop to the overestimated talents of \"Lady Gaga.\" What a waste of money, time, and audience interest.

       "    'Review': \"Since its announcement, *Joker: Folie à Deux* has generated high expectations, but the final result seems to distort the essence of the character that captivated audiences in the first installment. Despite anticipating a deep exploration of Arthur Fleck's psyche, the film devolves into a prolonged and repetitive monologue that ultimately becomes tiresome.Throughout its two and a half hours, the narrative focuses almost exclusively on Fleck's lamentations, neglecting the complexities that made the first film resonate. The psychological depth that characterized the original character has been sacrificed, leaving behind a reiteration of the same themes without a meaningful exploration of their social and cultural impact on Gotham.The inclusion of Lady Gaga is another aspect that could have been leveraged, yet her character remains underdeveloped. Instead of contributing to the narrative, her presence feels superficial, diminishing the expected relevance of her participation. The climactic sequence, which could have served as an emotional peak, appears more as a narrative device than as an organic development of the story. The lack of coherence in the characters' motivations becomes evident when the explosion presented does not seem to significantly affect Joker, despite the gravity of the situation.Furthermore, the focus on the judicial system is disappointing. The portrayal of lawyers is caricatured and fails to capture the complexity of a legal process that could have added an intriguing dimension to the plot. Despite the popular fervor surrounding Joker, the character walks the streets as if he were a stranger in his own city, contradicting the attention he had previously received.In conclusion, *Joker: Folie à Deux* fails to achieve the depth or the social and cultural relevance of its predecessor. The film becomes an empty exercise that does not invite reflection, offering an experience that feels more like mere spectacle than an analysis of character and its implications in society. The story lacks the emotional and psychological richness that was anticipated, resulting in a work that, regrettably, feels dispensable.\",\n",

Philips takes a big swing to make this a musical in the vein of Moulin Rouge. Most of that works fine although a bit conservative in the song choices. The problem I had with the film is that its lacking three crucial story elements. First and foremost is tension. Arthur Fleck is so neutered in this sequel that he no longer feels like a ticking time bomb ready to explode. You don\\'t fear him, he\\'s not scary and he no longer feels unpredictable. The second is you gotta have an antagonist, there isn\\'t one. If I had to guess I assume it\\'s supposed to be the \\'system\\' but we don\\'t really know anything about the underhanded motivations of the attorney\\'s or the judge to subvert the audience to root for Joker to get some form of revenge against them like he did against Murray Franklin. Third, there\\'s no follow up to the \"Is Thomas Wayne Arthur\\'s father and is Bruce who will become Batman his brother?\" The first film did a great job of establishing Arthur as an unreliable narrator leaving the audience to wonder what\\'s real and what\\'s fantasy. There\\'s none of that in the sequel. But perhaps the worst sin of the film is you just don\\'t care about what happens to Fleck\\'s character, largely because he doesn\\'t seem to care. What is Arthur Fleck trying to accomplish in his journey? What does he want? I have no idea. The whole film builds toward a very anti-climactic conclusion that makes it hard to understand what the point of the whole movie was outside of a cash grab. It\\'s not awful, it\\'s not great, it just has no reason to exist.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker 2 was not at all what I expected, and honestly, it had absolutely no reason to exist. The idea of Joker as a character has so much potential, and I was exited for all the interesting ways in which the story could have gone, but this simply didn\\'t. Yes, it\\'s musical, and while the musical numbers added little to nothing, yet I had absolutely no problem with them. The acting? Impeccable by Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga-no complaints on that level. However, the story itself? What a disappointment.As you watch, you get this feeling that nothing\\'s really happening. That realization burrows in slow, and by the end, you\\'re just sitting there thinking, \"That\\'s it? Really?\" It just seemed to go nowhere, especially where the character of Arthur/Joker was concerned. It is gorgeously shot and looks amazing; the movie, from a cinematic point of view, is stunning. The ambiance and atmosphere hit all the right notes. But with all that said and done, it doesn\\'t do anything.You just keep waiting for the story to take flight or do something major, and instead, it introduces Harley Quinn then. Nothing. It really feels like it\\'s digging itself into a hole instead of going anywhere meaningful. I think they should have taken the story in a whole other direction or did more with it.So for now, this feels like the end of this Elseworlds story, and truthfully, that is probably for the best.',\n",

It\\'s such a strange medium for this kind of story. Some of the musical numbers work, but many feel misplaced or unnecessary, detracting from the tension and grit that defined the original. The music itself is well-executed, but the film doesn\\'t fully commit to being a musical or a psychological thriller, and that left me feeling like it was trying to do too much without fully succeeding in either.Ultimately, it was a strange mix of genres that left me feeling confused and underwhelmed, which is disappointing given how much I liked the original film.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Some viewers were upset that Joker (2019) borrowed too heavily from Taxi Driver (1976). This was very similar to fan complaints of Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) being too much like Star Wars: A New Hope (1977). So, for the second installment in that series, Rian Johnson made some bold and divisive choices. The difference between the choices made by Johnson then, and Todd Phillips now, is that the choices Johnson made had legs. Whether you liked The Last Jedi (2017) or not you can admit that the movie had bold ideas, but these ideas were also interesting. The same can not be said for Joker Folie a Deux.Making a super villain movie a musical is indeed a bold move, however, nothing was done to make it an interesting move/movie. For it to be a strong idea, the musical elements of the film have to land or at least be memorable. Cycling through the Best of the 50s and 60s isn't a bold musical choice. If you're going to go full musical, which this is, put some time into making original songs.Remove all the music from Folie a Deux and what do you have? A two hour slog split between Arkham Asylum and the courtoom. The few moments where Joaquin Phoenix is allowed to cook (doing a Foghorn Leghorn voice in court) are some of the few bright spots in the film. Otherwise, this was an ambitious undertaking that isn't even interesting enough to be polarizing.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Spoiler Alert!Sadly, Todd Phillip's totally missed the mark on this one. He has shown the ability to direct heavier material (A Star is Born) after making his name with comedic buddy movies. This long anticipated sequel reunites Phillips with both Phoenix and Gaga from previous films and had potential written all over it. Instead, much of the storyline drags along and fails to get to what everyone was hoping for, the origins of The Joker and Harley Quinn and how they rise to criminal fame in Gotham!The entire movie is filmed within the confines of Arkham Prison and the courtroom which leads to long, monotonous scenes that never get to any real resolution. There is the initial chemistry between Joaquin and Lady G which lets us think something wicked and chaotic is brewing. Instead we get bombarded with way too many Broadway show tunes sung by both. 2-4 would have sufficed. Not the 10 or so we had to sit through. We get it Todd! Lady Gaga is a talented actress and singer but this isn't the sequel to A Star is Born but the sequel to Joker! Do we have to wait another 2 years to see if they miraculously reunite and create bedlam on Gotham?! Movie felt longer than reality due to the slow pace and endless singing. Highly disappointing. It will undoubtedly recoup its 200 million budget but DC coulda have hit some major box office if only they would have given the audience what they wanted.\",\n",

       "    'Review': '5.3/10 (Don\\'t Recommend)Oftentimes when I see a review, or reviews, of movies before I go see them and they\\'re on the negative side. I try and push them aside. I hope I\\'ll see something the reviewer didn\\'t see and have a better outcome. Unfortunately, that is not the case for \"Folie á Deux\".My concluding thoughts on the film were, \"man what a waste.\" The first \"Joker\" film is amazing. It\\'s fun, exciting, and you have someone to root for. This movie is utterly boring and useless. It\\'s not funny. It\\'s depressing and not memorable. It lacks actual character, and I feel like it gives me no one to root for.While some could argue that the soundtrack is good, I personally think it\\'s a distraction. Every time a musical number comes up, just as I was beginning to enjoy a sequence, I felt like the winds in the sail were blown out because it takes away from the pacing of the film. I personally think the musical numbers should\\'ve been worked in with something happening on screen pertinent to the movie.I\\'m indifferent to Joaquin Phoenix in this one. He definitely sold the depressing aspect of the film, but scenes where there should\\'ve been energy, he definitely lacked. Lady Gaga feels like she\\'s just trying to salvage her career. I don\\'t know if she\\'s still producing music, but there was a lacklustre performance from her. She\\'s also the only reason I believe this film was a musical. If she\\'s not in it then I think it would\\'ve been a normal film.Overall, it\\'s a long two hours of nothingness. The ending is atrocious and the beginning is forgettable. The middle is dredged by an ebb and flow of enjoyable film interspersed with terribly paced musicals. Also, it was difficult to understand the spoken word at times in general. Mix that with a musical and sometimes I was hoping I didn\\'t miss anything important. If I knew then what I now, I would\\'ve definitely waited for the film to hit a digital stream. For me it\\'s not even worth going on a cheap night, nor if someone was willing to pay for my ticket to go just to keep them company. But I can\\'t keep you from going so the choice is always yours....That\\'s it for now. Thanks for taking time to read my review. Happy watching and enjoy the show!',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker: Folie à Deux attempts to blend musical elements with psychological drama, but the execution often cuts the pacing. The musical numbers occasionally work, but more often than not, they disrupt the flow, leaving the audience in my theater dreading each one as they appeared. It\\'s a puzzling choice, especially since it felt like the film\\'s target audience wasn\\'t suited for this musical direction.Arthur\\'s relationship with Harley feels underdeveloped, and the progression was predictable, offering little emotional impact. Each scene between them felt like it was building toward something deeper, but ultimately, it just led to \"one more song.\" The chemistry between them, while not terrible, lacked the complexity and tension that could have driven their dynamic further.The tone stayed consistent with the first film heavy-handed and occasionally oppressive. There was less of the classic violence often associated with Joker, which I didn\\'t particularly mind, but the film\\'s messaging still felt forceful and lacked nuance.The third act is where the film finally comes alive, albeit briefly. Here, we start to see some character progression, particularly in how the two worlds have always coexisted. There\\'s a shift that hints at a deeper message about society\\'s celebration of grifting and deception, though it\\'s not fully explored. The fading paint on Arthur\\'s face, symbolizing the gradual dissolution of his facade, was a nice touch one of the few visual details that added depth to the story.In the end, much like the first Joker, Folie à Deux falls short. The musical aspect, while occasionally helpful, mostly gets in the way of the already thin story. Despite some good performances, particularly in the songs, and a stronger third act, the film doesn\\'t offer the depth or complexity needed to truly resonate.',\n",

At times it looked like the story could go in the direction of exploring Joker/Arthurs psyche, to then suddenly turn the focus onto Gaga's character or another unfitting song. Other times the story would look like it was going towards Joker and Harley having the comic book relationship many would've liked to see (done better than suicide squad) on the big screen, to again ripping it out from under the audience. From the outside it seemed like the writers just wanted to write a surreal, whimsical musical, and forgot to have an actual fulfilling story.All in all, the movie had loads of beautiful cinematogrophy done by Lawrence Sher, the usual impressive acting by phoenix, and a surprisingly good performance by Lady Gaga. But the story lacked a direction and a theme. Overall disappointing movie after how good the first one was.\",\n",

Joker is a passive character and we learn nothing new about him, the development he has is that he realizes he doesn't want to be the Joker anymore, which does not a single bit represent the character we've seen in the last film. It rather represents a commentary about the critics and audiences that looked at Joker from a morally questionable standpoint. And of course, Joker can't do what Joker does anymore because that would hurt the Image of the Filmmaker. Or should I say the Studio?The point is that this film plays it safe. Joker doesn't blow up things, he doesn't play games, he isn't on the verge of becoming Gothams biggest threat, he isn't the Joker. He's just Arthur. And I am watching this film to experience the embracement of The Joker that Arthur develops throughout the story, which unfortunately doesn't happen...Joaquin Phoenix does his best but it isn't enough to make this Character fully fleshed out. Even Lady Gaga, which has no depth to her character, doesn't serve the story a single bit. There is nothing they discover about each other, there is no room for development in these two. They have no chemistry together because Harley being in Arthur's Life doesn't change anything about his character. The same goes for her.The courtroom scenes have their moments, but all these moments do is referencing the first movie.I can understand that these musical scenes should give us a glimpse of Joker's mind, but there is nothing f-d up about these sequences beside a few things. The mind of the Joker is way more disturbing than dancing and singing happily.And yes, The Filmmaking and the score is great in every single scene, but it does not help when the picture releases no emotions inside of you.Yes, it is logical for Arthur to defend himself in court. Yes it's a more realistic take on the relationship of Harley and Joker. But depth is not existing. Realism without Depth and meaning means nothing.That said, I would rather have an illogical story that is thematically strong, than an story that makes sense but is thematically shallow.\",\n",

As a musical, it falls really flat, and there's only so much heavy lifting Lady Gaga's voice can do. It made me wish I was rewatching Chicago instead, and Dancer in the Dark is a better crime/courtroom musical too.Joker: Folie a Deux feels provocative in an empty way, whereas the divisive original movie felt like it had a bit more to say and said it in a way that was often clear and engaging. This sequel is all over the shop, but not in a fun or varied way.The pacing is quite shoddy, and the interestingly grungy world of the first movie doesn't get explored much here, owing to so much of the film being set in a maximum security psychiatric facility or a courtroom. The fantasy sequences wear out their welcome after a very short while. There's little rhyme or reason as to when they appear and why.Joaquin Phoenix is good, but the performance feels lacking compared to the first seeing as the material lets him down. Lady Gaga does her best, but she's given far less to work with here than expected. No one gives an abysmal performance by any means, but no one has what they need to excel. The writing here feels lazy, and it hurts the actors.I'm a little more positive on how it looks. Some of this visually gives the film a pulse here and there. And though the songs aren't implemented well, the score here is excellent, courtesy of Hildur Guðnadóttir once again.I wanted to come away admiring the film going for broke and indulging in a genre lots of people seem to resist or outright reject. I feel that's what most people are going to latch onto and dislike by default with this film. I like musicals, though. I just don't really like this musical.

       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is the sequel to the 2019 superhero/supervillain film \"Joker\". Once again directed and co-written by Todd Phillips (\"Road Trip\", \"Old School\", the \"Hangover\" trilogy) and starring Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, it is an underwhelming continuation of the brilliant original that doesn\\'t end up delivering what it promises.Sometime after the events of the first film, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is incarcerated at Arkham State Hospital awaiting trial for the murders and misdemeanors he caused years earlier. During his stay, Arthur struggles to deal with his duel identity as \"Joker\", unable to distinguish between his own actions and those of the destructive persona he created. As the media prepares to extensively cover the upcoming legal proceedings, Arthur meets Harleen \"Lee\" Quinzel (Lady Gaga), a new patient at the Hospital who admires him as the Joker and as his own damaged self. Amidst the ensuing chaos of media scrutiny and public outcry, Arthur and Lee\\'s infatuation with each other begins to grow, culminating in their mutual appreciation for the music inside of them.I am always hesitant to refer to a movie as a \"modern masterpiece\", however, I firmly believe that 2019\\'s \"Joker\" is well worthy of such an honour. This movie works not only as a fantastic contemporary origin story of one of the most famous comic book villains of all time but also as a social commentary on the human condition and the stigma of mental illnesses. As a result, the film managed to transcend the boundaries of your typical \"superhero\" movie, allowing audiences from all walks of life to take note of everything important it was trying to say. Although the film was clearly intended as a standalone feature, Warner Bros. Later decided to continue the story in the sequel \"Joker: Folie à Deux\", a decision that does not work in their favour as it fails to recapture nearly everything that made its excellent predecessor so impactful.In the years since his arrest, we see that Arthur Fleck has now built up quite a notorious reputation throughout his new home at Arkham Asylum. His fellow inmates fear and respect him for the anarchy he was responsible for years ago, and the guards frequently taunt him into telling them a \"funny joke\" to cause his Joker personality to emerge. Yet in spite of all this acknowledgement he once deeply craved, Arthur remains relatively quiet and mostly keeps to himself. Occasionally, Arthur\\'s signature pained laughing outbursts stemming from his condition may occur from time to time, but he does nothing about it until it eventually subsides. Later, we learn that Arthur is set to stand trial for his crimes, to which his law team try to argue that his actions were actually caused by his Joker persona, meaning he can enter an insanity plea and escape the death penalty. Though all of this seems like a solid way to begin a sequel to the original, what follows is where the film starts to fall apart from the seams.During a therapy session, Arthur comes into contact with Lee, a seemingly troubled woman who claims to have burned down her parents\\' apartment building. The two form a connection with one another and come up with a plan to \"ditch this joint\" and go on the run. The way the film chooses to present this to us is through song, with the pair of them singing and dancing to pre-existing music. Normally, I wouldn\\'t have minded this unorthodox addition to the film if it were handled properly, which unfortunately it isn\\'t. The problem here is that none of the songs are all that memorable and don\\'t really leave a lasting impression, and for a film that sets itself up as a musical, that is a major issue. Because of that, I never really felt as though these two were kindred spirits proclaiming their love for one another as much as a pair of weirdos singing along to music that only they can hear.Another issue is that the film\\'s screenplay lacks proper cohesion. In the original movie, every pivotal event that took place always flowed flawlessly from one scene to the next, with each character-focused moment communicating all of the necessary information back to the audience. Here, on the other hand, the plot feels so fragmented and inconsistent that it\\'s difficult to fixate your attention on a particular scene without concern as to whether it will matter later on. For instance, in this one scene involving Arthur professing his love for Lee, he is shown doing so during a televised interview, which you\\'d assume would lead to something important immediately after. However, this is not the case, as it quickly ends and its relevance to the plot is never brought up again. There are several other moments like this which constantly tease the audience that something huge about to happen, only for it to disappear into thin air a short time later. After a while, this makes the film incredibly frustrating to watch.To give credit where it is due, I really appreciate that the film was able to recreate the original\\'s superb cinematography and visual style. I absolutely loved the dreary, gritty imagery that director Todd Phillips used in the first film, which gave it a very distinct look to help this 1980s version of Gotham City stand out from all of the others. Thankfully, this sequel follows suit in that regard, as there were moments that I thought were visually stunning. Without giving away spoilers, there was this one part that involved Arthur and Lee looking into each other\\'s eyes with fire burning in the background. The blocking of this scene illuminates Arthur while Lee is mostly shown in the dark, symbolising the bright but destructive way she lights up his life. This proves that there was at least some creative thought put into this film from a visual standpoint, so it surprises me that virtually everything else falls flat in comparison.Reprising one of the greatest roles of his career, Joaquin Phoenix does everything he can to remind us of why his performance in the original film is now ranked alongside Heath Ledger as among the best live action depictions of the Joker. However, in the grand scheme of things, it just simply isn\\'t enough to save this film from the rest of its problems. Because of all the glaring faults in the film\\'s screenplay, direction, and plot inconsistencies, it\\'s near impossible to feel much empathy for Arthur this time around. His character does not do much aside from repeatedly yearn for Lee through song or make weak excuses for his criminal behaviour in the previous film. I missed all that anticipation and unpredictability of what Arthur would do next, as this was one of the key things that made him so interesting last time. Sadly, I never once felt any of that from this movie.Perhaps the biggest disappointment, for me at least, was the utilisation of Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn (a.k.a. Lee). In the lead up to the film\\'s release, I was actually looking forward to seeing how Gaga would portray the Joker\\'s female sidekick/love interest, as I thought she was a great choice to play this emotionally damaged character. Unfortunately, there\\'s hardly anything memorable worth mentioning about her involvement in the story other than her thinking what Arthur did in the first movie was \"bold\" and \"brave\". This could have been the perfect time to provide a commentary on toxic relationships and why many imprisoned murderers have loyal female fans, but the film squanders all these moments away at every given opportunity. What we get instead is a rather two-dimensional story of a mentally ill man and a mentally ill woman who have no other reason to want to be together other than that they are both unstable people. To add insult to injury, Lee is hardly even in the film enough to leave a lasting impression, and considering she\\'s supposed to be one of the main characters, this seems like a very bizarre creative decision.For a follow-up to one of the greatest films of the 2010s, the only thing that \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" has done is prove that just because you can make a sequel, doesn\\'t always mean that you should. After five years, I can still remember picking my jaw up from the floor in amazement after watching the first film, whereas with this one I was struggling to recall anything in great detail without the need to look it up online. Nobody is going to be playfully reenacting dance numbers from this movie and nobody is going to be quoting from it anytime soon like they did with its predecessor. In my humble opinion, Warner Bros. Should have left the original as a standalone film, as I think everything concluded perfectly then and there. It makes me think that this unnecessary sequel may just be one big joke at our expense. If it is, then I don\\'t get it.I rate it 5/10.',\n",

       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is a film that finds itself in the middle and balances between being good or bad, in other words it is \"decent\" or \"so-so\". By adding the musical genre, the script is strange to the concept presented in the first film, and does not have that avant-garde element that director Todd Phillips hoped to capture. The script touches on interesting elements about a social idol, who creates a cult and who, by presenting himself as he really is, divides opinions among his fans, apart from this, the script fails to go further. The cinematography is good being the strong point of the film. The musical numbers manage to be of mixed quality, there are good ones and bad ones. The production level is high, making it the most notable positive point of this sequel. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance declines compared to the first film and Lady Gaga achieves a good role that loses intensity in the plot. Todd Phillips\\' work as director is very average on this occasion. \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is a film with ups and downs that works in some scenes.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"The original film Joker showed a character progression of Arthur Fleck to the Joker. This film showed the progression of Arthur Fleck to Arthur Fleck. That in itself is problematic for a sequel. To build on this, the first movie was a thriller, this movie is a court drama musical. Joaquin Phoenix is an amazing actor, Lady Gaga is not. Lady Gaga is an amazing singer, and she barely showed it off for a musical. Nothing about this movie makes any sense. At best it's a good comedy, at worst it made me tired. It's not awful, it's just not for fans of the first movie. It's for people that like Lady Gaga, and for people that like musicals. I saw the first movie 4 times in the theatres, I'll only watch this one once.I think that Joker was a brilliantly realistic take on mental illness. It gave a voice to people struggling, and gave people insight into what creates a killer. It was a complex narrative on classicism and the struggles of modernity in a capitalistic society. This movie lacks depth comparatively, and it feels as if it was deliberately used to poke fun at Arthur Fleck and then kill him off. I had sympathy for him in the first movie, you feel bad for him, you're rooting for him even at his worse, and when he kills Murray, in the words of Quentin, the director made you want that to happen. Why does he kiss a guy in this movie? Why did the director feel the need to add Harley Quinn and make her a normal person? Why after so much character development did he go back to being a loser? The fans wanted a spectacle, to see what he would do after his final transformation, and nothing happened.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"After the masterpiece that the first Joker film was, I waited for the sequel to be even more amazing-especially with the intriguing subtitle, Folie à Deux, hinting at a deep dive into the shared madness between two characters. Unfortunately, what I got instead was a film that left me feeling profoundly underwhelmed.Yes, the acting is undeniably strong. Joaquin Phoenix continues to deliver his methodical, unsettling portrayal of Arthur Fleck, and Lady Gaga shows real potential as Harley Quinn. Both actors gave it their all, but the material they were working with left much to be desired. The script gave them little room to explore the complexity of their characters. In contrast to the first Joker-a dark psychological thriller that masterfully peeled back the layers of Fleck's mind-the sequel felt hollow, relying more on style than substance.The decision to make Joker: Folie à Deux a musical was certainly not the best choice. In theory, I can understand wanting to inject something new into the sequel to avoid being a carbon copy of the original, but the genre shift felt really out of place considering how Joker was lauded for its haunting, psychological approach to topics like mental illness and societal breakdown.Lady Gaga, was clearly cast to showcase her acting chops, not just her vocal skills. So why lean so heavily into the singing? It felt as though the filmmakers were more interested in creating an extravagant showcase for her musical abilities than allowing her to fully inhabit the darker, twisted persona of Harley Quinn. Her acting moments showed promise, but the movie never gave her the space to explore her character in a way that felt authentic or emotionally resonant.In the end, Joker: Folie à Deux feels like a missed opportunity. It lacks the raw, nerve-wracking intensity of its predecessor and tries to compensate with flashy musical numbers and surreal set-pieces. But beneath that glittery surface, there's not much to hold on to. The psychological depth that made the original Joker such a profound and unsettling experience is largely absent here, replaced by spectacle.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'When you decide to make a sequel to what is arguably the best \"become villain\" film ever made, you\\'re probably very confident in what you\\'re doing. How confident Todd Phillips and the team were-I\\'ll try to break down in my fresh pre-premiere impressions with a bit more analysis. When the film was first announced as a musical, it instantly received a lot of backlash. You might have already noticed the hate has grown even more after the pre-release screenings. While some think it\\'s because of the musical aspect, I wouldn\\'t fully agree. My friend Tarik, who joined me in the packed IMAX theater, did protest by wincing at the start of each singing scene.The musical here operates largely on an abstract level, and as such, it\\'s visually very pleasing and aurally effective in the context of Joker and Harley\\'s \"madness for two.\" However, since most of the musical segments don\\'t really affect the plot, they feel unnecessary. The few songs integrated into the real-time narrative didn\\'t convince me of their purpose, leaving the overall musical component as passable but far from what a good film in that genre should be.Before diving into the plot elements without spoiling anything, I must address the film\\'s title, which is there purely as \"bait\" to get you into the theater and spend money on the film. \"Folie à Deux\" refers only to the abstract part of the film, so if you were expecting wild and murderous adventures of Harley and Joker, forget about it. As the trailers suggested, the plot takes place in a prison, two years after the chaotic events in Gotham when we watched Arthur Fleck\\'s transformation into Joker. Now, Joker is facing trial for what he\\'s done, making the majority of the film a courtroom drama. But we\\'ve all seen good courtroom dramas, and \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" functions quite well in that regard. The drama is tense, filled with great dialogue and, I must say, humor. The film carries a wonderfully subtle humor-at least that\\'s how I interpreted many scenes, though I can\\'t say for certain whether that was the director\\'s intent.Like the first part, this film boasts visually stunning shots, phenomenal acting from Joaquin Phoenix, decent performance from Lady Gaga, and top-tier set design. Harley Quinn, portrayed well by Gaga, has little impact on the plot, which didn\\'t sit well with me. On the other hand, Joker\\'s psychological development is notable, something I found impressive at first, but it eventually ruined the film for me. Despite its flaws, this was a good movie right up until the end. However, in the final third, the writers take a narrative turn that reduces Joker to just another average socially distorted character, rather than the symbol of nihilism, madness, and chaos that he has always been. This is a shallow, misguided, and, to use a colloquial term, idiotic choice by the writers, further exacerbated by the film\\'s conclusion. It\\'s unlikely to sit well with even the most hardcore fans, and I really wanted to like this film.In conclusion, \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" is not only an inconsistent sequel but also a completely thoughtless approach to the core idea this story should represent, leaving a bitter taste for all fans.',\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': 'Style Over Substance in a Disjointed Sequel',\n",
       "    'Review': 'Joker: Folie à Deux, directed by Todd Phillips, is a sequel to the critically acclaimed Joker (2019) starring Joaquin Phoenix, but it falls short of the raw intensity and thought-provoking nature of its predecessor. The film was intended to explore the concept of folie à deux-a psychological condition where two individuals share the same delusional belief. However, despite its title, the movie fails to fully engage with this complex psychological theme, leaving the audience with more questions than answers and a sense of missed opportunity.A Misunderstanding of Folie à Deux\\nIn its essence, folie à deux refers to the transmission of delusions from one person to another, often resulting in a shared psychosis. The film hints at this dynamic, particularly in the relationship between Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) and Harley Quinn (Lady Gaga), but it never delves deeply enough into the psychological implications of their shared madness. Harley\\'s transformation into the devoted companion of the Joker, often portrayed in comics and films as a descent into madness alongside Arthur, feels incomplete in this movie.Instead of focusing on how Arthur\\'s twisted worldview infects Harley\\'s psyche, the film opts for multiple musical numbers that distract from the core narrative. These singalongs, while visually interesting, don\\'t add the emotional or psychological depth needed to explore the idea of shared madness. Rather than enhancing the story, these sequences feel like unnecessary distractions, prolonging the runtime and diluting the intensity that made the first Joker film so compelling. In fact, without these musical interludes, the film could have been much tighter, and perhaps, more focused.The Courtroom Focus and Missed Potential\\nA significant portion of Joker: Folie à Deux is spent preparing for courtroom scenes that are meant to build tension around Arthur\\'s fate. Unfortunately, these scenes fall flat, lacking the impact they should have had. The legal drama, which could have provided a powerful setting to explore Joker\\'s manipulation and the spread of his delusions, becomes a drawn-out and somewhat tedious process.Arthur\\'s trial is supposed to be a climax, a moment where the consequences of his influence on society become apparent, but the execution feels underwhelming. The court scenes miss the chance to create a meaningful confrontation or delve into Arthur\\'s manipulative genius. Instead, they serve as more of a backdrop for the film\\'s plot rather than being a pivotal turning point in the narrative.By the time Harley Quinn abandons Arthur, it feels like the central relationship has been underdeveloped. Her departure from him because he refuses to fully embrace the Joker persona doesn\\'t carry the emotional weight it should. It leaves the audience questioning what the point of their relationship was in the first place. Their dynamic is a critical part of the Joker\\'s mythology, and in this film, it feels as though the filmmakers only scratched the surface.A Lack of Direction and Purpose\\nOne of the major problems with Joker: Folie à Deux is its lack of a clear, coherent message or purpose. At the end of the film, it\\'s hard to pinpoint exactly what the director was trying to convey. Unlike the first Joker, which offered a raw, gritty look into Arthur Fleck\\'s descent into madness and his transformation into the Joker, this sequel seems to lack that same clarity of vision.It\\'s true that Arthur, as the Joker, manages to \"transmit\" his delusional beliefs to many of his followers, both outside and inside the courtroom and jail. This mirrors the folie à deux concept on a larger societal scale, as Arthur\\'s twisted perspective seems to resonate with the disenfranchised and downtrodden, sparking a kind of mass hysteria. However, this theme, while present, isn\\'t explored in a way that feels meaningful or new. Instead, it feels like a rehash of what we already saw in the first film, but without the same emotional or intellectual punch.Additionally, many characters-including the Joker himself-seem disappointed that Arthur doesn\\'t fully commit to being the Joker. This sense of dissatisfaction pervades much of the film, both within the story and for the audience. There\\'s an expectation that Arthur will fully embrace his chaotic, anarchic nature, but that moment never quite comes, leaving viewers with a sense of incompleteness. The Joker\\'s ultimate failure to live up to the expectations placed upon him feels anticlimactic.An Alternate Universe and Disappointing Ending\\nThe film also creates the sense that this Joker exists in an alternate universe separate from the Batman mythology that fans are familiar with. This alternate universe approach is somewhat jarring and further removes the film from any of the Batman movies we\\'ve grown to love. The ending especially feels disconnected from any broader narrative, as it offers no real sense of closure or continuity with other DC films. For fans hoping for a deeper connection to the larger Gotham mythos, the film\\'s ending will likely feel frustrating and unsatisfying.Moreover, the final scenes, where the Joker\\'s influence on his followers becomes apparent, don\\'t provide enough payoff for the buildup. The film could have approached the Joker\\'s rise to power in a more engrossing way, focusing on the psychological intricacies of Arthur\\'s relationships and the societal consequences of his actions. Instead, it leaves the audience questioning what exactly they were meant to take away from the experience.Final Thoughts\\nUltimately, Joker: Folie à Deux is a film that had immense potential but failed to live up to it. By focusing too much on style over substance-through the musical numbers and underdeveloped relationships-the movie misses the opportunity to explore its central theme of folie à deux in a meaningful way. The courtroom drama, which should have been a central focus, fizzles out, and the much-anticipated relationship between Joker and Harley Quinn lacks the depth and complexity that their shared madness should have conveyed.While Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance remains strong, the film as a whole feels disjointed and unsure of what it wants to say. The idea of Arthur transmitting his delusions to others, while present, isn\\'t fully realized, and the film\\'s ending leaves viewers wondering what the point of it all was. For fans of the first Joker film, Joker: Folie à Deux may feel like a disappointing and unnecessary addition to a story that was already complete.',\n",

The characters at the start are unchanged by the end (if you can call that an end). There's an illusion of journey when in reality it never began.Half of this film is a song sequence. Now, I don't mind musicals, and the symbolism of music is well justified within the film. But by the time the 15th song rolls, it feels like the magician has no more tricks up his sleeve. Symbolism comes at the cost of effective storytelling.With a reported $200 million budget, Joker 2 feels miniscule compared to its predecessor, which outclasses it in nearly every aspect. It has its moments, but the negatives outweigh the positives for me. A narrative mess, a cinematic blunder, and a disservice to the character.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I ADORED the first Joker film. It had such rich themes and great powerful and focused storytelling. When a sequel was announced I was terrified. The first movie was a perfectly contained story. Joker Folie a Deux was not. The musical element of the movie really bogged the film down. It is very unfocused and incoherent. Anytime things started to get interesting someone started singing. The songs played didn't really affect the narrative in a compelling way. Ultimately, this movie was made because of how well the first one did.The movie had great performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga along with great cinematography. But the overall concept and plot felt limiting. They wanted to do something different with a musical but...it didn't work. The characterization of The Joker was abruptly ruined in the 3rd act in my opinion. Whatever development he had in the first movie came crashing down in this one.Overall Joker Folie a Deux was a huge disappointment waiting to happen. A plot desperately trying to captivate but doesn't stop singing.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'This happens when you never embrace the true direction of your film and yet it turns out to be the case. After all the timidity to identify the sequel to the 2019 box office monster a musical, ladies and gentlemen, Joker: Folie à Deux is a musical. But I am not going to clobber, whack, and thump on this film just for its genre because I like a lot of musical films. And I thought those staged sequences we all saw in the trailers should make sense for our two unsound characters. It did not. Even with the undeniable talent of Lady Gaga, whom will bring us to my next point.I was not stirred by the announcement about the sequel until the addition of Harley Quinn. I love these two characters so much, especially as a duo. All toxicities and abuses aside, Joker and Harley Quinn\\'s power was no joke. Casting Lady Gaga did not turn me off. I know how great she is as an actress and a total performer. The craziness of her artistry should add up. Only to learn her character was a stripped version of the inspiration and more akin to Punchline, Harley\\'s replacement as Joker\\'s henchwoman. Lee was underutilized in Joker: Folie à Deux, a victim of poor, shallow writing of her character, nothing but a bait to comic and Harley fans. Props, however, to her dedication for this character that Gaga even produced a full-length companion album (\"The Joker\" currently on repeat). But I\\'m sorry; her chance to an Oscar nom is now improbable.Phoenix was just as scary good as his Oscar-winning performance in the first film. Gleeson was also a standout as one of the Arkham guards. Guðnadóttir\\'s score was kind of subdued this time, but just equally haunting as her work five years ago. It\\'s Lawrence Sher\\'s cinematography I enjoyed in this sequel the most.Joker: Folie à Deux shouldn\\'t have happened. Too much for Todd Phillips\\' experimentalism and boldness only to under-deliver and land tone-deaf. This is hardly my Jarley. I hope that last scene ultimately draws the curtains on this franchise.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"This feels more like a spin-off than a true sequel, spending most of its runtime rehashing the original through court scenes and interviews, rather than pushing the story forward. The writing is serviceable at best, often relying on thin threads to loosely tie one musical dream sequence to the next. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is fine, but it lacks the raw intensity that defined his portrayal in the original. Lady Gaga, on the other hand, seemed to intentionally tone down her usual flamboyance, likely to avoid overshadowing him, which, while understandable, feels like a missed opportunity for a more dynamic performance.The musical numbers, full of energy and spectacle, are easily the highlight of the film, with the singing and dancing offering moments of reprieve from the otherwise sluggish narrative. Unfortunately, these sequences can't sustain the film's momentum. The lack of a substantial plot causes the movie to feel overlong, dragging on for more than two hours, making it feel unnecessarily stretched. Without the gripping psychological tension of its predecessor, the film struggles to find its footing, leaving it more of an indulgent showcase for musical theatrics than a coherent, engaging continuation of the story.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"If there ever was a case for a very successful film not to have a sequel it was Joker directed by Todd Phillips. This film was not supposed to work but it did. The 2019 original was a huge success. It was a a comic book villains origin story but not really. It was a Joker film in the world of Martin Scorsese. Sort of Joker meets Taxi Driver. What Joaquin Phoenix did with his performance is legend. It's a great performance. It made so much money that there was no way that they wouldn't make a sequel. This stand alone Joker film did not need one. But we got it anyway.The problem is that this new film Joker: Folie à Deux as it is called is pretty much a repudiation of the film that spawned it. The film is well made and again Joaquin Phoenix is great as Arthur Fleck/Joker but the direction that Phi The film is starts in Arkham State Hospital about 4 years after the events in the first film. We meet Lee. Supposedly Harley Quinn played by Lady Gaga. Arthur and Lee have an instant attraction but then the film becomes a musical. This is for me when the film goes wrong. The musical numbers though well done are not really there to advance the story. They are supposedly or not in Arthur's head they mostly ruin any dramatic weight in the film. There are a couple that fit well but the rest just make the film feel slower. I admit I really don't like musicals but this dud not fit. A couple well placed numbers would have been enough. But Phillips made this a musical. As much as he says it isn't. It is. Arthur is battling with his dual persona. Is he Arthur or Joker? That would have been great to explore but the film is too busy with the musical scenes that there is no focus on it. Lady Gaga is good in the film but she brings nothing special to her role except that she can sing. It's obvious why she was cast. But there is not really any arc fur her character.There are some interesting directions this film could have gone but it seems that the only thing Todd Phillips was interested in is deconstructing what he built in the first film. Joker was a character study but it had a sense of danger. Joker: Folie à Deux has a couple of scenes that have that sense of danger but the film is so caught up in being a musical that all of that is lost.I understand that this film is getting savages as a complete disaster. I disagree that it's terrible but it's clear that it's a film that shouldn't have been made. It seems that these days a film like this is either loved or hated. I certainly did love it but I didn't hate it either.The first Joker was great as a stand alone film. It was technically in the Batman universe but it was very much about Arthur becoming Joker. It proved that a film that was about a comic book character could world work as something other than an escapist fantasy. Joker: Folie à Deux seems to exist to revert what was done in the first film.They should have left the first one as the only film in this iteration of the character.Not horr, but disappointint and unnecessary....Grade: C.\",\n",

I\\'ll start by saying that musicals aren\\'t really my thing, but I knew going in that this would be one. The musical segments didn\\'t detract from the story, but it did feel like one or two of them started a bit prematurely. I understand that these scenes represent Arthur\\'s imagination, so it makes sense that they might begin at odd moments. Still, the viewer\\'s experience needs to be taken into consideration.When I first walked out of the theater, I was thinking, \"What did I just watch?\" But after giving it more thought and reflecting on the scenes and how they build up, the full picture becomes clearer, and you start to appreciate it more. As expected, the acting was incredible, and the cinematography and color grading were outstanding. However, I do feel like Lady Gaga was underutilized. It\\'s not that she lacked screen time, but I think her character could have been explored more deeply.The deeper dive into Arthur\\'s backstory was a nice touch, offering more context to his character. Despite some of the criticism, I believe it\\'s better than many people give it credit for, though it doesn\\'t quite reach the perfection of the first film.

Reading more about the ending and seeing other people\\'s interpretations helped me appreciate it even further.If you take the time to analyze the film beyond the surface level, you can really see and appreciate what Todd Phillips was aiming for. That said, I think the criticisms are valid.

       "    'Review': \"After hearing about how Joker: Folie À Deux has been received, and feeling like it was going to be a massive let-down, I found that it really wasn't that bad.Joker: Folie à Duex is filmed in much the same way as the first Joker movie. It is moody and dark, and it delves more into the mentality of Arthur after his actions in the first movie. However, this time, it has been turned into a bit of a musical. And it is there in which this movie creates its own problems.Musically, there is a lot to enjoy. It has a very good soundtrack, and the on-screen performances during the musical parts are pretty good. However, I feel that some of those musical parts were unnecessary, a couple felt forced, and ultimately, I think there were maybe two too many musical performances in the movie.I didn't care none too much about Harley's character (aka Lee) and how she was introduced, though Lady Gaga did act her part very well, and her singing is great. It is a shame that the writers didn't introduce her character in a way that his cult following was towards the end of the last movie. Here, they chose to drop Lee into the story in a way that didn't really make use of that factor and, instead, dropped her in as someone who seemed a little fascinated or obsessed with Arthur.This dynamic works in places, especially when they're getting to know each other, but it gives you a false sense of security in their blossoming relationship because later on in the film it is unexpectedly broken with some relative ease.I don't want to get into too much with this review because I don't want to include spoilers. It is a movie that is worth a watch if you are fine with musicals. I think it received a bit hate because I believe fans of the first movie were probably expecting some kind of evolution in Arthur, turning into the killer and public nuisance most synonymous in the various iterations of Batman, and potentially becoming more twisted as the movie went on.It is nothing like that.Instead we have a movie that is interesting and brave in its direction but ultimately it doesn't pay off.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'In 2019, Todd Phillips\\' \\'Joker\\' took the world by storm. A moody origin story for the infamous Batman villain- as well as a powerful examination of mental illness- the film grossed over a billion dollars at the box office, and is still the second highest grossing R-rated film of all time. Superbly acted and beautifully shot, the drama- inspired by the films of Martin Scorsese, most evidently \\'The King of Comedy\\' and \\'Taxi Driver\\'- received near unanimous praise, from viewers and critics alike.However, it was not without some critical controversy. Some writers, like Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair, suggested the film was overly sympathetic \"towards white men who commit heinous crimes.\" Others, such as Jim Geraghty of National Review, felt that it would encourage \"America\\'s angry, paranoid, emotionally unstable young men\" to commit crimes like the ones depicted in Phillip\\'s narrative.Despite this, most concede that the film acted as a poignant, cautionary tale; showing how a societal disregard for the vulnerable can create someone as dangerous as Arthur Fleck, aka: Joker. In this way, it was an important film, that actually had something to say (which the majority of Phillip\\'s previous directorial features largely hadn\\'t). This made it something of a rarity in the landscape of comic-book adaptations- as did the fact that Phillips never intended to follow it up with a sequel.A rarity and a gamble, for studios want a sure thing. Indeed, it must have been incredibly difficult to get Warner Brothers to pony up the dough for a dark, stand-alone comic book adaptation in the age of the Marvel movie; where certainty is measured by quips, meta-humour and familiarity. That Phillips got \\'Joker\\' made- combined with its whirlwind success- seemed to be a harbinger of sorts; heralding that smaller stories could be just as affecting and as successful as the juggernaut Marvel franchise; proving that not everything actually needs a sequel.However, in Hollywood need is dictated by profitability; and if anything makes over one billion at the box office, a sequel will surely follow whether viewers, or the filmmakers, necessarily feels one is really warranted.Hence \\'Joker: Folie à Deux,\\' which, if the original was a gamble, is like a game of Russian Roulette with half the chambers loaded: a very risky business indeed. Whereas the first \\'Joker\\' was a dark psychodrama following Arthur Fleck on his descent into madness, \\'Folie à Deux\\' is a musical, detailing Fleck\\'s struggles with his dual identity in the run up to his trial for murder, alongside his number one fan, fellow inmate and love interest Harleen \\'Lee\\' Quinzel.Off the bat, credit must be given to Phillips for taking such a risk and going in a new direction, genre-wise. He and fellow screenwriter Scott Silver could have easily rested on their laurels, simply remaking the first film all over again, knowing it was a blueprint for success (as has been happening with the Marvel movies since- what now feels like- the dawn of time). That they decided to make a musical of all things takes genuine guts and, while perhaps foolhardy, must be applauded. It\\'s a massive swing, that not many directors would take.A massive swing that doesn\\'t exactly result in a hit. The first film had an engaging, tightly plotted narrative, with a compelling central character whose story arc felt organic and real. The sequel feels scattershot in comparison, as if Phillips and Silver weren\\'t sure what to do with Fleck and Quinzel, nor in which direction their story should head. The musical numbers within- and the runtime seems to be at least 50% song and dance- are routinely strong and emotionally resonant, though often feel like padding.Phillips has stated that Fleck sings when he can\\'t find \"the words to say what he wants to say,\" though, to a cynical viewer, it seems that Fleck sings because Phillips and Silver realized their narrative was too slim to justify a runtime of two hours and eighteen minutes. Indeed, much of proceedings are centred on characters recounting events from the first film, or consist of direct flashbacks.In addition, the idea- hastily introduced at a late stage- that Fleck may not be comfortable being turned into an icon at the expense of his own personality is shoehorned into the cigarette-paper-thin veneer of a plot. This feels at odds with his established character as a whole and, especially, the ending of the first film. Furthermore, the trial sequence- bar an extended scene featuring Gary Puddles, the diminutive clown from the original- is surprisingly dull and forgettable.Having said that, the doomed central relationship between Fleck and Lee is a genuinely affecting one. There have been on screen relationships between arguably insane characters before- Mickey and Mallory in \\'Natural Born Killers\\' and Lula and Sailor in \\'Wild At Heart\\' come to mind- but rarely are they as grounded and as tender as Fleck and Lee\\'s. Had the narrative around them been stronger, or if he and Silver had been more assured with regard to the film\\'s message; Phillips would have had a great work on his hands.Unfortunately, as it is, \\'Folie à Deux\\' lacks enough substance to make its own mark, outside the shadow of its predecessor. This is not to say, however, that it doesn\\'t have anything going for it. As mentioned above, the musical numbers are heartbreakingly performed and expertly choreographed. A sequence involving a Sonny & Cher-style variety-show is a stand out, as well as a devastating moment when Fleck recites \\'Ne me Quitte pas\\' into a courthouse phone.Additionally, Mark Friedberg\\'s production design atmospherically creates a seedy, cold Gotham City, where hope is a rare commodity; and love even rarer. Moreover, Lawrence Sher\\'s striking cinematography recalls the first film, though his use of stylizations and colour makes \\'Folie à Deux\\' a distinct beast; more like the films of Gene Kelly than Martin Scorsese (that Sher has mentioned Francis Ford Coppola\\'s ill-fated musical \\'One from the Heart\\' as inspiration is unsurprising, though also bitterly ironic).Furthermore, the performances are all incredible. Joaquin Phoenix once again powerfully portrays the complexities of a damaged mind, and is electrifying. Intense, nuanced and sadly believable, he carries the film squarely on his shoulders. Lady Gaga does similarly fine work opposite him as Lee, credibly bringing to life a borderline psychotic with aplomb. The madness in her eyes is disconcerting, and she has rarely been better on film. She and Phoenix work well together, performing the various musical numbers masterfully, whether together or apart.In addition, Brendan Gleeson does typically sterling work as the sadistic prison guard Jackie Sullivan; elevating what many other actors would have played as a straight villain into one of the film\\'s more interesting characters. Catherine Keener impresses greatly as the film\\'s only real \\'good\\' character, Fleck\\'s lawyer Maryanne Stewart, while Harry Lawtey brings the smug DA Harvey Dent to life well; even if the character is as generic as cardboard.Moreover, Leigh Gill\\'s excellent, impassioned performance as Gary Puddles in the film\\'s best scene lingers long after the credits have rolled, while Zazie Beetz\\'s strong work as Fleck\\'s original love interest Sophie is similarly impressive. Both deserved more screen time. Contrastly, although Steve Coogan has made his bread-and-butter playing smarmy characters, from Alan Partridge to Tony Wilson, his stereotypical American accent as journalist Paddy Meyers is jarring; though he\\'s still effective.In conclusion, Todd Phillip\\'s \\'Joker: Folie à Deux\\' could potentially have been a great film, were it not for its weak narrative and familiar plotting. Where 2019\\'s \\'Joker\\' ran, it crawls, often straying into the drab territory of the underwhelming. Despite lush cinematography and terrific performances, it comes as a bitter let-down. Although the songs are admittedly well-performed, they fundamentally feel like filler in a film that doesn\\'t know what it wants to be. It is neither as clever nor as controversial as its predecessor and- in comparison, sadly- decidedly disappointing. In the end, although it took guts, why Phillips made the film as a musical is not a folie à deux, rather a folie d\\'un seul- which makes the joke on the audience.',\n",

       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" really surprised me. I went in with low expectations, already influenced by some negative reviews I had heard, but the truth is, the film managed to exceed them.What captivated me the most was how the movie diverges from the classic DC villain narrative, focusing instead on the exploration of Arthur Fleck\\'s mental instability. It\\'s a bold psychological dive, and I wasn\\'t expecting Todd Phillips to take such a risk with something so close to a musical. Even more surprising was Warner Bros. Allowing such audacity, which makes me think it might have been the price to pay to secure Joaquin Phoenix for the sequel.The film itself feels like a brilliant metaphor for what I see happening in reality: just as Gotham yearns for the Joker, audiences also expect the Joker to follow a specific, predetermined story. The way people project their own desires and glorify figures for a particular purpose is very well portrayed.Joaquin Phoenix, as always, is incredible as the Joker, but the biggest surprise was Lady Gaga. She delivered a solid and convincing performance, even if somewhat understated. The cinematography remains consistent, although some of the musical moments fall short, slightly breaking the film\\'s rhythm.The ending, however, felt forced. I got the sense that there was an imposed need to create a final showdown between Arthur and Harley, and the only way to get there was by relying on the typical superhero movie spectacle, with \"deus ex machina\" moments that could have been avoided.Final rating: 3/5.',\n",

I would agree the first film is stronger it has a overall stronger direction I would say but at the same time I still enjoyed this film more than a lot of other people seem to. Joaquin Phoenix is really great as expected he was really great in the original joker film and lady Gaga did a pretty great job as Harley Quine she still isent as great as Margot Robbie's Harley Quine but she was really good and fit the film. This film definitely Doesn't have nearly as strong of a direction as the first one it kind of just keeps going and then stops and then goes again but it's still not bad I don't think this is that bad of a sequel. So yeah I enjoyed the movie for what it was I didn't think it was that bad.\",\n",

However, it was way too long and had way too many and too long music numbers, that often didn\\'t even make sense. There was so much about cigarettes that it felt like an infomercial by the tobacco industry. (I hated that part.)I am glad we went to see this movie. It provided some interesting perspectives. The arch of Harley Quinn and The Joker seemed very authentic. Even the interactions with the Arkham Prison guards was very real (and I had that job for 2 years.). Billy\\'s testimony was extremely moving and obviously changed everything. I did expect a scene in to appear in the credits and was disappointed not to appear. It looked like the \"shiv guy\" was cutting his smile onto his face to become the new Joker. I thought the director was going to codify that scene during the credits.',\n",

Joaquin Phoenix still caries the movie, along with Todd Philips' directing. Lady Gaga is a better singer than actress; she always seem to act as the same person.The Batman villiams are my favorite in all of comics. The Joker has alwasys stood alone, due to on screen performances from Jack, Heath, Barry (tiny deleted scene), and now Joaquin.IMDB's rating system is pretty generic. I should be able to rate this movie in 0.1 increments. I give this movie a 6.6. I gave Joker1 an eight.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"You are here to feel validated for not liking the movie. You will find that validation when you see the quantity of 1 stars and poor reviews. The film is not a masterpiece, but it is not a bad film. Maybe it's just not the movie you wanted. Maybe it doesn't care as much about the legacy of the joker comic villain as much as you may. Maybe you don't like musicals. I don't know what your problem is, but chill out.The film was inconsistent, but the acting perfromances, Gleeson in particular, are what in my opinion set this movie from being average, to being a decent film. There's a lot of bad film. A lot of over the top super hero movies. It's almost refreshing to see a played out villain story where we expect so many things due to our familiarity with the adapted literature, turned into a boring court room drama with some musical components. Really subverted my expectations, and I found myself laughing at just the idea of that, which is genius, because the production company, had to know this would piss off so many nerds and incels and low iq americans who devour action movies like cheesburgers.The movie wasn't deep, im not saying that, but i did enjoy the critism of american symbolisation and fanaticism. I didn't love it, but I enjoyed my viewing. I tend to not love musicals and I didn't really like the first joker, but this one was funnier, more tragic, and a good fall date night movie to share and drink beers to.\",\n",

I get that there is supposed to be some music in the movie, because that is the Jokers kind of personality. But when they added lady Gaga it felt like they had to add even more musical scenes and songs to the movie, where some didn't make sense for the story line. They were just added to use lady Gaga's voice basically. And the story never got anywhere. Arthur ended where he started, so no progression at all. One guy at YouTube mentioned that the best scene was deifnilty the one with Mr puddles which I agree upon. I expected some kind of Harley Quinn movie but didn't feel like it was. And the fact that lady Gaga was the one using Arthur in the end felt like a weird plot. Or I didn't like it at least. Ok movie, not very exciting watch. Don't need to watch it again.\",\n",

Explaining how, Harley walking out of the courtroom mirrors how the audience walks out because there disappointed that the Joker gave up the act and was only Arthur all along.I get it.The reason this sequel will lose money is not because its a musical which I actually enjoyed. Its not because of the stars performance. Its not because the movie was poorly written or directed. Its because of one simple reason:The audience wanted to see the rise of Joker, the embrace of who we have known him to be since his creation in DC comics.Instead we watched the Joker raped out of him, renounce the Joker, and then quickly killed off.Perhaps this could have been his ending down the road, maybe in a 3rd film? It was a sharp, abrupt U-turn from the first film and it should be of no surprise to anyone that it wasn\\'t well received.I enjoyed it. I don\\'t think its a bad movie, but the reason why it failed is simple.Again, I know this proves the point of the writers. But this is a made up comic book villain... We wanted THAT story.

Sure, some people argue that \"Joker\" is an idea but let\\'s be real, that\\'s a cheap sell.The Joker IS a person, a popular villain, and people wanted to dive into that Joker specifically. Both of these movies is about a random guy pretending to be him.Aside from that both movies is about suffering, mental issues, and coping and it\\'s actually pretty good at that. This could easily be it\\'s own show (and probably should have been). It\\'s pretty much another crime/suspense show on most streaming platforms but slapped with the \"Joker\" title on top.The musical parts were also pretty weird. It\\'s supposed to represent his sanity and fantasies but it took too much of the spotlight. It\\'s almost as if they ran out of script and decided to pad the rest of the movie with singing and dancing to make the movie longer.Personally I think the twist took away from the character. I wanted to dive into the life of the real Joker, not follow some depressed man around pretending to be him. This is exactly how Lee felt towards the end of the movie when she walked out on Arthur because she found out he\\'s been a phony.

       "    'Review': \"The Joker sequel has to be one of the least wanted sequels in a long time - and boy, is it unnescessary!When I first heard about them making a sequel and making it a musical I was sceptical but still curious with caution to see what they would make of it. The general idea of the jokers mind being portrayed through musical numbers was promising - and very much in character in my opinion. However, the execution of this film was far from great.Firstly, I want to applaud the performance once again from Joacquin Phoenix who still plays the roll of Arthur Fleck to perfection, he has not phoned it in for this sequel. Lady Gaga made a good contribution too - when she actually gets to act. She has unfortunately not been giving much to act on and the focus is more on the musical aspects, since Lady Gaga is a musician after all. She is a great actress and it's a shame they didn't let her act more.The cinematography, lighting and assets, choregraphy and music is great in this film.Where Joker: Folie a Deux really stumbles is in the story department. It really adds NOTHING new to the first film, it's basically the same film as the first one retold. Todd Philips does NOT know how to make good sequels, it seems. An example I can think of is The Hangover films, who did not need sequels, and once they came out, they basically were the same films. No character progression, no additional story features that we did not already know about, it has NO substance what so ever. It's a shame because the musical aspect is really interesting to me. Unfortunately, the story falls flat, does not add anything and the musical numbers also felt quite abrupt at times, like they were just thrown in there for the sake of a musical, which ruined the pacing as well.This film is not as bad as people depict it to be, however. It's an all right enough film that unfortunately gets bogged down by the awful writing, pacing, and general direction. The ending of this film (no spoiler here) is also a very strange, and to be honest, badly written one. It felt like fan-fiction.It is completely unnescessary and should not really exist. If you've seen the first one, then you can expect that the second film is just the first one being retold through a courtroom drama / musical numbers. You won't get much out of it. I enjoyed it for what it was, even if it wasn't what I expected, and I don't think this movie is deserving of the low rating it has. It deserves at least a 6, which i base my rating on. I would give it a 6,5 but I can't rate it like that here.Short summary:Story - 2/10\\nMusic - 8/10\\nActing - 10/10\\nCinematography - 8/10.\",\n",

Joker goes to trial. Harley puts Joker on a pedestal and Joker shines infront of a crowd. & Then it all comes crashing down in the final 30 minutes or so, I not only don't like the ending so much it made me drop my review score by 2 points, I just don't understand why the filmmaker chose to do it, it's not even an original idea we have seen it done before.

Probably would have been best just to call this joint the Clown and leave Batman's Rogue out of it.Funny thing is there was a lot of potential to appeal to Fanboys, but they did not take it, in a move that felt pompous on the filmmaker's side. If you hate comic book superhero movies that much then why'd you do one?I did not hate Lady Gaga's version of Harley Quinn, in fact overall her connecting story arch with the joker made this movie worth seeing, but still, this is not the original DC animated Universe version or the comic book version. Truly, this is someone else who may have been better received in another movie.And to think, my biggest worry going in is that i hate musicals and hoped if Gaga was doing some of it I would tolerate it. Not even worth mentioning it! It does not make sense why it even needed to be a musical. Were the musical ques met to metaphorically allow me to enter the heads of the two main characters or was it a poorly done trick to make a film seem artier and more interesting? Definitely both!Sometimes lighting can't strike twice and the funniest thing about this film is how far from the mark they missed it!Don't sit through this.\",\n",

I don't mind the singing/music, I think a few were out of place, but otherwise okay to give atmosphere.So the main character was missing - Fleck's development was a psychologically, exciting drive in Joker (2019), and there was also action, but here things almost came to a standstill.So basically lack of action - and the absence of the main character in Joker-apperance.The acting was great, but the screenplay nothing like the first movie.Was this a villain in a superhero movie from Gotham city?

They are both in a hospital and playing out their fantasies for the most part in their minds so why does that not seem like a good way to approach it?It builds up towards the third act and the last bit is super sad but when and IF you can open your mind and realize these are mental health patients expressing themselves then maybe you will understand and appreciate the movie better.I\\'m so sick and tired of movies getting hate and people find like 1 thing to make it sound like the entire movie is ruined because of it.I don\\'t care for musicals but I do for dark ones such as Sweeney Todd with Johnny Depp. If you enjoyed that one then you\\'ll enjoy Joker 2.This film almost could have been a stand alone to if it didn\\'t rely on repeating his crimes from the first film because even Arthur Fleck said he is done focusing on his past.Anyways that\\'s my two cents. Do what you will and listen to critics or go see it for yourself and go in open minded.',\n",

Instead they attempt to recreate a masterpiece from memory with crippling Alzheimer's.The musical scenes that many are so interested in reviewing, take up a good sum of screen time and serve as a way to show us the Folie à Deux in action. Unfortunately these moments pull you from the pacing and cause Joker Folie à Deux to feel drug out and sluggish.The film would get a lower score from me had the last 15/20 minutes not been amazing. And I mean that. The last 15/20 minutes is a masterpiece and had they done that for the whole film, it would have been another Oscar winner. Instead, unfortunately it is a failure.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"'The Joker: Folie à Deux' is a movie that promises much plot in the life of 'Arthur Fleck' - 'The Joker' after he gets imprisoned in the mental illness institution and now is trying to be the leader of the symbol of anarchy.But the promised plot didn't went well that way:The movie starts with Arthur Fleck being in the mental illness institution and feeling alienated from his daily routine.In fact, he starts to seem depressed until he meets Harley Quinn singing in a music club - being imprisoned but not for the same conditions as Arthur Fleck as well.He seems to feel hope in himself and tries to breakout of prison with Harley Quinn - but they fail which provides consequences but fall in love instead.A few days after, Arthur Fleck gets to know he should be assigned a death penalty. This pressure onto himself makes him feel tortured and being led in Court to figure out if he is worth the guilty.While being in trial in court, an event happens in which the hall is being blown up. - Arthur uses the chance and escapes but fails lately after.In the last sequences, Arthur is asked by a prison mate if he wants to hear a joke, he said yes - but being killed after by the prison mate.The Movie doesn't really give the main effect of Arthur Fleck being The Joker. Instead, the first half of the Movie, Arthur Fleck doesn't really seems to being written motivated by the script writer.Also, the Character Harley Quinn isn't really shown at all as 'Harley Quinn' is as in the Comics.Much people thought of a team working together within The Joker and Harley Quinn doing criminal things as a result of the movie, but instead the whole film is only about live in prison and the court trial.This written script contains a 'slowly-evolving-story-process' feeling for the viewer by the movie that turns later out to be 'dramatically different' as the fans thought.Furthermore, the given death by the Joker doesn't really feel to being written well that much - it seems to were being written under much pressure and turns the whole story into a senseless ending -An untapped potential of the film.In conclusion, the movie seems to deal with alienation, mental illness and court trials. All fast written words of the film have a certain meaning to the movie and contains sometimes criticism.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Directed and co-written by Todd Phillips. A runtime of two hours and eighteen minutes. With an R rating.\"Arthur Fleck,\" played by Joaquin Phoenix, is being held at \"Arkham Asylum\" awaiting trial for the heinous crimes he committed in the first film.\"Arthur\\'s\" popularity is at its highest. His lawyer, \"Maryanne Stewart,\" played by Catherine Keener, is trying to get a responsible defense against the prosecutor, \"Harvey Dent,\" played by Harry Lawtey.The guards in \"Arkham\" can be hit or miss, but correctional officer \"Jackie Sullivan,\" played by Brendan Gleeson, gets \"Arthur\" in a class where he meets fellow patient \"Lee Quinzel,\" played by Lady Gaga.You watch as the trial of the century takes place in \"Gotham.\" Along with how \"Arthur\" wrestles with a mix of emotions and his fandom. All while falling in love with \"Lee.\" In this musically inspired sequel.\"Joker: Folie à Deux\" was a tease. It had the template for something magical. I mean, you saw the first film. But this one dropped the ball overall.I\\'m not a huge steak eater. But I hear the true steak lovers say if you have a good steak, you don\\'t need A1 sauce on it. The first film was a tomahawk; they just needed to cook it the same, maybe add some different sides. Instead, they added a crap ton of A1 sauce and drowned out the whole steak. You could taste how good the steak was in spots, but your taste buds would get thrown off by the mouthful of A1 sauce you were consuming.I get it. Todd Phillips isn\\'t following the comics per se. He made the first film about mental health. It was a unique and real take on a villain we all know. In this film, with Lady Gaga, I was so excited because she can act with the best of them. We saw how the first film ended, so I expected or at least wanted them to terrorize the city together.Todd Phillips went in the exact opposite direction. I did not like his creative vision for this film. At all. When I heard it was a musical, I was confused. This just seemed like adding something unnecessary to an excellent film already.Every time I got into what was going on, then a random musical number would appear. It got annoying. Some of the music went along with the flow, but others derailed the pace and feel of the scene. The acting was so good I wanted to see more, especially at pivotal moments. Just for me to constantly get something that didn\\'t fit. It\\'s a lot of music. Joaquin Phoenix can hold a note. But I just didn\\'t think this film called for it.If the first film is about becoming \"Joker,\" then this film is about returning to \"Arthur Fleck.\" They had some really good ingredients in this film. You could tell they paid a pretty penny to film it. I didn\\'t like the vision for \"Harley Quinn.\" I mean \"Lee.\" I liked them adding \"Harvey Dent.\" He was a tool, by the way.I\\'m not a huge musical fan. I still could appreciate some of the musical numbers. But you\\'re alienating a huge chunk of your original fan base to make this move.Overall, the acting is phenomenal; you just wish they focused more on that than the music. Joaquin said it was hard to film because losing weight was fine, but now adding all this dancing and singing makes it extremely hard to film.Lady Gaga said she had to switch her singing voice up and sing with a completely different tone. You could tell, but her iconic sound still came out a couple of times.It\\'s not all bad, but it\\'s far from great too. Mental health is a huge component of this film. It was still extremely deep. The music isn\\'t bad; it just felt unnecessary. If you enjoy musicals, you will probably like this film.By the very end, I expected any scene I loved to get ruined by a musical routine. I was over it and kind of down on how it ended. Todd Phillips had a masterpiece. If they were going to go so drastic then they should\\'ve done it the first film or just not do a second film. A decision I know they wish they could redo. Someone should have said, \"Hey, you know you don\\'t have to add all this extra stuff, your meal is already delicious\". I give this film three mor fires 🔥🔥🔥.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin\\n#CosmoMovieBlog\\n#CosmoLanier\\n#JokerFolieADeux.',\n",

One or two songs are fine but it just reduces the phase of movie. The director todd is trying to convey something which in my point didnt work out, real poor screenplay. Lady gaga would have been avoided in this film, her performance is ok but thought she was forced to do this film which didnt connect. The impact and feel what we had from Joker 1 was surreal, it still impacts us a lot. This film toattly damaged the reputation. Phoenix oh man he is Jesus of acting. The only positivity was phoenix and his performances throughout the movie. Hope it becomes better later. Director Todd has really disappointed the audience. Pls do watch it if u really want available in theaters. Another demerit of the film is that many questions not answered not a perfect end.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker Folie À Deux is a bold and ambitious sequel and I really respect just how creative this film is. Just like the first movie Todd Phillips killed it in the directors chair and the cinematography is the most beautiful I've seen all year. Joaquin Phoenix returns to play Joker and he does a great job. I also really like Joker's character arc in this film of coming to terms with who he is compared to who he wants to be. Lady Gaga brought her phenomenal acting chops to her portrayal of Harley Quinn and she did a great job with what she was given. However she wasn't really given all that much. This version of Harley Quinn was inconsistently written and underdeveloped. Her motivation makes less sense as the movie goes on and the character really is Harley Quinn in name only. She doesn't really act anything like the Harley Quinn we have grown to know and love over the years. This brings me to my problems with the script in general. This is a movie that hits you over the head with what it's trying to say. This is a film all about Arthur Fleck growing as a person and trying to be more than the Joker persona that he used to start a movement. There is definitely some interesting social commentary but all the slow burn subtlety from the first film is thrown out and exchanged for loud and obnoxious messaging that feels like a script trying to check boxes and not a natural story. This is frustratingly obvious with the ending of the movie where one of Joker's followers feels betrayed and stabs him to death. I also don't understand why Harley Quinn didn't just kill Joker instead of that random guy. It would've felt more natural and personal while still representing what that message was supposed to be. The movie's pacing also feels off. I think a lot of that has to do with the musical numbers which just feel kind of pointless and unnecessary. Since the musical numbers don't add much of anything to the story they just make the movie drag. The music isn't very memorable or interesting which doesn't help either. However the musical set pieces look great. The production design is great all around, and same goes for the makeup. The costumes are hit or miss for me personally. The costumes during the musical sequences are pretty cool but most of Joker and Harley's outfits are kind of bland, especially the more modern take on Harley's red and black outfit. Overall this is a well made movie from most aspects of film making. While I don't think it deserves the immense hatred that it's getting it definitely has problems. The movie is focused on a messy script and the clunky pacing just highlights how messy it is. The fact that the first movie is so much better also hurts this movie a bit too.\",\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': 'An unnecessary coda to a cast-iron masterpiece',\n",
       "    'Review': 'Let\\'s begin by saying that this film is nowhere near as bad as many as insisting. The original Joker is a stand-alone masterpiece that didn\\'t need a follow-up but was forced to have one due to it\\'s colossal financial success. That accepted, Todd Phillips appears to have been of the attitude that, \"You want a sequel? I\\'ll give you a sequel!\" approaching this second flick with the same anarchic irreverence that Arthur Fleck himself might approve of.What we end up with is a bizarre love-story musical / courtroom drama hybrid, interspersed with show-tunes and dance sequences imagined by Joker as he enters the throes of love, having finally found a soul-mate (or so he thinks). The problem is that few of the musical numbers propel the story forwards or even add to it, not least of all because there\\'s very little story to shift. There\\'s an amusing rendition of \"If My Friends Could See Me Now\" and a genuinely poignant and fragile version of Jacques Brel\\'s \"If You Go Away\", but Lady Gaga is pretty much under-used, and Phoenix is certainly no singer.In terms of drama, the film merely treads water, though the scenes outside the courtroom and prison smack beautifully of the same dark, dank imagery used so superbly in the first film. What this means is that we have some excellent atmosphere but no real substance, at least for most of the 140 minutes on offer. For much of the time, the audience is left intrigued by certain ideas - about where the film might be going - but so much is left unrealised, that a sense of disappointment is probably unavoidable.However, the real reason why Joker: Folie a Deux might leave lovers of the first film so disillusioned is that the former undoes much of what Joker presented. If Joker was the tale of a desperately unhappy, abused and lonely man finally finding his voice and identity through his own insanity, this sequel drags Arthur back to reality - to the point where he has to face who and what he actually is. In that respect, Phillips, Phoenix et al deserve huge credit for an audacious attempt to give the public what the do NOT want - to make even the biggest fans of the first movie realise that they weren\\'t watching what they thought they were watching all along. That alone is an incredible attempt at something different and deserves credit.Does the film succeed? Not really. There again, to quote Malcolm McLaren, \"Better to be a spectacular failure than any kind of benign success.\"',\n",

       "    'Review': \"This is a very hard movie to review, I don't think it's Horrible. I do think that the vast majority are exaggerating just a little bit. This movie is very much a musical just like it was marketed , for anybody that didn't like musicals ahead of it were set up for disappointment and it doesn't really help with the fact that I don't think the music elements are used greatly in the movie, instead of progressing the plot or the story, it kind of felt like it was slowing it down, which is where I understand why it can cause huge frustration. I'm not bothered by musicals but I want to point out that it did become a little infuriating because of how repetitive it felt. It was used more in this movie to show us what's going on inside Arthur's mind, it's a great concept but I think it could've been executed a little bit better.The prize for the most controversial movie of maybe not even the year this whole decade so far goes to this movie. I can at least think we'll all agree that the movie looks absolutely beautiful. If you watch this an IMAX, at least we got that . It is visually stunning, every single shot, unlike most comic book movies actually kind of felt like it was shot with some kind of personality by an actual director rather than a factory made product. I'm looking at you Marvel.Now this is where I lean into Lady Gaga, I think she was good, but she wasn't exactly in the movie that much, I wouldn't say she was underutilized but I did expect a much bigger role for her in the movie. Being the famous artist that she is, the soundtrack was certainly disappointing. I did expect to be a lot more extravagant and memorable walking out of that movie. I think I just remember one of the songs which considering this IS a musical. I was a little let down by that.Another thing I'll give the movie and Todd Phillips is guts because in a way it does kind of feel like the movie is a slap to the face to the people that highly enjoyed the first one. This movie plays around the idea that us as audience are similar to the people of Gotham, we want to see this joker persona, we want to be entertained, we want to see the chaos rather than seeing this man actually heal and better himself. Which considering the reception the movie is getting it might be sick enough to make sense, I'm not sure.Heavily established now in this movie, Arthur Fleck was not the joker, this was the story of of the tragic life of a man filled with past trauma and deep psychological issues, who sort of uses this fantasy world, this fantasy character to be able to escape from his pain and suffering. And for me, that's why I wasn't totally mad about the way it ended. I knew Harley would eventually leave him, that could be seen from a mile away, but what I was surprised by, was his death by the hands of what could be the REAL JOKER. I definitely didn't know how to feel about it in the beginning when it happened, but I've come to terms with it. I'm fine with it, but I can see how people may think it's stupid way to end this iteration of the joker. The reason I'm okay with is because I see it as the same way this iteration of the joker started, sad and depressing, meaningless, a tragic death to a man with an awful life from the moment it began.\",\n",

The problem is, and this is the biggest oversight in Phillips\\'s way of thinking, that audiences worldwide chose Arthur as their new Joker.The idea of switching his creation for Christopher Nolan\\'s - and let\\'s not go around the bush, the Psychopath who ends Arthur\\'s life at the end of this film is none other than Heath Ledger\\'s Joker, is both clever and dumb. First, it makes absolutely no sense when we try to understand both timelines; Phillip\\'s Joker takes place back in the 1980s while Nolan\\'s Joker is thriving in the early 2000s. Second, minimizes completely Arthur\\'s journey leaving him as the pathetic disappointment that inspired the real Clown Prince of Crime.This also means that Ledger\\'s Joker was in his mid-40s??This opens the possibility of a third chapter, that according to Phillips will never happen; at least not with him as Director, where Harley Quinn returns to Arkham as the Psychiatrist she truly is after finding out that Arthur was slain by the new Joker - who is everything she wanted Arthur to be, but couldn\\'t.If instead of musical numbers, and slowly than watching paint dry sequences, this film would\\'ve included that ending - the ending where Harley meets Nolan\\'s Joker and their \"Folie à Deux\" connects. If I had gotten that this film could\\'ve been something truly special.At least to me.Unfortunately, we got this half-cooked thing that feels like a mockery, I think unintentionally, of what should remain as a film classic; 2019 Joker.',\n",

You can't just awkwardly film Phoenix singing poorly and justify it being in a musical. It felt like they didn't know how to actually make a musical at times. Quality over quantity should've been the idea when it came to the songs.Also the ending was a giant middle finger. I'm not saying movies have to have the expected or happy ending - it's more interesting if they don't. But it felt like they didn't give care and just wanted to be contrarian.

       "    'Review': \"Coming from someone who really likes the first Joker, I have to say this movie was very disappointing which is a shame since I genuinely had hope for it after seeing the trailers, even with the fact that it was going to be a musical for some odd reason, I was willing to give this movie a chance. But after seeing the low reviews even before the movie fully came out, I felt a bit upset but unsurprised.I could write a super long list on everything that is bad or just not good about this movie, especially the pointless musical moments, but it really needs to be seen to be believed since there are some people who seem to like this movie, but nothing they could say could defend this movie from being anywhere near great.However all the negatives aside for the moment, I do think there are positive things about this film. It Is genuinely a very well made movie, the visuals are gorgeous, the score and editing I found to be fantastic, I did like the dark tone this movie had, similar to the first. There are also scenes in this that I thought were good. The performances were especially fantastic, even with the weak script that the actors had to work with, the performances, manly Joaquin Phoenix's performance felt oscar worthy. I wouldn't put this movie near the worst comic movie ever made because the movie at least felt unique.I do have a lot more to say about this film but overall, Joker: Folie a Deux belongs on the long list of disappointing sequels.Overall Score: 65/100.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Personally, I enjoyed the musical aspects of the movie and I thought the actors did a great job. I really liked the songs that were chosen, perfect for each part of the movie. I think I understand what the director was envisioning for the movie, but wish there was more action since Joker is such a chaotic character. It's cool seeing the the more mental side of him as to why he did and does what he does, but I wanted more crazy.SPOILER!!!When Arthur gives his monologue to the jurors and states he isnt Joker, that didn't feel like that is something his character would really feel. So him saying that really let down Harley and she left the courtroom and essentially left him when he finds her again. I know Joaquin is notorious for not doing sequels so him doing Joker 2 was cool and different, he did excellent acting. I have a strong feeling he didn't want to do a 3rd so that is why he gets stabbed multiple times in the stomach by another inmate. He appears to die but if he doesn't and there is a 3rd, I hope they stick to the Joker character better. Overall, a good movie with a poor ending.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'To be honest, I only watched Joker 1 because of the reviews people were given for Joker 2, and I wanted to see why people were upset.Author Fleck in the first movie was a mentally ill man who even though he kills six people he exposes the hard life people in Gotham City deal with and how they largely have no chance of living good lives. It\\'s understandable, personally the Joker character is not my type, but it was a good watch.Author is now in prison and is on trial for his murders - did he commit his crimes due to insanity (multiple personality disorder) or did he act with a sound mind and should be executed. Okay simple enough story and personally would have enjoyed a story where they sat in the court for the whole 2 hours discussing the matter similar to how the 12 Angry Men (1957) was directed however they went another way.Before Author attends court, he meets Lee Quinzel, who claimed she had been abused and was put in a mental prison by her crazy mother, they bond over this and make plans that once Author is out, they will live a good life not worrying about the craziness around them. Again, I would have been fine with this even though I could not care less about a love interest, and I seriously don\\'t understand how she truly fits into the story. Lee Quinzel is comparable to tumble girl crazy - had a good upbringing, has a good life but wants something exciting and thus wants to be around actual hard-on-their-luck people to feel like them and be them. Which is why I don\\'t like her; her insertion does not completely flow unless we are looking at an angle of the rich wanting to cosplay the poor or exploit them.Which brings in another part the singing, why was there singing I don\\'t know. Yes, Author liked music however it wasn\\'t necessarily a big part of Joker 1, mainly it was the song \"that life...\" which was used as an emphasis on his horrible life (and for him to dance around - which made him look free in Joker 1) but in this movie, singing is seemingly an integral part like it a musical however it misses a point in that during a musical number we move from scene to scene the songs flow into the next scene - they essentially take out the dialogue and replace it with singing and it transitions (whilst explaining) to a different scene. But here they talked about something and then sang the about same thing and stayed in the same scene PLUS they often sang the \"same songs\" (songs that had the same idea all the time - so it became annoying and repetitive). So yeah, singing was completely unnecessary and did not match the tone of the movie.And then the ending - okay interesting but I kind of did not care after watching 2 hours of everything else.Overall, I did not like the movie. The acting was good, everybody did their job. The singing from Lady Gaga was good (of course) but I did not care for the Author\\'s singing. I do not know what I was expecting but possibly Author working on his comedic material and acquiring a better community inside prison. Or maybe replace Lee Quinzel with Ricky where Ricky does not look up to Joker and rehabilitate together or something because he kept showing up but nothing much to his character.I do like the fact he was made into a \"normal person\" as I do feel like some people overly interpreted Author in the first movie as their hero who stood up against \"the big dogs\" where in reality even though he did do that; he did it because he was being provoked or abused, the man is the definition of what happens when social services don\\'t do their job or funding is cut. He was not a Giga Chad.',\n",

Picking up where we left off Arthur Fleck(in another good turn from Joaquin Phoenix) is in prison at Arkham awaiting trial. However aside from seeing his identity issues between his self and \"The Joker\" themes are introduced of love and music. In a wild card like way is character Lee(the talented Lady Gaga) who\\'s given Arthur the hope and fantasy of love while introducing him to music which is like an escape for Fleck. While all of these themes play out the film has plenty of flashbacks and foreshadowing as Arthur sees it all in the form of his \"Joker\" past and present. Overall any \"D.

They were self aware, stopping short of dragging on and giving an additional dimension madness amongst the looming destruction.The performances are solid all round. The pacing is calculated, allowing us contemplation on Arthur's character and what his new relationship with Quinzel will mean.However, despite what seems like a broiling build up to a cacophony of insanity, this film ultimately bails at its last hurdles and even puts to bed any expectations that another sequal could be the explosive conclusion to a trilogy. Where the original topped off with a bold and manacing statement, this one pulls away. Yet again, this seems entirely self aware. It's a subversion tactic that no one expected but no one wanted, either.We wanted Joker. We got Arthur Fleck.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"No Spoilers...\\n5 years ago JOKER was released and it became an phenomenal sensation throughout the world for it's unique take on character showing harsh reality of this world in a bleak and violent story about an mentally ill character, it was a masterpiece but after that film earned 1B WB forced a sequel that shouldn't have made in the first place..\\nThis film continues the story from 1st film but didn't deliver what it promised rather it becomes a meta movie which mocks the character and audience instead of progressing the story in a meaningful way.. Joaquin pheonix still manage to deliver a steller performance and Lady Gaga was also good but film fails from a storytelling point where nothing really happens which makes audience feel the same way they felt in 2019,Harley Quinn is barely present and appears only here and there only to manipulate Arthur which let nowhere at the end..Arthur is now imprisoned in Arkham Asylum and waiting for his trial where he meets Harley Quinn but after that it becomes just some fantasy filled musical sequences and courtroom drama with an lackluster climax which destroys the legacy of the original film and the character shown in that,maybe a film about Joker and Harley escaping and doing crazy acts would've been received better .. Now I don't have any problems with musical numbers and court room drama scenes were also we'll acted but joker was more of a plot device than an actual being here.. This film should have been about Joker and Harley doing ultimate madness which delivers on its Foile à Deux name which means madness for two.. Twist ending was good but it feels forced instead of earned there were also some deeply disturbing scenes like the first one and dark beautiful cinematography and haunting score is what keeps this film together.. It also makes a point that people will only love you when you act like their own will but if you don't they'll abandon you, and that's what it happening in this movies in real world also audience wanted a Joker who goes on killing spree and doing ultimate madness associated with character instead they got another character study of an mentally ill man that's why the hate.. But Todd Phillips should've known people have already seen this aspect of story 5 years ago and rehasing the same old character study theme won't settle well with audience because they want something new not some old boring crap which didn't even matched the half level of the previous film.. Overall Joker 2 is a good film which completely falls flat due to uninspiring story and over the top deconstruction of the character no one wanted at the first place it was a step backwards instead of going forward after setting up a good ending in the last one..\\nWB should have focused on the real sequels that fans want like MoS 2, JL 2, WW 3 etc instead they wasted 200m dollars at something which shouldn't have existed in the first place...Typical bad WB move.

       "    'Review': 'Without a doubt, Todd Phillips\\'s \"Joker\" was one of the most intense movies of 2019. That focus on the origins of the Batman villain showed him to be not a villain, but the inevitable result of a society that favors the 1% (and it also made one question whether or not Bruce Wayne ever deserved to get treated as a hero). Joaquin Phoenix rightfully earned his Oscar for the role.So now we have a sequel. \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" works best when addressing the criminal (in)justice system. The musical scenes, meanwhile, look out of place for this kind of movie. There are plenty of movies where it works perfectly for the characters to break out into song - even movies dealing with an unpleasant topic - but it doesn\\'t add anything here, even with Lady Gaga giving it her all as Harley Quinn.In conclusion, it\\'s not a terrible movie, but still no comparison to the original.',\n",

We all know lady gaga can sing but she can also act and I feel she was under utilised in this movie and should have morphed into the character she was portraying.

       "    'Review': \"The image, photography, lighting, sound, colors, scenery, shots, symbols, focuses and blurs, interpretations, costumes, makeup and production are MAGNIFICENT. Explosive scenes both in their metaphor and literality, an amazing control of shading, lighting and color, which together with the photography, encourage and solidify my beliefs as to why this footage is an audiovisual marvel. Apart from this, the original plot feels almost empty, the only character I managed to empathize with was the dwarf who had lost his job (which is cool because he's a great character but in the first movie I was able to empathize in a certain moment with The Joker and his mother).The script is so basic that it is not even decent, lacking all that brilliance with which they showed off in the originality of the shots and symbols of abundant moral meaning. The film also fails to have a clear main reflection, no matter how good or entertaining the moments of the songs are, which are vaguely calming and in my opinion they put too much. Furthermore, the ending did not leave me wanting more, or even satisfied. At all. I was expecting a Joker madly in love with Harley, and of course they put him in, because he was already crazy before. The bad thing is that when he falls in love, the character loses all kinds of mischief, insight, and especially his instinct, one of the qualities that made this character such a charismatic icon.I liked it, undeniably; there were parts that I didn't enjoy as much as I would have liked, and they almost seemed tiresome, but the film kept its pace relatively well and it is worth seeing, especially for the tremendous performance of the aforementioned Joaquin Phoenix. He demonstrated, without a doubt, all the professionalism he possesses and how versatile he is.Conclusion & overall: underrated recommended movie. It's worth seeing and enjoying it without taking into account the first footage, because instead of giving you the somber vision that you expected from a story like this, so real and so painfully human, they decorate it with songs that, at least in my opinion, are half left over, if not almost all of them.For more reviews like this one, don't forget to follow.

       "    'Review': \"POSITIVES:1) Phoenix and Gaga both give really great performances, both during the regular scenes and during the musical scenes. I was constantly gripped by what the two of them were doing. The supporting characters such as Harvey Dent and the Arkham guards are also portrayed very well by their respective actors\\n2) The score was one of my favourite parts of the first film and it's one of my favourite parts of this film too. I was very happy that they brought the same composer back to do this film because the score is just as haunting as it was in the first film\\n3) I do think the overall themes of the film are really interesting and could've really worked if the writing had been better. The theme around the dangers of idolising celebrities, and how celebrities are brutally cast aside as soon as they stop living up to the idyllic standards their fans put onto them, was really fascinating I thought. I don't hate the third act of this film as much as a lot of people do because I was able to get on board with this theme more than I think a lot of people will. I also think the idea of basically doing a role reversal on the Joker and Harley characters, where Joker is the one that's head over heels and being manipulated, while Harley is the manipulator who only actually loves herself, is something that could've really worked well in another storyNEGATIVES:1) The musical sequences were completely unnecessary for me and frankly they just weren't that good. They dragged the runtime out and actually took time away from things that I would've preferred to see fleshed out more\\n2) One of the best things about the first film was its vision of Gotham as this disgusting city with some really striking visuals. In this film, basically the entire film takes place either inside Arkham or inside a courtroom, so there aren't really any striking visuals, which seems like such a wasted opportunity for me\\n3) The fundamental main issue with this film without a shadow of a doubt is the writing. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, the film essentially undoes all of the character development that Arthur goes through in the first film and the person he is by the end of this film is essentially identical to the person he is at the start of the first film, which is terrible because everybody knows that the point of storytelling is supposed to be that characters have arcs and go on journeys that change them. Secondly, it's hard to deny the common criticism I'm seeing that basically nothing happens in this film. Arthur's trial takes the entire length of the film to be resolved and yet none of the trial related stuff is even good, apart from the scene with the little person from the first film. The film feels like a lot of disjointed scenes slammed together with pointless musical sequences in between. Finally, whilst it's true what I said before about not hating the third act as much as some do, I still have to admit that the developments seem to come out of nowhere and I think that's inexcusable really. The first two acts are all about Arthur building up to being able to put the Joker persona back on, but then the final act just has him abandon this persona again sooo suddenly without much real justification? Also, like I said earlier, I liked the theme of people turning on their idols once they stop living up to their standards, but having Arthur die from some nobody whose been in the background of a couple scenes and then for that nobody to give himself the iconic Joker scars, implying that he's going to become the Joker we all know, just felt like it was trying to do a really cheap reveal that was supposed to knock fans out but it just didn't land at all. The problem is that you've basically spent the entirety of these two films making the point that this is a different take on the characters and is not trying to be a Batman film, so why did you tease things like that at the end? I actually think an issue with both of these films is that they're trying to tell a different story, and I'm cool with that, but then they undermine themselves with things like having the Waynes get killed to tease Batman, or having Harvey Dent get scarred in the bombing to tease Two Face, or having Arthur die at the end of this film to tease the real Joker.\",\n",

The music choice was great and it wasn't too much or little it was perfect.Todd Phillips should've wrote the Harley's story more we didn't see why she want to be with the joker. The writing didn't gave Gaga an opportunity or justice to deliver a good performance during the film. The idea of she doesn't want to be with the Joker because Arthur doesn't want to be the Joker anymore is brilliant but the delivery was so bad and rushed. That shows that Harley loves the joker not Arthur.The trial scene was great and one of the best in modern cinema and again Joaquin did an outstanding performance.Another thing in the movie is that they don't show us more of the Arthur they only show us little bet of what his mom thinks of him but I felt I wanted more. The movie felt like it doesn't have that core but there is some messages and meanings but it lacked the core.The ending was one of the worst ending ever I have ever seen because the ending was missing a conclusion I mean poor Arthur what he has done to deserve bad writing from Todd like that. At the end watching that ending made me saying that we didn't need a sequel in the first place I give the movie between 6 to 7.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"I have no prior expectation or anticipate any special scene.Arthur Fleck makes a significant statement about how people perceive him. He highlights that others are focused on his past, but he wants to be seen for who he is in the present. This reflects his frustration at being misunderstood or underestimated by society. Arthur's transformation into the Joker stems from this desire to be noticed and acknowledged, as he feels that no one cared about him as Arthur Fleck.He meets a tragic end when he is killed by another patient at Arkham Asylum. The patient carves the iconic Joker smile onto Arthur's face, symbolizing that while Arthur dies, the Joker's ideology lives on. This moment marks the conclusion of Phoenix's portrayal in the series.As for Lady Gaga's character, Harleen Quinzel (Harley Quinn), her journey doesn't end with Arthur's death. While Arthur's story concludes, there is speculation about future spin-offs, potentially focusing on Harley Quinn, which could explore her own narrative and relationships, such as her famous connection with Poison Ivy.\",\n",

I'm ok with how the Joker storyline goes in this version but this movie could have replaced a lot of the random musical daydreams (which added very little to anything) and spent more time on Arthur's mental trauma (which is where Phoenix shines) or on the romance with Harley. Lady Gaga was great but she's so much more than a singer and this movie didn't give her much to show off her acting skills. And other characters in the movie were barely more than props.\",\n",

The narrative unfolds largely in confined settings, heightening the emotional interactions. Despite a substantial budget, the film adopts a minimalist approach, leaving some viewers craving more action and dynamism. While many appreciate the serious and consistent storytelling, the unconventional format may disappoint others.

       "    'Review': 'I loved the first movie. It was beautiful and heartbreaking and interesting. It was unique because it made you feel like the joker felt. It was brand new. And one of its biggest strengths was that the movie didn\\'t tell you what\\'s real and what\\'s not.But in \"Joker Folie à Deux\" they not only made it clear what\\'s real now but they destroyed one of the best parts of the first movie, by, for example, showing what happened to certain characters in the first movie. I thought that was the most disappointing part.Now, I know many people who didn\\'t like the first movie much because they thought it was too emotionally draining. I never thought so, because even though you feel with the Joker and the first part of the movie made me angry and sad, the second part showed him taking back control and winning for once in his life. And that made it bearable for me.In the second movie I found it too much. I could not feel anything but slightly bored sadness through all of this. And even though I like das movies this just felt unnecessary, too real at times (police brutality) and confusing.Confusing because I cautiously liked the first part. Because I still had hope that it was going somewhere. But it honestly didn\\'t.I liked Lady Gaga\\'s acting and singing, I did NOT like her role. Lee didn\\'t quite make sense to me. What was her game? She just felt two dimensional.Something I saw a lot of criticism for, was expectedly the Musical part. I get that some people don\\'t like musicals, I myself do but I was still worried that it would not fit with this film. But I have to say that I actually really liked the sung parts most of the time. Maybe there were a few love songs too many for my tastes but it did make sense all in all and it absolutely fit with the atmosphere. I especially liked that they didn\\'t have Gaga and Phoenix sing well in the \"real\" scenes. It made sense and otherwise I think it would\\'ve been off putting. But then they really shined in the fantasy scenes. I quite enjoyed that.The ending was honestly horrible. I thought that they were going to do to him what they did but not in that way! It made me angry. I can\\'t even really explain why.Now you might think this sounds horrible. You might wonder why, with all that criticism, I still gave this movie 6 stars.Because even for the bad stuff I listed the acting was amazing, the visuals are stunning, I actually enjoyed the movie up to a certain point and even though there\\'s not much happening and I didn\\'t like much of the plot it still made sense.Because I think that this movie has so many one star reviews because these people were fans of the first movie just like me and now they are disappointed because the first film set the expectations too high. If this was a stand-alone it wouldn\\'t have reviews this bad.And I understand that reviews are subjective and people will act out of their emotions but I want to be a bit rational. Of course taste matters in a review but I want to be consistent. I did not hate this movie and I see value in it. That\\'s not a one star in my book.But I will still say that I don\\'t recommend you watch this movie if you liked the first one. It doesn\\'t add anything, it rather subtracts from it.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Todd Phillips\\' \\'Joker: Folie à Deux\\' boldly transforms the gritty realism of the first film into a musical. Set in Arkham Asylum, it delves deeper into Arthur Fleck\\'s psyche, now fully embraced by Joaquin Phoenix\\'s chillingly transformative performance as the Joker and Lady Gaga\\'s debut as Harley Quinn.The film\\'s ambition elevates it but unfortunately leads to its downfall. Joaquin Phoenix\\'s captivating and unsettling performance, coupled with Lady Gaga\\'s vocal prowess, creates a captivating chemistry, especially in the musical numbers. The choice of classic tunes and modern renditions offers a nostalgic yet eerie soundtrack.However, the decision to make this a musical feels misjudged. The integration of songs disrupts the dark, brooding atmosphere of the first film, serving as distractions rather than deepening the narrative. This shift in tone dilutes the original\\'s stark brutality, attempting to broaden its appeal but losing its impact.The story and direction are well-crafted, but the musical elements detract from the overall impact of the film.\"Phillips\\' visually engaging homage to classic musicals struggles with a cohesive narrative. The film\\'s excessive time in Arkham Asylum, while thematic, feels claustrophobic and repetitive. The plot, focusing on Arthur\\'s trial and his budding romance with Harley, lacks the societal critique and rise-to-infamy arc of its predecessor. Instead, it centers on personal madness and love, which is intriguing but doesn\\'t fully satisfy expectations.Criticism centers around Harley Quinn\\'s underdevelopment. Lady Gaga\\'s performance is magnetic, but the script lacks depth and backstory to fully showcase her beyond her musical talents. The film\\'s reluctance to fully embrace either its musical or dramatic elements leaves it in a thematic limbo. The potential for exploring the duo\\'s dynamic is partially realized.\\'Joker: Folie à Deux\\' is a film of contrasts: brilliant in its performances and musical moments, yet disjointed in its narrative and tonal consistency. It\\'s a daring experiment that, while commendable, doesn\\'t fully land. For fans of Phoenix and Gaga, or those intrigued by the unusual marriage of comic book adaptation with musical genre, there\\'s enough to appreciate. However, for those who found the original\\'s dark realism compelling, this sequel might feel like a step into a different, less satisfying universe. A 6 out of 10 reflects this film\\'s ambitious yet flawed attempt at combining the criminal with the carnivalesque.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'I was going to go and see the first Joaquin Phoenix outing as the \"Joker\" (2019) to remind my self of who did what to whom, but I didn\\'t have time. I think I am glad because I recall that being so very much better than this. Here, we pick up after \"Fleck\" (Phoenix) has been on his clown-faced slaughtering spree and is in prison supervised by prison officer \"Jackie\" (Brendan Gleeson). His lawyer \"Maryanne\" (Catherine Keener) is trying to have him declared competent to stand trial for his crimes so she can plead some sort of personality disorder defence - he\\'s not \"Fleck\" when he\\'s the \"Joker\" sort of thing. Thing is, he encounters \"Lee\" (Lady Gaga) at a prison sing-a-long and she manages to ingratiate herself with him and then to derail that plan ensuring the plot twists it\\'s way into the courtroom where his conviction for multiple homicides quickly appears as inevitable as there being a song in the film. Now I did like the soundtrack, but by the way Todd Phillips has presented this, it might as well have been either Tony Bennett or Newley who took on the leading role as her part is largely a series of entertainingly photographed music videos with the thinnest slices of meat constituting a weak story in between. It\\'s a love story, I suppose, but that wasn\\'t really what I turned up to see. There\\'s loads of excess, but no menace or jeopardy and the character\\'s previous adeptness at treading the thin line between sanity and madness isn\\'t really developed at all here. He comes across more as a pathetic, emaciated, prisoner whose flame has well and truly gone out. His legal antagonist (Harry Lawtey) looks about eleven years old but that doesn\\'t really matter either as the judicial proceedings themselves offer us little by way of sustaining drama, even as we build to a denouement that offers the tiniest bit of hope then... It\\'s a stunning piece of cinema, money has been spent and there\\'s imagination a-plenty from the production\\'s designers. It\\'s just too much of a jigsaw of a film with too little plot serving as a vehicle for an album boxed-set that\\'s doubtless ready to hit the shops.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"I knew from the moment I saw the trailer and heard it was a musical that Joker: Folie à Deux wouldn't match the first film. The movie is very slow paced at times and the story is kind of messy and all over the place. Also, like the majority of people, I think the musical aspect of the film was very unnecessary. I don't hate the idea of putting 1 song (2 max) in the film because I do believe that's something Joker would think of in his mind while he's not in touch with reality but it felt like there was a musical number every 5 minutes and it gets old fast. I believe there was 15 songs in the film. Warner Bros. Was scared to market this as a musical so I'm not sure why they took that route to begin with. However, there are great things about this film like the cinematography and the wonderful acting by Joaquin Phoenix, just as we saw in the first movie. Lady Gaga was very good in this as well but I thought her character was underutilized, so much more could've been done there. If you loved the first Joker, you still might like this film. I'm kind of in the middle, I don't dislike it but it's nowhere near the first. It's not one I'd rush out to see right away.\",\n",

This storyline takes place in what DC is calling Elsewheres, their version of Marvel's Multiverse, which means it's not connected to their regular movies. Joaquin is in Arkham Asylum, waiting to go on trial for his murders of 5 people-actually 6, but they only know of the 5. Joaquin meets Gaga in the facility and they fall in love. Brendan plays a guard in Arkham and Catherine is Joaquin's lawyer. If you liked the first movie, you might enjoy traveling deeper into the mind of the psychotic villain that became the main villain of Batman-no, he is not in this movie but there is another villain-before-he-became-a-villain that shows up, Harvey Dent. In case you were wondering, Folie a Deux means Madness of Two, which is symbolic of the relationship between Joaquin & Gaga. There are still plenty of fantasy scenes, but there is also way too much singing. Yep, I'm talking musical singing when they just start singing in the middle of a scene-even though the lyrics seem to fit the scene perfectly. And, I did not care for the ending.It's rated R for violence, language, smoking and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 18 minutes.I love super hero movies but I was a little disappointed in this one. I guess it would be alright to stream.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Todd Phillips, I see you! The intention behind this sequel is so clear, and I believe that it was an organic continuation of the first movie. In my opinion, Arthur was never meant to be idolized, neither from the people in the movie, nor from the general public in the real world. It was not to generate a villain-hero, it was a commentary on social causes, on how society failed Arthur.This sequel remarks the idea that we all got the first movie wrong. It screams: it is not what you think it is, this is not what we should be talking about (semi-cit).Does this sequel add something to the story? No.Does something really happen in the movie? No.Was this movie necessary? Yes.Acting-wise, Joaquin Phoenix is superb! Lady Gaga, despite relatively limited screen time, since scene one is utterly credible in the role of an unhinged and dangerous narcissist.The only problem is: where is the folie à deux? This is probably my biggest critique to the movie. The idea behind the interaction of two main characters is very interesting, but I was left with the sense that it could have been explored more in depth.I wasn't sure about the musical aspect of the whole movie, but overall it makes sense and I believe it works well in setting the scene of complete delusions that the character are in. A few musical numbers felt a bit off tho, either in the placement along the movie, or because completely disconnected from the narrative. Whereas Phoenix's performance of 'The Joker' really is pure art.Overall, an Ok movie, with its highs and lows. Far (but not too far) from the first Joker. But ultimately directed to set the record straight.\",\n",

Its not a bad movie by any means it's just not great or good it's OK I get what they were trying to do the movie isn't about THE joker it's called joker for a reason the movie isn't an origin story it's about Author Fleck and his influence to the real joker I'm assuming but then at that point I'd rather see the origin story of the real joker maybe down the line I will get it and maybe it will be considered a movie ahead of its time but for now I just don't get it I feel like it didn't need to be made especially if they don't do anything with what people are assuming is the real joker at the end like another movie with him or he turns up in a Batman movie years later as the real joker.\",\n",

It's a bit overlong, which honestly did bore me a bit.Overall the movies not really great but it's not as bad as they make it out to be. I've seen much worse movies this past decade. Sure it's not up to par with part 1 and it totally leaves a stain on the amazing first movie, but it still was fun to jump in that little world that Todd Phillips has built.

Never anything that either changes the mood or raises the tension. Joker: Folie à Deux continues as it began, painfully and all the while with human shortcomings as a break in the background. Many say that the movie is not entertaining. It isn\\'t. But I wonder if it has to be entertaining? The purpose of this film must be something else? Something bigger? However, I\\'m having a hard time finding what. The musical elements do not help but me. However, it flows into the film in an unexpectedly good way, which means that it doesn\\'t bother me as much as I usually do. Joker: Folie à Deux is not easy to digest. I stay during the credits and let my thoughts gather. A strong theory, insinuated by director Todd Phillips himself, is that Arthur Fleck is NOT The Joker, i.e. The real Joker. As director Todd himself said - \"Note that the first film is called Joker, not THE Joker\". The theory is that the psychopath who kills Arthur at the end and cuts the corners of his mouth open as a smile (as the real Joker did) is the arch-villain who later becomes Batman\\'s nemesis.',\n",

Even Joaquin's performance and epic background score weren't enough to save this sequel. Lady Gaga is underutilised and is there in the movie just for the songs. Folie à Deux completely diminishes the legacy of Joker. Why make a musical to an epic and ruin the anticipation of fans???Although I would say it's a visual masterpiece, with many scenes that will make long lasting impression especially the one where Phoenix is escorted by prison guards and it starts raining and all guards open their umbrellas which are of different colors and Phoenix is standing in the middle drenching in the rain. These scenes will make you think how great this movie could have been.A huge disappointment for sure!!!\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"It feels like Todd Phillips hates that people really liked the first movie. It's as if he thought that anyone that liked Joker wanted to BE Joker. No Todd, the audience is smarter than that. You made an interesting empathetic character where we learn how a man could commit such evil acts. You feel bad for Arthur but we're not excusing his actions. Yet, some of those that didn't like the first thought you were promoting that behavior. Maybe, don't listen to the people that misunderstood your first movie Todd because it seems like that rhetoric steered your decision making in this sequel.Technically, this movie does a lot right. The acting, score, cinematography, etc. Is all good. Heck, even a couple of the musical numbers are good. The idea of a musical has some potential, while not necessarily a take I'd go, a couple parts show how it could have been very interesting. The movie never commits to it though. So most of the singing feels routine and dull. Ultimately, the writing drags this movie down.Obviously, there was no plan for a direct sequel to Joker, but it was a huge success, therefore WB offers a big paycheck to Todd Phillips to make a sequel. So he creates a movie that no fan of the first movie wanted. Todd gets the last laugh because he's now richer and the punchline is the audience who spent their money to see this movie he knew most wouldn't like. Get it, it's meta, you shouldn't like this stuff, not what you expected, gotcha!\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'In the first movie we saw how society turned a man named Arthur into Joker. For the second part I had anticipated that the we\\'ll see Joker in his full power, scheming and doing mind tricks on people.But to my surprise we come to know that becoming Joker was kind of a one time thing. It just happened, according to the director. Arthur just happened to kill all those people in the first part and has no plans for the future.It seems that the director wanted to portray Joker not as a villain but the victim of an unjust system. It was weird to try feel sorry for a villain.Also the movie is more about the courtroom than anything else. I kept waiting for an awesome ending like the last one, but couldn\\'t find it.There are some funny dark jokes, though. I might have been the only one laughing in the theatre, but I was laughing.At the end of the movie I felt like I had felt after watching Hitler die in Inglorious Basterds, \"Th.. Th..

       "    'Review': \"I just got out of Joker: Folie à DeuxThis isn't a disappointment. It's a bad movie, full stop.Todd Phillips has massively dropped the ball. Everything that was great about the first movie, is missing here. The first movie was meant to be a stand alone movie. But when it made as much as it did. Money talked and it may have talked about making a deadline for the release date, as this is a mess.I don't read or watch reviews before I watch a new movie. But I seen a headline that said Joker Folie à Deux feels like it was bad on purpose. And I get what they mean as it seems Phillips is angry at the fans for making the first movie so successful. He has deliberately gone out of his way to make a movie, they will not even like, let alone love.As what we get is a boringly paced, badly edited, totally unfocused movie, that never gets going, lacks any clear direction (it's all over the place) with a script that needed at least another rewrite.I love a good musical. But the musical sequences in this, stop the movie in it's tracks. They do not belong in this movie. Take them out and you have a better movie. I'd say it's 50/50 songs and dialogue.I think a lot of people, especially people who loved the first movie, are going to hate this. As Phillips totally tears the character of Joker down in a lot of ways.I will say it looks gorgeous with some sticking images and it does have some moments of genius and real standout moments. I think everyone will agree on what the stand out moment of the movie is.Joaquin Phoenix again nails it. Lady GaGa was great too, very charismatic, in a very poorly written role (she doesn't even really become Harley Quinn. She is very unlikeable and downright cruel.I think she has been the victim of some last minute editing, as the ad campaign make this seem like she is co-lead. That is not the case at all. It's a supporting role. A lot of her stuff has been cut from the finished movie. The title doesn't even make sense Folie à Deux translates to a shared delusion. That is not this movie. Arthur and Lee share very little.Brendan Gleason is great too, but when isn't he??They should have turned down the money and kept it at one movie.\",\n",

While I can appreciate the experimentalism in terms of musical numbers and animation, it just isn\\'t all that interesting. I get Joaquin Phoenix / Joker isn\\'t gonna have this wonderfully soothing voice or anything, and the pain in his vocal expression combined with the lyrics is supposed to be the draw, but sad clown warbling just didn\\'t do it for me. Gaga / Harley Quinn is spotlighted too, but it just felt like I was watching and listening to Gaga concert footage. The songs weren\\'t original and the execution was overall underwhelming.Too much of the movie is \"member this???\". It seemed like a meditation and homage to the first Joker more than it did its own thing for about half the film. The camera shots, the lines, all the memorable little \\'moments\\' from the first movie were just rehashed and it made me wish I was watching *that* instead.I could go on, but all else I\\'ll say is, don\\'t get your hopes up too high. Enjoyable enough fare for a night out, but not a must see in theatres. I saw \"Joker\" twice in the same week when it was first released. I doubt I will ever rewatch this one. Oh well.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'Joker: Folie à Deux just had its premiere, and I have never seen so many people at an opening night. The line stretched all the way outside. Expectations were sky-high, to say the least! But how did people leave the theater? Many walked out feeling confused, and that\\'s understandable. The movie does something no one has ever seen before, and people certainly weren\\'t ready for it.At first, I was ready to harshly criticize it. But the more I thought about it, the more conflicted I became. There are two ways to interpret this movie/musical. One interpretation is that it failed. Failed to entertain the audience, failed to deliver what people wanted-especially for those expecting something similar to the first film. That\\'s because Joker: Folie à Deux chooses the musical format to convey its message. Now, that\\'s not inherently a bad thing. We\\'ve seen musicals that have done the exact opposite, like La La Land or Chicago. But here, even though the musical element is a core part of the movie, with Lady Gaga\\'s inclusion promising a spectacular show, it falls short of delivering on that promise.Gaga sings flawlessly, but it\\'s not the Gaga we know. It\\'s as if her larger-than-life persona has vanished. Meanwhile, most of the songs feel flat, not taking you anywhere, making you experience them as pauses in the story rather than moments of progression. Unfortunately, the story itself feels repetitive at times and doesn\\'t quite hook you in. Additionally, the chemistry between Joker and Harley Quinn is not what you\\'d expect-it\\'s weak. If the film had 3-4 fewer musical numbers (since some were genuinely worth keeping), we might be having a very different conversation. There are individual moments in the film that are brilliant, but they fail to connect with the rest, losing their impact within a broader, somewhat unpleasant whole.At one point, Joker says to Harley, \"Stop singing,\" and I think the entire theater collectively agreed with him. But that\\'s where the second interpretation of this movie comes in. With that line, it\\'s as if Todd Phillips is winking at the audience, telling us, \"I know you\\'re not having fun. I feel you. I\\'m not clueless; I know what I\\'m doing.\" And what he\\'s doing is as bold as it is necessary. He\\'s creating a new reference point in art. He sacrifices the mainstream success of his film to make a statement and leave behind something that we might never see again.Think about it-when will you ever see one of DC\\'s darkest villains, the Joker, in a musical again, and not in some indie production but in a blockbuster? In short, Joker: Folie à Deux may fail as a blockbuster, as a film for everyone, as basic entertainment, but it succeeds in shaking up pop culture. It might very well go down in history as a bold, audacious piece of art that inspires future creators to break the norms.Now that this movie exists, others can attempt to blend the most unlikely genres, hoping to create something extraordinary, a new hybrid. Joker: Folie à Deux certainly wasn\\'t that, though. But the start has to come from somewhere. So, I rate it a 6/10 as a viewer because it could have been much better, even in the format it chose, but as an art lover, I tip my hat to it for what it may inspire in the future.As for the ending, which many didn\\'t like at all, for me, it was the entire movie :)',\n",

But when you decide to make it all about analizing and deconstructing the first movie and commenting on how people reacted to it, that's a very bold move, definitely worthy of my respect.I love the idea for this movie, honestly, and it really has some delighting moments, but unfortunately in the end it's impossible to miss the fact that we're watching a Todd Phillips' film. This guy is just not capable of writing a really good, well-balanced and complicated script. Musical scenes, even though they're beatifully sang, feel very much out of nowhere and unnecessary. The whole court trial is a bad joke. And there are also a few plot wholes, of course.Phoenix is great again, maybe even better than before, but his role is much less flashy, so people will appreciate it less. Gaga is also doing a great job, but she has much less to do, that she should. The whole movie obviously looks really good and the technical side does the job.In the end, it's much more original and treats mental problems more seriously, but it's still a bit worse than the first movie. It's not a truly good film, while it could have been great.\",\n",

It is not crazy, it's not madness, it's just odd drama.

I'm not a fan of musicals but I thought that using that to give the audience a sense of Arthur Fleck's confused state of mind fit. And it did work - to a point. However it was overdone to the point where it overshadowed the overall story. It reached the point where the continued musical numbers became tedious and boring. By the time the film reached it's conclusion I was no longer riveted like I had been earlier. I was pretty much bored and waiting for it to be done with.Story-wise, I felt that everything about it made sense. I just got the sense that the story wasn't told well.

       "    'Review': \"Joaquin Phoenix's performance in The Joker: Folie à Deux is nothing short of extraordinary. And it's the only thing that saves this movie from having a worst rating, in my opinion. His ability to convey the depths of Arthur Fleck's mental anguish is both haunting and mesmerizing. Phoenix's dedication to the role is evident in every scene, and his performance is a testament to his incredible talent and range as an actor.However, despite Phoenix's stellar performance, the film's forced and unsatisfying ending leaves a sour taste in the mouth. I couldn't shake the feeling that the ending was completely forced.The film concludes with a surprising twist: Arthur is murdered in prison by a fellow inmate who idolizes the Joker. This inmate proceeds to disfigure Arthur's face, mirroring the iconic scars of Heath Ledger's Joker from The Dark Knight. It's a shocking turn of events, but it also feels contrived.Given Joaquin Phoenix's public statements about his desire to move on from the role, I can't help but wonder if this ending was added to the script as a way to continue the Joker's story without his involvement. It seems like the filmmakers were forced to come up with a way to keep the franchise going, and this abrupt twist was the result.While the film offers compelling performances and stunning visuals, the forced and somewhat unsatisfying conclusion leaves a lot to be desired. It's a shame that such a promising film was marred by a twist that felt more like a plot device than a genuine narrative choice.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Co-writer and director Todd Phillips\\' follow-up to his 2019 hit presents the next logical step for Joaquin Phoenix\\'s Arthur Fleck: he\\'s been incarcerated for his crimes (five murders) at a rough Department of Corrections and is preparing to stand trial. There\\'s no escape plan, no one is plotting to break Arthur out, and so DC Comics fans might be disappointed in Phillips\\' approach. There are problems: Fleck\\'s mental competency is tested before his trial begins and it\\'s an early dud scene; Arthur is so dreamily disconnected that the sequence doesn\\'t come to mean much--he\\'s declared fit to go to trial (incredibly) and we don\\'t even see a flash of Joker. Arthur meets a young woman in the next ward who seems just as dazed as he does and they form a bond, but Arthur\\'s lawyer tells him the truth about this girl, Harley Quinn: she\\'s not a convicted arsonist as she claims, she\\'s from a wealthy family (still living) and checked herself into Arkham State Hospital voluntarily. Phoenix has his first terrific scene quietly confronting \"Lee\" (Lady Gaga) over her intentions, but after some blithe answers she breaks into song. This is an example of what DC Comics fans won\\'t like: the substitution of drama--and character content--with singing (usually classic pop songs, like The Carpenters\\' \"Close to You\", or showtunes). Quinn never quite emerges here as a fully-developed character, even though Gaga is good and her early scenes are promising. The song numbers are used as a fantasy release--and we need that--but they don\\'t move us or amuse us while Phillips\\' plot is spinning around in a circle. Fleck\\'s trial (televised, with the world watching) isolates the movie. The prison scenes have action and movement, but the courtroom set is pretty dull. When Fleck fires his attorney (Catherine Keener) and represents himself as Joker, there\\'s a burst of excitement--but what happens? He cross-examines one witness, Mr. Puddles (Leigh Gill) and he rests his case. Phillips is saving his big surprise for the third act and, while it isn\\'t the firecracker we\\'re hoping for, at least it takes viewers outside where we can breathe. \"Joker\" has fine performances, it is structurally sound and takes place on \"real\" ground, but it has only snippets of pizzazz. **1/2 from ****',\n",

Unbelievably, I even saw some people fall asleep during the film! The pacing dragged, and it lacked the intense energy that kept the original Joker engaging from start to finish.On the positive side, the cinematography was beautiful, and Joaquin Phoenix is still excellent as Arthur Fleck. The acting was there, no doubt about that. But even with these strong elements, something was off. The film felt overly long, and by the end, it just seemed to lose direction.In the end, Joker: Folie à Deux had its moments, but the musical direction and uneven pacing left me feeling underwhelmed.',\n",

       "    'Review': ':🎬 Just watched \"The Joker 2\" and I have to say, Joaquin Phoenix\\'s performance as the iconic character was truly mesmerizing! 🃏🌟 Despite a few slow moments, his portrayal kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the film. Plus, Lady Gaga\\'s take on Harley Quinn added an exciting twist to the storyline! Overall, a solid 6.5/7 out of 10 rating from me! Can\\'t wait to see what\\'s next for these characters! . Harely character needed more development and I think if they had developed it more we would had a better movie. The songs gave it a nice twist as well. I also wish more dc characters were used in the movie it might have given it more depth .',\n",

       "    'Review': 'I loved the first Joker. Probably my favorite movie in recent years. This movie was a disgrace to the first. Todd saw an oscar and immediately went on the cash grab. There was no depth to this plot deeper than \\'Arthur is a little b**** and he could never be the joker\\'.Who asked for you to turn the first movie into a lie? Joker (the movie) is mentioned as a real movie in the world of the second film, a \\'TV movie\\'. So why would we trust anything the first movie showed us about Arthur\\'s character? We can\\'t. Nothing in it is real. In this movie Arthur\\'s character is completely different. He is turned into a fraud and someone so in their own head they think they committed crimes they never did. Harley takes advantage of this, pushing his Joker persona. The second Arthur realizes how delusional he is she leaves him and creates another \\'real\\' Joker to go kill Arthur, someone who\\'s an actual psychopath (omg so Joker coded right).Todd Philips seems to have some idea that despite completely going off the rails from the comics his characters should still be comically accurate. I think he saw Arthur as too much of a beta. (not even joking with that wording, Todd said Arthur would look up to batman if they met because batman is so much of an \"alpha male\"). Nobody wanted a run-around turned into crappy prequel for the Dark Knight. It isn\\'t fun, it isn\\'t interesting, it wasn\\'t shocking. It was very disappointing and it ruined the first movie. There\\'s no guessing which scenes are real or fake anymore, it is painfully obvious in both movies after watching the second. No more fun allowed.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'I have just seen the film in the movies and all i watched was about Arthur trying to both take control of himself and go deeply inside him. There was no Harley Quinn in the film. I find the performance of Phoenix as masterpiece to both the joker and Arthur but there is basically no such a big comparison to the first movie. The way the film has been shot, is stunning, which leads it to the fact that the subgoal of the joker has been buried behind the musical aspects. Ultimately my opinion on the second sequel to the first one is such a disappointment that cannot expressed appropriately. I would like you all to share your revies on this to me.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"This movie had the potential to be a great follow-up to its predecessor, but unfortunately, it falls short in several areas. While Joaquin Phoenix once again delivers an outstanding performance, elevating every scene he's in, the rest of the film doesn't live up to the same standard. His portrayal of Arthur Fleck remains deeply compelling, and if it weren't for his commitment to the role, the film would have been much harder to sit through.The story, however, felt disjointed and left far too many questions unanswered. It seemed as though much of the narrative either stalled or was confined to the courtroom, creating a repetitive structure that lacked forward momentum. We barely learned anything new about the characters or their motivations, particularly Lee. There was so much potential to explore her backstory, but instead, her character felt one-dimensional, like she was just upset over a bad breakup, which felt underwhelming and incomplete.Lady Gaga's performance lacked the depth and emotional intensity that the role demanded, making her character feel flat and uninspiring. Given the complex, chaotic nature of the Joker's world, this lack of dynamism felt like a major missed opportunity.Overall, this movie could have been great. With Joaquin Phoenix's talent and the rich potential of the Joker character, there was a real chance to dive deep into compelling, gritty storytelling. Instead, the movie opted for a repetitive plot and underdeveloped characters, making it fall short of its potential.\",\n",

       "   {'Review Summary': \"Phillips; A Director Who Doesn't Care For The Devoted Audience\",\n",
       "    'Review': \"Todd Phillips is a masterclass director, directing some of the highest grossing films of all times like The Hangover. Joker (2019) was no exception to this, being the highest grossing restricted movie of all time at time of release. I was lucky enough to snag two tickets to a premiere in my area for Joker: Folie a Deux, and I left the theatre more disappointed than I anticipated. All of the ingredients were there to make a good recipe, and somehow, this movie came out of the oven tasteful but insanely dry.The film follows Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) after the events of Joker (2019). He now has a devoted fanbase outside of his imprisonment at Arkham Asylum, and has even made friends with fellow guards and prisoners. Upon being upgraded to a minimum watch zone within the penitentiary, he meets Lee Quinzel (Lady Gaga), a superfan who has devoted her life to following Arthur's mentality. Together, they devise a plan to get them both out of jail where they can eventually live a happy life together, but at the cost of putting the Gotham in danger.Heres what the movie does right: the direction and cinematography. Being a direction nerd, I was so taken aback by the beauty of some of the shots in this film. Please see this on the biggest screen you can. I saw it in an IMAX theatre and it was so beautiful to behold. Phillips knows exactly what he's doing with these shots and what they are adding to the story. Also, the performances. Gaga, as always, never fails to surprise me with her acting abilities. Phoenix, reprising his oscar-winning role, hasn't lost sight of the character at all, and once again wowed me, a similar, slightly less scared, feeling as when i left the theatre to Joker (2019). The production and scenic design were also great as always, but we knew that going in. Especially knowing that this is indeed a musical, they really went for it.Heres what I perhaps didn't like as much: 2 main factors. The musicality, and the script. I love a good musical; some of my favourite movies are musicals. In this movie, the music felt so forced and not needed. I got exactly what they were trying to do with the numbers, and some worked (If my friends could see me now, Oh when the saints). But a lot of them just felt like filler in a rather empty movie. Which brings it into the next major point, the script. This movie has no clue what it wants to be. Its mostly a courtroom drama that has an outcome anyone could see coming, and also jumps the shark with less than 10 minutes left in the runtime. Phillips doesn't trust the audience to have either seen the first one, nor follow any DC lore. Lee Quinzel, obviously an anagram for another very famous DC villain, feels completely underwritten in this movie. We have zero clue who she is and when we see her character for the final time, you still don't really have a clue who she is. Harvey Kent plays a pretty main role in this film, and anyone knowing batman knows exactly who Harvey Kent is, who he becomes, and what his intentions are. It wasn't shocking. Nothing surprised me with this movie, which is so sad because the first one left my spine tingling. That was the most unfortunate part once the credits started to roll.Overall, this movie is indeed watchable, but after coming off of such a high from the first movie, it leaves a sour taste in your mouth. It's not bad by any means, in fact, I enjoyed it more than I didn't. But I really dont think this movie got to the apex it needed to, but it got 70% there. I predict it will get big but not the levels of Joker (2019)\",\n",

This film is a musical, which gives it a cool twist, even if it's a bit dark. Some folks might say it's less dark than the first one, and I can see why. The first part really built up the Joker's character, but this time, it focuses more on Lady Gaga's character and how she connects with him.This phase is super important for the Joker because it shows how he'll become more wild. By the end, you get a hint of how he'll really let loose in the next movie. The film talks about serious stuff like mental health and how people treat each other, and it does it well. Plus, the music and the way the city looks are really impressive.I didn't see any big problems with the movie. It's strong and makes you think.

       "    'Review': \"Rating: 6.6\\nOverall, a clear cash grab as this movie does not provide anything new or interesting to the universe and ruins the unique, open-ended brilliance of 'Joker'; but it is a decent watch for its cinematography, visuals, technicals, and acting.Direction: Pretty Good\\nThe direction on a macroscale is great as he uses cinematography and imagery to really paint the screen and build the world; the direction on a microscale is not that strong as it feels like it is kind of rehashing what they did in the last film, and the interpersonal scenes between Phoenix and Gaga were not that amazing; the storytelling is a lot less innovative as last time as they really don't subvert your expectations because the movie just goes through the progressions; the use of music and musical numbers to help tell the story was not that strong as it really only hurt the movie by moving away from what was going on; they build tension well as they still use score and cinematography to help with this, but it feels like this is just using experience from the last filmStory: Bad\\nThe concept is not that great; it is not that original, and really just feels like a cash grab; the movie does not really provide anything new to these characters and just shows why there should not have been a sequel; the idea of having this be a jukebox musical really kinda backfired in the end because it did not feel like it was executed well and took away from the charm of the first movie; the plot structure is way more linear this time around and pretty predictable, with the interjections in musical numbers being the only thing that deviates from the linear structure; the character writing is not that great this time around as it does not provide any additional depth to Arthur Fleck; it honestly makes his character worse as they took away a lot from what made the character interesting in the first film, and Lee really just feels like an uninteresting interpretation of Harley Quinn; this story really hurts the first movie as the predecessor no longer has an open-for-interpretation endingScreenplay: Pretty Good\\nThe dialogue is alright for the most part, but has a lot of corny and cringey lines that really stand out and make the movie feel pretentious; the humor is not as strong this time around, but does have some noteworthy moments; there are so many illusions and homages in this movie as the movie references like 'Singing in the Rain' and 'Psycho' while also referencing important historical trials like Ted Bundy and Billy Milligan, but it does so in a little too overt manner at times; the symbolism is not as strong as the previous movie as there really isn't anything to take away from this movie; the foreshadowing is not as strong as the first movie as they really plant seeds that never come out, kinda subverting our expectations by being predictable this time aroundActing: Good\\nJoaquin Phoenix: Good to Very Good (Uses a lot of his experience from playing to role to help define this character and feels like he never left in the more dramatic scenes, but does not really hold his own well in the musical numbers; does not have the best chemistry with Lady Gaga; does not feel like he was given as much runway to work with this time around)\\nLady Gaga: Good (Does very well in the music numbers and holds her own well; is not really given that much material to really show off and stand alone outside of Phoenix's performance; does not have the best chemistry with Phoenix)\\nBrendan Gleeson: Good (Has a surprisingly charismatic performance and has good chemistry with Phoenix)\\nCatherine Keener: Pretty Good to Good (Plays her role well and has good chemistry with Phoenix)\\nZazie Beetz: Pretty Good (Really just a cameo)\\nRest of the cast: Pretty Good (Supports the main cast well and shows the different faces of Gotham)Score: Very Good\\nStill has a lot of the same themes as the first movie and is still used to create tension, it is just used way less than the first movieSoundtrack: Decent\\nThe song selection was pretty good; it is just the musical numbers were pretty hit or miss; I enjoyed the grand dance sequence numbers that felt like non-sequiturs, but felt like the singing in the middle of scenes really took away from the filmCinematography: Incredible\\nThe best part of the movie, as I felt, was the cinematography; it really painted the screen with stunning visuals and was effectively used to display imagery to make this movie feel like an art piece; Some of my favorite shots were the 'Singing in the Rain' reference, the pills making a smile, the smile with the lipstick on the glass, and the courtroom scene where Arthur is out of focus but you see his face looking at the audience from the video-camera screen; The use of IMAX shots was done well as this was mostly used to show grand sequences, inside Arthur's mind, or the musical numbers; The color grading was really nice in helping show the dark, colorless side of GothamEditing: Great\\nUsed very well in conjunction with the cinematography to make this movie visually appealing and an art pieceSound: Very Good\\nUsed well to build tension and show some of the action sequences; the constant laughing and distant sounds in the background really helped us feel like we are inside Arthur's mind as he constantly hears thoughtsVisual Effects: Good\\nHelped paint the world of Gotham; the pyrotechnics and practice effects felt fine, but not that surprisingProduction Design: Very Good\\nReally enjoyed how they created Gotham (basically New York City) and Arkham Asylum; really enjoyed some of the sets for the musical scenes as they felt like they paid homage to the 50s and 60s; the production design as a whole did not feel as amazing/iconic as the last movieMakeup: Very Good\\nHelped paint and create the Joker and Harley QuinnCostumes: Very Good\\nHelped paint and create the Joker and Harley QuinnPacing\\nPacing was good for the most part, as the movie felt like it was getting through a lot of plot in such a short runtime; the climax could have been cut a littleClimax\\nThe climax was poorly executed, as it felt like it did not end the movie well, as it felt like nothing interesting happened; the sequel was definitely more straightforward and not as iconic or innovative as the first movieTone\\nTone is not good as it tries to be a musical while simultaneously trying to be an auteur-driven psychological thriller; the former really hurts the intentions of the latter as it does neither very wellFinal Notes\\nI really felt like this movie wasn't necessary going into the movie and I feel this way even more after watching the movie; this movie just feels like a cash grab as it does not provide anything new or interesting to the universe; the idea of having a sequel really hurts the open-ended nature of the first movie and kinda makes it worse in retrospect.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker 2 attempts to once again dive into the mind of Arthur Fleck, but unfortunately, it treads too much of the same ground as the first film. The original Joker was such a meticulous and thorough character study that by the end, it felt like there was little left to uncover. That exact feeling haunts this sequel, as it struggles to find new dimensions to Arthur's complex psyche, leaving the film feeling more like an epilogue rather than a fresh narrative.Joaquin Phoenix, as expected, delivers an excellent performance as Arthur Fleck, further cementing his unsettling portrayal of the Joker. Lady Gaga also brings depth to her role as Harley Quinn, adding a new dynamic to Arthur's story. However, the movie continuously pulls away from their strong performances with unnecessary musical numbers and courtroom drama that feel out of place.Ironically, the movie feels its best when it alludes to the iconic scenes and atmosphere of the first film, rather than when it tries to experiment with new elements. The callbacks to Arthur's lonely and disturbed journey in the original film evoke the same eerie tension and emotional weight that made Joker so powerful. However, the attempts to add new layers with the courtroom drama and out-of-nowhere musical sequences ultimately detract from the story's flow, feeling more like distractions than meaningful additions.The film shines brightest when it focuses on the twisted and toxic relationship between Joker and Harley. The chemistry between Phoenix and Gaga adds a fascinating layer to the film, but unfortunately, these moments are too few and far between.Ultimately, Joker 2 feels more like a continuation that didn't have much more to say. While it has its highlights, particularly in its performances, the film feels like an unnecessary add-on to the first rather than a compelling new chapter. For fans of the original, it might feel redundant, offering little new exploration of Arthur's character or the world he inhabits.\",\n",

Those who paid to see it shelled out $17. I would NOT recommend spending that much money. Also, I can't think of anything that happened on screen that justifies IMAX.I appreciated how they incorporated the musical elements. I wouldn't call it a musical in the Broadway sense, although there were some nods to that. The songs did reflect the emotions of the characters and weren't just plopped in to do musical numbers.The story does pick up from the first movie. In fact, several of the questions about the first movie were answered satisfactorily (at least to me). Unfortunately, I think this diminished the mystique (at least to me) of Joker himself. I did not care about him, or his journey, as much as I did in the first movie.I've got to say, though, that this ain't your Hollywood ending. Something is thrown in in the last scene that dropped my jaw.This isn't a movie you go to to be entertained. It provokes thought and discussion. At this screening, a group in the first row turned around and asked the rest of the audience what we thought. I put my head down and walked out because I wasn't sure what I thought. I'm still trying to figure it out. That makes it a movie worth seeing but not for full price.\",\n",

The director goes on to make a sequel that is unfortunately empty and has no character development.Phillips outdone himself in directing a film that has an outstanding cinematography/visuals that portrays every feeling and emotion that it wants to tell and express. BUT, he failed in creating an engaging storyline. From a part one to a part two, usually the characters of the film change. Their arc either declines or inclines. Their personalities change. Events/obstacles come along their way to shift their lives. OR new character/s enter their life which opens the door for more interesting events to come along their way resulting in a \"Folie à Deux\". In this film, Joker\\'s/Arthur Fleck\\'s life doesn\\'t seem to change much as Gaga\\'s character, Lee, is added. Instead, the film keeps repeating its events by REvisiting the past (the first Joker film) or reacting some of its scenes. It also keeps coming back and forth to the same locations and events within this film itself. Resulting in an overall dull film that is ONLY visually entertaining.This film introduces two major characters within the Gotham world, Harvey Dent, who is played terribly by Harry Lawtey and written even worse. By the end of the film, I felt like he was useless and is taken advantage of because of his \\'name\\' within the comic books fandom. Same goes to Lady Gaga\\'s Lee that simply felt like it wasn\\'t even in this film.I enjoyed how this film uses music/songs to showcase that it\\'s an ESCAPE for our inner selves. But, the song choices weren\\'t on point. On the other hand, their performance was well done by Gaga or Joaquin Phoenix and Lawrence Sher\\'s cinematography skills.',\n",

It's about the madness he inspires, a sad man's act and mistake.Watch it openly, understand that it is not a musical, but deluded couple, don't delude yourself out of seeing a very good movie.This film took Arthur Fleck as far as he could go, and gives him meaning and purpose, it is not an insult or joke.If you think so, the joke is on you.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Right off the bat - it's not the *best* movie but it really does close the chapter to Arthur's storyline. May not have been a great idea to make it a 1/3 musical (because it really is not a musical throughout the entire film), but it really adds some perspective to his psyche. Because all musical sequences were when he closed himself off from the outside world.Ultimately I enjoyed the movie and feel it could have had a bit more chaos and chemistry between Harley and joker, but it is what is. Harleys character is just useless in this plot and even she wasn't in it it wouldn't have made much of a difference. Still the troubled mind of Arthur is what keeps this afloat and the idea of the joker that spreads across Arkham.Overall - a watch for me, would watch it again sometime in the future.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"The film can be put into two parts, the good and the bad, first half being the bad part and second part being pretty damn great.The first hour is very slow and confusing, not much energy put into it and you start becoming very confused about who this was made for and what kind of drugs certain people involved were on. The singing felt very out of place at first and was not that impressive. I think the biggest problem by far was that the first part was terribly edited, I legit do believe you can make a pretty great film out of this mess if you made certain scenes longer and completely changed the cuts. Hopefully deleted scenes will be released, maybe there's something out of value that was left out. Hell maybe I should edit it myself. If the film studio is reading this, I'm your guy. Pull the film from theaters, let me work on it and then it will become the big hit it was meant to be.I only watched the first 40 minutes and then took a break for a couple of days and finished the movie now. I can't remember if I was high or drunk when watching the first 40 minutes but it didn't make it better.Anyway almost directly after you reach the 1 hour mark things starts getting intresting, the film got some life and energy to it. Scenes went from being very boring and confusing to being fun and meaningful. Some mismatches were still made but overall there was a lot more to like then dislike and even the second half can become a lot greater with editing.The Singing, akward dialoge, The very weird narrative will not make any sense for normies, It's too deep for them to ever be able to understand the genius behind it. The film choses to show Arthur's broken mind not in third person, but within the filmmaking itself. It's pure representation of trauma and extreme mental problems. That's why normies can't understand any of it, because they do not understand at all the mind of a person like Arthur, This film boldly goes way deeper then the first film, who had only scratched the surface.The last 15 minutes was dissapointing but amazing at the same time.\",\n",

Filmmaker Todd Phillips' ambitious sequel to his hit reimagining of the DC arch villain is largely hit/miss in spite of Phoenix reprising his Oscar-winning role as Arthur Fleck whose imprisonment for several murders in the aftermath of the original has him set for his day in court while romancing fellow screw-loose fangirl Lee Quinzel (aka Harley Quinn - played with a determined Gaga). While its an interesting choice to have musical numbers (largely fantasy based within the characters' minds) and the gusto of its leads the film is an event in patience limits for its core audience particularly in its final act. Filmed in IMAX smartly using its practical f/x & locales (largely shot in my home state of NJ; YW) the cinematography by Lawrence Sher and Hilduer Guonadottir's sturm and drang score are well produced for its initial environs thru out.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Folie à Deux is not so much a double madness as it is a madness reversal.The success of the first Joker lies in the fact that its dark representations and interpretations profoundly elicit the dark side of the public's heart. When people see their dark side, fear and have to face it. The Joker is the best point of expression, even its dark influence far beyond the director and the main actor's expression. Then the subsequent fear has to be saved and glorified by the director and production attempts.Although it is said to be a double madness, it is actually the first step after the Joker's madness controls Arthur, the director wants the second madness to be Arthur controlling the Joker back. But the director and production underestimated the reality of the darkness. This attempt to return to social normality was not accepted.Or the viewers who came to watch Joker 2 to challenge their values by making it even darker were forced to go back and watch the reversal. It's madness on the part of the director, but it wasn't accepted.What I saw was the director and producer's fear and redemption of the impact and deep darkness of the first movie.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Originally having no interest in the film, but getting curious due to the overwhelmingly negative reviews, I decided to watch Folie à Deux today to see what went so wrong. But ultimately, I don't think it's nearly as bad as people are making it out to be and I honestly thoroughly enjoyed it. However, it most definitely has multiple flawsNow, this movie is ultimately a courthouse drama, with basically only 2 locations during it's entire runtime. However, I personally found the story interesting and engaging enough to keep watching and not get bored. There are a few very questionable moments in the script though.The movie itself looks gorgeous. The cinematography and the directing was amazing and there isn't a single even remotely bad looking shot in this film. The acting from Phoenix is as outstanding as expected and Gaga also did quite well in my opinion.But where the movie fails, is that it's more of an epilogue than a sequel. There's not much new it puts on the table. Even Harley Queen seemed like an unnecessary addition that ultimately didn't matter. The whole movie is basically just talking about the events of the last one. There are some moments where it tries to show the consequences of the last film's actions (and I did like what they did do with that), but this aspect also seemed to be overshadowed by just recapping things that we already did see happen previously.The musical aspect of the movie is definitely something people are torn about, but I find myself in the middle of the pack. Sometimes the singing worked quite well in the context and the movie did have some fantasticly directed musical segments. But other times, this aspect felt too forced and just took you out of the mood. I also think they could've been built into the movie better. Instead of them being just day dreaming sequences, they should've tied them into regular scenes, like a normal musical would.People really seem to hate the ending, and I honestly don't get why. I thought it was (for the most part) a quite powerful, fitting and tragic end to the character. But it wasn't anything revolutionary or anything that would keep me thinking for more than an hour after the movie.In conclusion, there is a lot of flaws with this film and it could've been so much better. But I do feel like it's very overhated and I found myself engaged and interested in what was happening in the film. Despite the cons, I still liked the movie, but it is quite forgetable.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"As Arthur Fleck awaits assessment over whether he is fit to stand trial, he encounters Lee Quinzel through music therapy, and a spiritual connection is made: she is just as damaged as he is. Arthur's trial proceeds and Lee is there to offer him encouragement.First things first: despite the odd trimmings (Arkham, Harvey Dent), this film and its predecessor have nothing to do with Batman, the DC universe, or the Joker from the comics. Arthur Fleck is just a disadvantaged, damaged, disturbed soul, very much to be pitied albeit his crimes are unforgiveable.I thoroughly disliked the first film. Having set Fleck up as a sympathetic victim, it then concluded in a dispiriting air of celebrating nihilistic notoriety. I thought its message was repellent, and Joaquin's performance was an obvious one, full of freak-of-the-week tics and mannerisms. I expected more of the same, especially since the things I hated seemed to be the reasons why it was successful.I really liked this one. Phoenix gives a nuanced performance of a man who, ultimately, grasps the difference between right and wrong and struggles with the Joker and Fleck dichotomy within him as well as his new connection with Quinzel. I found this film much more dramatically satisfying (the end, annoyingly spoilers in a newspaper article, seemed a bit tacked on and unnecessary).Yes, it's a musical. It didn't need to be, it's not a typical musical, but I quite enjoyed it although a little of Phoenix' singing voice goes a long film. I thought it was an imaginative and rather brave way to follow up the success of the first film.Oh, and the film needs to make up its mind whether it's set in New York or Gotham City.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Have you ever danced alone in a room, guided by music coming exclusively from your head, or read a book that broadened your horizons, disturbed your previous convictions, forced you to change? Have you ever looked into someone\\'s eyes so deeply, felt someone else\\'s soul and the infinity of existence in those pupils? Have you been consumed? If your answer is no, it\\'s obvious why this movie is not for you. Mediocre thinking has led you to the conclusion that a villain must have a hero to fight against. This movie is NOT about \"good\" and \"bad\" guys and how a superhero will defeat a sick psychopath. The fight is solely within ourselves, us against the shadow that we were and that we can become. What is the biggest driver for fighting with ourselves, with the anxieties that the world burdens us with, where to find the right motive valuable enough so that every time we \"wipe the floor\" , we get up again ready for another round. Money, fame, recognition, beauty, power? The answer is precisely in every aspect, the words and songs of our \"hero\" Arthur Fleck and Harley. That\\'s love. And what is the closest way to feel the storm of euphoria when you are next to someone you love, than through a musical symphony. Tracks such as \"Get Happy\", \"To Love Somebody\", \"Gonna Build A Mountain\" and of course \"That\\'s Life\" performed by Lady Gaga perfectly approximated the \"crazy romance\" and constant Arthur Fleck\\'s fight with his, I believe, alter ego in the form of the Joker. The fact that we were watching an ordinary man, no super villain, is confirmed by his reaction when he was finally able to embrace his role as the Joker. He felt power, support, belonging, and despite everything, he finally became interesting and funny to someone, but he chose none of that, but to heal the absence of love that he never really had. Which shows us another reason why people didn\\'t like this movie. They expected a crazy killer who stomps people with his club and gets a prelude to his villainous era, while they got a vulnerable, unstable and in love man, who would like to take off the mask and be who he is, and that is hurt. Of course, the broad dullness of the masses through social networks made it impossible to give a chance to anything that does not immediately and constantly hold their attention, alienation from emotion, listening to superficial and generic music and finally the inability to understand any artistic metaphor led to the fact that the film it turns out to be a \"flop\".To conclude, the film is solid, interesting with minor problems with \"pacing\". It has strong emotion, satisfying acting and a perfect ending. The \"failed\" fate of this film reinforced the whole point of the film, which is that people don\\'t understand madness or any more abstract emotion and condemn anything that is different from what is widely represented and trendy. Joker \"Folie a Deux\" gave everyone the opportunity to step out of their comfort zone, some did it, while some, unfortunately, remained cocooned.',\n",

       "    'Review': '\"Joker: Foliè a Deux\" is a film whose objective must be understood. This second chapter dedicated to Arthur Fleck is not at all on the level of the first (which for me is a masterpiece) but it\\'s not even that big crap everyone talks about. I think the film revolves around the initial animated scene, where you understand that the film will deal with the inner conflict between Arthur and his Joker, which you understand he wants to get rid of. In this movie you see Arthur at the Arkham State Hospital that one day knows Lee, the so-called \"Harley Quinn\", who everyone calls \"not faithful to comics\"...now, I do not like reading and I have never read a marvel/dc comic, but even the first Joker was faithful to what I heard. Sometimes to do something memorable you have to go out of the box, there were many Jokers all alike, this Joker instead is remembered for its originality, its history. You can\\'t always think that if you don\\'t see what you want to see the movie sucks. You have to understand what the film\\'s intentions are and the message it wants to convey. In this case the message that the film wants to convey to the viewer is that Joker is simply a normal person who has been transformed by those around him and that you must never accept being who you are not really just to get fame or pleasure from others. This is what Arthur understood during this film. The ultra positive things about the film are Joaquin Phoenix, the direction of Philips, the script and the fabulous photography. Lady Gaga was also good, managing to give a nice voice to the songs, but they are really boring and of bad taste, quite repetitive and sometimes, I repeat, really boring and constant. The film is a musical, but what makes a musical good are the songs... well, here it\\'s the opposite. The songs are the worst aspect of the film. Another problem of the film is as already mentioned the rhythm, the movie is at times really boring and tiring, some parts had to be reduced. For example, in my opinion the part of the trial and interrogations should have been reduced, it could have been resolved earlier, but I can accept this. One thing I would have liked is the pure \"Foliè\" of Joker and Harley, which has never been there. In my opinion it would have removed a lot of static from the film, making it more enjoyable. The final part of the film is moving. I think Arthur\\'s death is a waste, such a well-built and played character they should use more. Especially because the prisoner who killed Joker has not been investigated...even if I think about it, it\\'s fine because it is simply a sequence, as mentioned in the last song of the film. It all happened because Arthur refused to be the Joker and rejected him. I can\\'t wait to see this film again to understand it better and to understand even more the real elegance and motive of Todd Philips\\' film..\\nRating: 7/10.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie à Deux is a film with slightly different kind of musical elements. The film explores themes of myth, perception, rehabilitation, devotion, and self-sabotage. The plot of this film only discusses what happened after the first film, and in terms of execution it feels sloppy without a clear conclusion. There are too many musical elements in this film, but sometimes the placement and timing are not quite right, which disrupts the plot. We won't see the madness that we saw in the first film often in this film, it's only limited to Arthur's imagination. In terms of character development, it is like in the first film, only Arthur is having an identity crisis again. The cinematography is really really pretty, especially during the musical scenes, with the coloring making it feel a little colorful. In terms of production design, nothing has changed, it's still good. The soundtrack music is really pleasant to listen to, especially combined with the suspense scoring. Joaquin Phoenix's acting is definitely very good, and Lady Gaga's acting is quite impressive. Overall, this isn't a bad film but it's not good either.\",\n",

Joker falls madly in love with her and fantasizes about getting out of jail to have a life together; however, she ends up breaking his heart by rejecting him towards the end of the events.I personally think that this sequel of the Joker disappointed many for not continuing along the path that characterized the first one, that is, we practically see no scenes of violence or where the Joker gets upset. Let's remember that his defense mechanism to escape reality is fantasy with Harley and singing.We have a Joker anesthetized by love who is capable of doing anything to satisfy his partner's desires.I think that the singing scenes, particularly the duets between Joker and Harley, are well done and contribute a lot to the story; they make a good couple on screen.\",\n",

Not every movie has to be for everyone.The songs in this are fun and mesh very well with the time period. Joaquin phoenix puts on yet another great performance along with a very good performance by lady gaga (I never thought I would type that). I do wish there was more mind-bending segments and social commentary like there was in the first movie admittedly. Maybe if they were included alongside the musical numbers it would be too much.Ultimately, I liked this a whole lot.

I was expecting a film bringing Harley and Joker together on screen in a grounded setting to lead to a more interesting story, and I think they missed a trick here.What really can't be faulted with this film though are the performances of Phoenix and Gaga. This is no surprise as they are both brilliant, but the chemistry they share is also incredible. Everything they did with these characters from the design to the creative choices I thoroughly enjoyed.Then there's the musical element. Perhaps people were unprepared for a musical? The patrons of the theatre I was in certainly were, as every song outbreak was greeted with audible signs and murmurs. Personally I thought this was one of the best parts! Lady Gaga singing? What's not to love. And the musical element just really works for these characters and the relationship they had and really complimented that well. A bold choice but one that really worked for me.Aside from the lacklustre story I really don't understand the pile on for this film. Great characters and performances, inventive storytelling with the musical elements, and a good tone and vibe to the whole thing.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'The movie really pulls you in with great visuals, and those musical scenes? Yeah, some people aren\\'t fans, but they actually make sense. Arthur even says, \"I don\\'t want to sing anymore,\" which is funny because it feels like no one listens to him - just like the reviewers who miss the point. Those scenes show him happy for once, in love, so the music fits his mood perfectly. This film isn\\'t really about the Joker anyway; it\\'s more about the symbol he represents. Plus, age-wise, Arthur\\'s too old to be Batman\\'s Joker. For me, it beats the prequel by about 0.5 points - more layered, more interesting.',\n",

Throughout the movie you see the struggle and persecution that Arthur Fleck aka the Joker faces and you expect a comeback from Joker in his style. Unfortunately, that never happens. The ending gives us an idea of who Batman's Joker might be though.Liked the introduction of Harvey Dent aka two face and gave us an idea of the two face.

       "    'Review': \"I read all the reviews before going to see joker and was going into this movie with very little hope and expecting a real disappointment.But in my opinion Joker Folie à Deux Is a well-crafted dive into the psychosis of Arthurs flecks mind.It shows the flaws and cracks in society and how a deranged abused person can fall through those cracks and rise back up as a prop for hire.A prop to make other deranged people feel something more in their boring prototypical narcissistic lives. Striving for excitement and leaching off of one's pain, and their dive into murderous insanity and fascination they have for him, so much so that it propels Arthur fleck into embracing the joker persona...Harlee Quinn is one of those people.She's fascinated by the joker's chaotic murderous acts but wouldn't even bat an eye at the real Arthur fleck before the joker persona took over.The movie really shows how uncompassionate and inhumane society can really be.How humans can prop people up as some kind of superficial idol. And how quick we are to turn on them when they don't remain the plaything you wanted. It also depicts how detrimental mental illness can be.The music can be a little much at times, but it wasn't nearly as bad as people are saying. I saw a lot of reviews saying the music had nothing to do with the plot. It was very much a part of the plot if you pay attention. And in all honestly i wouldn't classify this movie as a musical its more of a thought-provoking drama with some singing here and there.All in all, i think it was a good movie that has you thinking at the end. And the ending of the movie in my opinion has fight club written all over it if you have seen it i hope you understand what im saying.Was it perfect? No. It could have been better but it's nowhere near as bad as its rating. I recommend seeing it. Form your own opinion. I enjoyed it and it had me engrossed from beginning to end.\",\n",

The movie as a whole was incredibly nuanced, as we dove further into the psyche of Arthur Fleck. It lulled slightly in spots, but kept me intrigued throughout. Now after the movie I'm still thinking about it and developing my own theories. The acting was excellent, even if the dialogue wasn't top tier, they made it work. Definitely recommend, but don't go in expecting something it's not. It's a movie that will make you think, not just have gratuitous violence for the sake of gratuitous violence. Watch it with an open mind and pay attention, or it will definitely seem boring (which is why I understand that is has the rating that it does on here).\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Okay, I just finished watching Joker 2, and it's better than what the critics are saying. It is slightly disappointing, as it doesn't deliver the Joker mayhem from the first film. However, it's a deep dive into the psychological aspects of the Joker we know as highly theatrical and mentally unstable. It's not an action-packed musical, but a Psychological Musical that explores the concept of Joker and its Impact on the man inside. The film continues the narrative of the first film, depicting how mental institutions fail to provide the necessary medications, but in Arkham Asylum, he finally receives the therapeutic care he deserves.With that being said, the film, while not as Violent as the first film, is a self-destruction of Arthur Fleck's persona (Joaquin Phoenix), The Joker, as well as himself. Is it a film that caters to The Joker/Batman mythos? Sadly the film goes more for the interpretation of the Batman mythos, in which I wish the film would involve The Young Bruce Wayne or at least some news of the Wayne Family's death, but from what I viewed and received, I was thoroughly entertained, realizing the tragedy of Arthur Fleck.Joaquin Phoenix plays his role brilliantly as The Joker, similar to the first film, but because this film is slowly breaking down why people enjoy the Joker to You don't like Joker, I think the film delves into the psychological aspect of the man who created Joker; a pandora's box if you will; and even in the trailers we see how the element of Jokers influence in the first film, has influenced Gotham for the worst. I also did not think Joaquin Phoniex's singing was that bad. It was pretty good singing these classical musical songs from Frank Sinatra to Harold Arlen, in which most of the songs revolve around the plot (psychologically speaking) and tone of the film.Lady Gaga plays Lee Quinzel (aka Harleen Frances Quinzel, aka Harley Quinn), who is quite interesting as a character. She is a character that you cannot really fully trust or believe, but I really liked how she is already someone who is devoted to Joker. Her performance in the film is of someone who is manipulative and who puppeteers the scenario that Joker is in.I also enjoyed Lady Gaga's singing. Both Phoenix and Gaga do a good job in their Musical Numbers. However, it's noticeable that Gaga is the more Talented one in the Vocal Singing range. Phoniex does an impressive job singing. This was my first time seeing him perform, and it was quite interesting to see Gaga in a DC film.The cinematography is beautiful, as is the camera's framing and movement. The way it is shot is awe-inspiring, mainly how they center on Joker's facial expressions. He contorts them within rhythm or when it pans drastically to emphasize the cruelty he has committed to Gotham. My only issue is that most of the film is in the prison or the courtroom. Still, within these areas, the film changes its imagery to the musically psychological moments, changing the environment to suit its needs to adhere to the mental struggle that Arthur goes through of who he is and what the two sides he is fighting between himself.The Lighting in this film is quite theatrical, as the clown prince of crime would like to portray himself as a shining beacon of anarchy in Gotham. The film plays a lot within the lighting and staging department, which I must commend, added to the Cinematography.The film isn't without its faults. It has a lot of musical songs (about 15 songs), but it doesn't feel overwhelming to view since most of them are mental constructs of Arthur Fleck's psyche and the world around him, which at times makes you question what is real in Arthur's mind.The other thing I felt while watching this film was that there were zero kills from the Clown Prince of Crime, but that's not to say most did not happen mentally. However, the film adds a ton of messed-up moments with the Gotham Arkham Asylum Guards and how they treat the inmates like lesser beings. No wonder most of the inmates from Arkham escape.One thing that disappointed me was the ending. It wasn't the ending I was expecting or fully wanted, but I understand the direction Todd Phillips, the film's director, wanted to strive toward.(WARNING SPOILER FOR THE ENDING YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED )The Joker dies well, specifically Arthur Fleck, as the first Joker at the end of the film. The camera pans to his shanked body while, in the background, one of the prison mates carves a smile upon his face (a clear homage to Heath Ledger's Joker in The Dark Knight 2008), but it feels a bit weird seeing our main protagonist, after so much self-destruction has happened to him, just die a lonely pitiful death.Although I theorize since two prisoners were close to Arthur, one being nice (that may have been his human side) and the chaotic one (being his Joker side) and, that in the end, his personification of Joker kills him) and that the two prisoners weren't physical people, I don't know it's just a theory.(SPOILER IS OVER)Overall, the film wasn't terrible, but I do find that the marketing was a bit misleading by making you think Joker and Harley cause havoc in Gotham. At the same time, they do not go to the extreme we saw in the first film. Still, I feel this film needed a bit of a marketing push towards the general audience who haven't seen Art films like Face of Another, The Tragedy of Preta Von Kant, or Daisies because a lot of this film is discussions with some musical moments placed here and there, but for me on a personal level while I did enjoy the film I cannot say it's a 10/10 movie it is more of a cinema thats centered toward the Art Film enthusiasts (aka ULTRA BRAIN thinkers), which looking at the box office this film hasn't done well sadly if only it were marketed better for the general audience that don't see Art films.So, do I recommend watching Joker: Folie a Deux? Yes, I recommend the watch to DC fans as a DC fan. I can enjoy this interpretation of The Joker, but is he the definitive Joker? Yes and no, it's up to you to decide; for me, he's up there alongside Heath Ledger in acting, but he mostly likely will never fight Batman, but it's a film worth watching to give yourself a bit of an introspective look into Psychology and the psychological aspects of this Joker Musical which for me this film is One of those films you got to have your thinking Caps on.I give Joker: Folie a Deux a 7/10.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Same vibe as the first one. Making a movie about what society makes you feel sometimes when nobody really cares about what you are really saying and feeling, feeling like you are not really heard by anyone. This one is more about a love story that many people can relate to; when you meet someone who sees you, hears you, and is able to read you like you always want to show to the real world. This person sees the true colors of yourself. It\\'s called love. This carries a profound message like the first but with a different touch that makes it comforting.The filming of the movie is sublime, and you can clearly see the high budget they had with these shots. Joaquin was perfect again in the role, and it\\'s easy for the viewers to have empathy with this character. Lady Gaga was a nice addition for sure, for her voice alone but sometimes it was too much... Let me explain.I feel like it was a \"dramatic musical movie.\" At certain times, it makes you feel like they just want to show off Lady Gaga\\'s voice when it wasn\\'t really needed in the scene. Joaquin has this aspect too. I found many times that I was bored by that aspect during the film. Don\\'t get me wrong, I like some musical comedies when they are done at the right time and the movie is directly going for that direction, but I really feel like Joker Part 2, a DC movie, was not really the place to show as many musical scenes like that. I mean, I\\'m pretty sure if they replaced these parts with real conversation and profound scripts that add more value than just songs, it would be a far better movie. I haven\\'t read any reviews yet, but I think I\\'m not the only one who thinks that. Besides that, the first one was a better film, no doubt about that in many ways but because Joker 1 was excellent, the expectations for the second part were surely pretty high, and I think for that reason alone, you will have some disappointment about certain things in the movie that in your head you would have done differently to make it more interesting. Sometimes it was a bit too much political, too much rules but I can understand that direction because of the plot. It may had been better again if it was less intense in that regard but I think they have also done a great job because it was a psychological drama in a sense so it was needed for sure.It had some pretty intense scenes. Some of them made my heart pound like crazy, creating a rollercoaster of emotions just like the other movie. I cried also, don\\'t really know why but at the beginning, I found myself too deep in the story, feeling like Arthur (Joaquin) deserved to be treated better than that. I found the instant connection he had with Lee so touching, and it made me smile and feel really comforted as well just like a feeling of warm in the winter.This was an intense film that makes you think about your relationships in life and how you treat people around you, specially people that are different from the \"normality\". You definitely feel the buzz a bit after you exit the cinema, and it makes you rethink the whole movie. It opens discussions with other cinephiles about your experience when watching the movie, and I think it is really well done for that reason too. I\\'d give it a 7 out of 10. Love it or hate it, the purpose of cinema and the essence of art that they capture is on point, you cannot deny it. That\\'s life...Viewed on October 8, 2024.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'The reception of the film has undoubtedly been very negative. Personally, I loved it, although I must admit that it loses a bit of strength towards the end. However, why has it generated so much hate among the audience? The answer lies in the fact that the film presents a narrative opposite to what many expected.Viewers went to the cinema hoping to see Arthur become the Joker, leading a revolution alongside Harley, and some even anticipated the appearance of Batman. Upon entering the theater, they faced the harsh reality: Arthur is not a hero, but a troubled individual pretending to be someone he\\'s not in search of love. In the end, when he decides to reject his identity as the Joker, those who previously hailed him disdain him, making it clear that they never wanted him, but the figure of the Joker. This twist has been misinterpreted as a rejection of the Joker\\'s version presented in the first film. However, there was never a true Joker; it was always Arthur seeking his relevance.As for the musical aspects, I must say that, despite not being a fan of musicals, I found them fascinating. In a traditional musical, you expect to see characters singing and dancing, but here it\\'s about Arthur expressing his feelings through music, most of the time in his mind.Finally, the most criticized aspect has been the ending, where Arthur, after rejecting his identity as the Joker and being abandoned by Harley, is killed by an inmate. This ending shocked me and seemed brilliant. If you pay attention, the inmate appears throughout the film encouraging Arthur, but when he refuses to be the Joker, his expression shifts from joy to anger or disappointment. The joke he tells before killing him serves as a metaphor for that disappointment. This ending highlights the film\\'s central message: his \"fans\" didn\\'t care about Arthur, but about the symbol the Joker represents. The moment Arthur tries to shed that identity, his followers reject him, making it clear that what they truly wanted was the Joker, not the person behind the mask. Arthur just wanted to be himself, not the Joker.',\n",

I found it an added value because it made you see the difference in his fantasy world and reality very good. But it could really be a few songs less. I understand that people find it annoying in the end.It was more of a psychological drama/thriller.You see very clearly how he struggles with keeping the expectations high of himself but especially of others and that's where he fails. Then he finds out that it was really all a show and did it purely for others but never for himself. That is for me the reason that i think its a good movieThe funny thing is that in the first movie you really get to know him as a crazy man with very weird twists. But in this movie you're kind of used to him and he suddenly becomes normal. I wonder if people like that or not.And in the end; he is a good actor.\",\n",

In the comics Joker is approximately 10 years older then Bruce but in the first one he's more like 30-40 years older ... That didn't fit.Watch the Background at the end and you will understand!The story of Arthur and what he is going through is nicely done. Him falling in love, hism thinking that he is slowly believing in himself but at the same time knowing that he is just playing a part for Harley until he makes more enemies and gets the joker r#ped out of him.The performance of all the actors is very nicely done and believable.Could they have done without the music? Yes! I don't even like the singing in Disney Movies ... But the songs itself were nicely tuned to the scenes they were in so that they fit.Overall a nice Movie, not what was expected but still nice.If you want to see Joker fighting Batman then don't watch this Movie.If you want a prison Movie/Musical with good actors this movie is for you!\",\n",

The songs get more dramatic and crazy as the film goes on and I think this was a very good way of showing just how crazy Arthur truly is. To add, the performances of the musical scenes of these films are purely brilliant. Lady Gaga shows just how much of a talented artist she is and Joaquin Phoenix truly holds his own.Although the ending has been seen as disappointing by some, I think this ending opens up this story to be expanded even more and for us to be opened to a new world of The Joker.Overall, Joker Folie à Deux is a very entertaining watch with strong lead performances. I think the struggle for people to have their own opinion and to just follow the trend of throwing hate towards something because it is seen as funny or trendy is what's destroying this films reputation.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Unnecessary sequel? No doubt.Great movie? Not at all.A terrible movie? Not at all.The second part of Joker already came with controversy at the box office and critics.I wonder... what did we expect to see?It had already been made clear in Joker 1 that Arthur Fleck is not the Joker who fights Batman in Gotham; he is just a poor bastard who on a bad day exploded into madness.Therefore, why does it make so angry that the movie had the direction it had? The search is understandable, the ways are not shared, perhaps it is slow at times, perhaps the fact that it has a lot of musical content also played against it. Musical content that in reality is nothing more than Arthur's distorted reality while he imagines a happy and ideal world with the person who uses and deceives him, seeing in him something that is not.What I see is a continuation of what was presented in the previous film: a broken man who suddenly is the symbol of chaos, anarchy, violence and who ends up being consumed by that. Phoenix's performance is up to par, Lady Gaga is not out of place and the events revolve between Arkham and Judgment Day.I think that too many expectations were placed on this film and the hate is excessive.The Joker is a symbol, in this case, played by Arthur Fleck, but he is not the Joker, he is just a broken guy. He is so destroyed that in the end he ends up being killed by a man who is possibly Heath Ledger's Joker. This would determine a perfect circle of rise and fall of a character, with the resurrection of the symbol in the form of a maniac killer who will shake the foundations of Gotham.Therefore, I personally applaud Todd Phillips' search to do something different and not what the previous film was.In success, or in error, it was attempted... unfortunately, the result was not what was expected and that is why we are at this point...\",\n",

It really does not deserve as much hate as it is receiving.Whilst there was quite a lot of potential within this film with its cast and the plot threads that were teased, it missed the mark and made strange choices which led to a rather disappointing end, which I imagine is what has caused most of the over the top hate.Most of the musical elements worked for me and did genuinely add a deeper level to the film, although there were some other musical scenes that added nothing and should have been cut entirely.Either way see the film for yourself and make your own decision.',\n",

       "    'Review': 'What starts out as a compelling and suspenseful psychological thriller loses itself in an unexpected transformation into a musical drama. The transition feels abrupt and misplaced, leaving the audience wondering what the film really wants to be.Yet the performances are phenomenal. Joaquin Phoenix once again brilliantly takes on the role of Arthur Fleck, a man who doesn\\'t so much embrace crime anymore in the chaos of his own psychological confusion. Lady Gaga, with her raw emotion and powerful presence, is a worthy addition, and together they lift the story to impressive heights. But even their phenomenal performances can\\'t completely save the changing pace and abrupt genre switch.Perhaps the disappointment for many viewers lies in what Arthur Fleck turns out to be. He is not the genius criminal mastermind we have come to expect from traditional antiheroes. Instead, he is portrayed as a man who is scarred to the core by trauma. Arthur is sick, deeply wounded, and his extraordinary ailments seem like nothing more than a failed attempt to cover up his unbearable pain. There is no plan, no strategy - just chaos and self-destruction.The film leaves you with a sense of oppressive unease, but perhaps that is precisely the point. \"Joker 2\" forces you to witness the pain of a man who is not a master of his fate, but a victim of his own mind. What the film seems to lack, however, is the balance between that inner despair and the societal responses to it, as its predecessor did so powerfully.\"Joker 2\" is a bold attempt, a film that is brilliant in moments but ultimately loses itself in its own experiments.',\n",

       "    'Review': \"Joker: Folie a Deux continues with the story of Arthur Fleck(Joaquin Phoenix), after the events of Joker(2019). Wrestling with his dual identity as the Joker, Arthur meets & falls in love with Harley Quinn(Lady Gaga), while serving his sentence at Arkham State Hospital.Joker: Folie a Deux is a pretty good film. It's definitely not terrible, like most critics & viewers are saying. Director Todd Phillips has given us a movie, that takes many bold swings by playing with multiple genres. However, it doesn't really commit to any single genre & that's the film's downfall. Making the sequel to one of the best character studies of a major comic book villain, a musical, was definitely not the way to go. The songs are not at all memorable & completely unnecessary. Each time either Joker or Harley Quinn break into song, I was just waiting for the song to end. The production design by Mark Friedberg during the elaborate song & dance sequences, are incredible & look even better in IMAX. Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal as Arthur Fleck. If Phoenix was given the same dark thriller genre that he had to work with in the predecessor, he would have knocked it out of the park. Because it's a musical, Joaquin Phoenix's performance suffers because, he doesn't really have flawless singing skills. Lady Gaga is spectacular as Lee Quinzel. Brendan Gleeson is great as Jackie Sullivan. Catherine Keener is superb as Maryanne Stewart. Zazie Beetz is incredible as Sophie Dumond. Harry Lawtey & Leigh Gill are perfect as Harvey Dent & Gary Puddles, respectively. The supporting cast is effective. Joker: Folie a Deux is worth a watch for fans of Joker(2019). However, keep your expectations super low. You will be disappointed but, at least you won't be extremely disappointed.\",\n",

       "    'Review': 'Okay first thing, which I would like to say is more about the meanings of the movie. This movie is recommended by the most artistic cinema here which has also been visited by Christopher Nolan. I think a reason why this is recommended because this is more about the life of \"Joker\" which is tragic, to say the least. The first Joker was definitely better than this, but I like the \"illusional musical spin\" on it which means Joker thought he was gonna \"build a mountain\" with Lee but it turns out \"Joker\" was eventually rejected by her, which means Arthur Fleck is a nobody. This might also be talking about societal problems, but it\\'s too deep. The symbolisms are very very very deep. What I liked is the comaprison and contrast. Gotham only cares about the \"Joker\" but when he tries to be himself, Gotham rejects him. The courtroom scenes, ya, they are kind of a trainwreck. Todd should\\'ve seen some courtroom dramas before making them. The only good thing about them is the 👆and then 👇. What I mean by them is after Arthur got rid of his lawyer, he practically wasn\\'t following court rules and going down and down. I examined all the 3 different endings, and they picked the worst. I didn\\'t like the detail of when Lee said \"They think you\\'re a bad influence on me\" which already means Lee is lying. As soon as Lee revealed the truth about her lying, I knew she was only using Joker as a pet. This is also a \"love-brainwashing\" sequence. I even think Lee hated him! But anyways, for me, there are more postitives than negatives in this \"Joker: Folie A Deux\". One last thing, I don\\'t really think this is \"Folie: A Deux\" it\\'s more like \"Joker: Insane Love\".',\n",

Songs like \"If You Go Away\" and \"To Love Somebody\" felt overly sentimental, in my opinion.Film duration:\\nThe movie is quite long, and some sequences could have been shortened.

       "    'Review': \"Since the moment Folie à Deux was announced I feel like the narrative around it has been that it just didn't need to happen. I would combat that by saying no movie has ever had to happen, the first Joker didn't have to happen but in this movies case I just really struggled to understand the appeal behind continuing the story of that first film. There was just something so beautiful to me about Joker being its own self-contained story and I was mainly worried that the existence of this sequel would undermine so many plot points from the first film that would be better left ambiguous. It's a flawed experience for sure but I kept waiting for the moment that it would lose me and it honestly never came.I think a large part of that comes down to Todd Phillips' wholly unique vision for this movie. It by no means always works but it always kept my interest. Making this a musical is a bold idea but made total sense to me given how important music was to the first film. I personally liked that it was a jukebox musical, I thought it kept the tone closer to that of the first movie, and as obviously great as Lady Gaga was in those moments Joaquin Phoenix brought out that aspect of the character in outstanding ways. I just found those sequences to be inserted in really clunky ways and for as impressively realised as they are it just left me feeling like a lot of them could've been removed and it wouldn't really have affected the flow that much.Honestly I would say for the first hour or so I as totally onboard with what this movie was trying to do. Everything that takes place within the confines of the prison were brutally well realised and I feel like it gives us a version of the Joker we've never seen before. It made this movie feel more standalone and less like it's trying to retread the beats from the original. It's after the first hour, when we get more scenes outside of the prison where things start to become uneven. It essentially becomes 3 or 4 films in one and it massively bogs down the pacing. It can drag considerably because so many scenes feel like they're unnecessarily long and it made me not as consistently engaged as I wanted to be. The court room stuff took a while to become interesting for me but once it did I found a lot of the call backs to the first film to be more impactful and less like it was just a recap of events.I also don't know that I ever found the insertion of Gaga's Harley Quinn to be as successful as it could've been. I thought her and Phoenix had great chemistry and I always bought the connection between those characters but I never really felt like she came into her own. Her appearances become more sporadic as the film goes on and I kept waiting for the moment where she had a real impact on the actual events but it never came to be. I wasn't a huge fan of how her arc ended and I have to be honest and say that the final scene left me very mixed. It's a bold swing that did have an effect on me and I can see what Phillips was going for but nothing in this film or the first one leads me to believe that this is what they were ultimately building towards.From the moment Folie à Deux was announced I questioned if Joker really needed a sequel and having seen the actual film now I still don't feel like I have an answer to that question. It is a very interesting experience that mostly held my attention and I ultimately admired the story that Todd Phillips was trying to tell here. Nothing about this film offends me as a fan of the first but I couldn't help but scratch my head at some of the decisions that were made. For as many scathing reviews as this movie has been getting, I am surprised that I left feeling more positive than most. Maybe this movie should never have been made but for better or worse I don't think it's going to leave my mind anytime soon.\",\n",

       "    'Review': \"Let me start by saying I wasn't all that impressed with Phillips' original Joker movie. It wasn't a bad movie, but it seemed quite simply like Taxi Driver and The Killing Joke smashed together. Not wholly original, and I came away wondering whether the Joker character really needs a backstory or justification for existing. I mean, isn't the lack of a backstory what made Heath Ledger's portrayal in the Dark Knight so appealing? The enigmatic agent of chaos who just wanted to watch the world burn - for no apparent reason? Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal, while skilfully done, was clearly not that Joker, nor was he meant to be.Yet somehow, it's as if the audience of Joker: Folie à Deux didn't get the memo on that. It seems like many original Joker fans, somewhat bewilderingly, expected this movie to be his glorious transformation into the criminal mastermind who would go on to be Batman's arch nemesis. If you haven't yet seen the sequel, and that's what you expect, you will be disappointed. But ask yourself - would that even make sense? At what point in the original did you believe Joaquin Phoenix's Joker to be a criminal mastermind, who could competently stay several steps ahead of a well-educated billionaire vigilante who's described as 'the world's greatest detective'?This movie is fine. It's not brilliant, and it's not awful. The musical numbers go on quite a bit and don't really add anything meaningful to the story. But I think it's a real shame for people to totally misunderstand the Joker character being set up in the first movie, and then hate on the sequel for not making him an inconsistent mess. When you read other reviews claiming there is no character development - what they mean is they didn't get the character development they wanted. Owning up to ones crimes and reconnecting with ones humanity IS character development. Realising that a need for love and connection in a brutally uncaring world has driven you to pretend to be someone you're not and led to even more division, destruction and brutality IS character development.People will probably hate this review for pointing that out, and that's fine. Everyone's entitled to an opinion. But at least be honest about your reasons for having those opinions.\",\n",

       "    'Review': '\"Joke 2\" attempts to continue the dark, gritty legacy of its predecessor, but ultimately falls short in more ways than one. One of the biggest missteps is the decision to incorporate musical elements into what was originally a deeply psychological and disturbing narrative. The inclusion of musical numbers feels jarring and out of place, creating an awkward tonal shift that strips away the realism and raw intensity that made the first film so compelling.Instead of building on Arthur Fleck\\'s descent into madness, the musical scenes detract from the depth of his character. They come across as forced and seem to trivialize the gravity of his psychological breakdown. What was once a story of the harrowing transformation of an individual into a symbol of chaos is reduced to a confusing spectacle that lacks the poignancy and emotional weight of the original.The musical approach doesn\\'t mesh with the gritty atmosphere established in the first \"Joker\" movie. It feels like the film struggles with its identity-trying to be both a psychological thriller and a musical, and ultimately failing to be either convincingly. The dark, oppressive environment of Gotham is meant to ground the audience in a world that feels uncomfortably real, and these sudden bursts of song and dance only serve to break that immersion.\"Joke 2\" had the potential to further explore the complexities of Arthur Fleck\\'s fractured psyche and the ramifications of his actions. Instead, it loses itself in flamboyant theatrics, sacrificing character development and narrative coherence for spectacle. The result is a disjointed sequel that lacks the emotional resonance and thematic focus of the first film. For fans hoping for a continuation of the gritty, intense storytelling that defined the original, this sequel is a major letdown.',\n",

It was gut wrenching, sad and the acting is impeccable. Just amazing. Especially Lady Gaga. How can someone be so talented? It didn't seem as if they just casted her because she's famous. She genuinely is a good actress. I also liked that Lee was her own character. She loves the Joker but she isn't just that (a fact that I sometimes miss in other Harley Quinn interpretations).Brendan Gleeson is amazing as well and Joaquin Phoenix did a great job again.This film was a bit weaker than the first one but highly enjoyable to watch.Closer to reality as well as the other films surrounding the Joker story.If I knew before that this was some sort of musical I probably would have been put off by that too. But it makes sense and feeds the story. It's also fun and weird, just like Harley Quinn and the Joker.So: interesting and thrilling new take on a story that have been told a few times. Definitely worth watching!\",\n",

Parts are very creative and unlike anything else, and then long stretches pass that are utterly boring. It's 138 minutes long but feels like it exceeds the three-hour mark. Whether that makes it feel appropriately epic or too often dull will probably depend on the viewer.It's also the kind of movie where I'm not sure overanalysing will help. Coppola is trying to say so much in one film, and a good part of it comes out nonsensical as a result. There were a few points during the film where I wondered if it was all some practical joke. It might mean a lot to him, or maybe only parts do and the rest of the time, he's laughing at us.Somehow, all at once, I'm disappointed, exhausted, confused, and impressed. There's a certain balance here with the entertaining and boring. Visuals that look striking alongside parts that are visually garish. It's a movie that film buffs will argue about and remember while 99% of the population will continue to live their lives in blissful ignorance of its existence.I can't quite decide whether it would be better to have be among the blissful many or the baffled 1%. I can offer no advice to anyone else who's considering giving it 138 minutes of their finite time. I'm glad I saw it and I also feel it was a bit of a waste of time.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"On one hand, this film has some interesting ideas and visuals, but some ideas never evolve, and some visuals don't look good.It's challenging to understand what Coppola's intention was with this film. It seems like he chose not to focus too much on characters but rather on themes. However, some scenes suggest that the audience should feel empathy for the characters, but one simply can't. One reason for that is the pacing of this film; it somehow manages to be fast, yet feel slow, and that might be because some scenes are dull. If we remove all the misleading character development, we are left with misleading idea development. Megalopolis bombards you with interesting ideas, but because there are quite a few of them, none of them evolves into a solid conclusion. As I already mentioned, it's hard to see where Coppola was going with all of this.If his intention was to go against the classical narrative structure and challenge viewers with a different type of storytelling, then that didn't work either. Some scenes contain clichés, and the overall structure feels like a mix of 50s to 90s scenery. One interesting thing the movie does frequently is plant a seed that sometimes does not grow-it stays in that scene, and then we move to the next one. This method of storytelling is misleading and confusing for most audiences, and it probably would work better if this technique had a solid foundation throughout the whole film. But it simply does not feel right.David Lynch once said that you can make any film, any art the way you want, as long as it feels right. His films are stranger and more difficult to understand than Megalopolis, yet when you watch Lynch's work, you don't feel misled-everything feels right, no matter how strange it is. Megalopolis sometimes feels right, sometimes it doesn't.Megalopolis is a good example of how the director's stylistic touch matters to the look of the movie. The cinematography of this film was done by the same person who shot The Master. Yet this film feels like any expensive commercial shot today-too vivid, too warm, too basic.I will definitely rewatch this film in the future, all jokes aside. This film has a shtick to it that I didn't quite get the first time watching. Overall, it's a bit sad that this is Coppola's last film, but I'm sure he has no regrets making it. After all, this is the guy who made Apocalypse Now, and I will respect him forever for his contribution to American cinema.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"Megalopolis: the greatest movie-watching experience I've ever had for such a terrible trainwreck of a film. I don't know what the heck I just watched, but my god did I ever feel connected to the rest of my audience as we all suffered and laughed through it together.Megalopolis is a mess brimming with ambition but utterly devoid of direction and cohesion. It isn't just agonizing, it is an excruciating test of patience. At best, it's mind-numbing, at worst, a total trainwreck I painfully endured.BUT! It gave me an experience I will never forget. I saw this at an IMAX pre-screening that included the live actor during the movie and a live-streamed pre-screening Q&A with Francis Ford Coppola, Robert DeNiro, and Spike Lee. The Q&A was bonkers and spiraled way out of control right after it began. It was insane to watch unfold in real-time and ended up being a great pre-game for how insane the experience to come was.And wow was it ever so much fun - laughing along with a full audience of cinephiles at the absurdity of this movie. And before you ask, no this is not a comedy, we were laughing at the movie. And yes, I feel bad, this is the legendary Francis Ford Coppola's passion project with a heavy artistic, experimental vision to it, but it just was such a hot mess that I couldn't help it. Luckily, I wasn't alone. And while the movie was largely a failure, this was the most connected I've felt to an audience and film community since seeing Avengers: Endgame for the first time. So while I will probably NEVER see this movie again, I am so thankful to have had the experience I did seeing it.I genuinely cannot believe this movie is real. Needs to be seen to be believed. I have never seen a movie quite like this before. Better or worse, Coppola made the movie he wanted to make, and it's as strange and bizarre and imaginative and insane as you expect, in every single department. Part of me thinks the movie knows how insane it is, and it just gives zero craps. But who knows? I just have no clue how to actually write about it. Frankly, I could barely explain the movie to you if I tried.You can tell Francis Ford Coppola thinks a lot about the Roman Empire because its influence is all over the mega failure that is Megalopolis. Themes of time, history, legacy, civilization, technology, politics, the media, and economics are all touched upon in this golden sun-baked, grandiose, overstuffed, and overwritten piece of filmmaking but with little to zero cohesion between them. While Francis Ford Coppola may have made some of the greatest films of all time in the 70s, Megalopolis is not one of those movies. Every member of this cast feels lost as they deliver some of the funniest line readings you'll likely hear all year. (I think Aubrey Plaza was the only one who KNEW what kind of movie she was in.) Some will appreciate the scale and ambition of Megalopolis. I would've admired it more if any of it worked, but at least I'll never forget the incoherent, messy, WTF experience of it all. Feel like I just witnessed an important moment in film history.\",\n",

       "  'Review': '\"Megalopolis\" is a film I wanted to like, primarily because it\\'s an incredibly expensive indie project, written, produced, financed, and directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola-an auteur who has been planning this work for 40 years and loves it so much that he personally rated it 10/10 on the film platform Letterboxd. Moreover, the experience of sitting in a nearly empty IMAX theater with just a few others added to the atmosphere... However, aside from Adam Driver\\'s Oscar-worthy performance and the stunning visual frames that looked beautiful on the massive screen, nothing else in this film is worth praising.The plot follows the genius scientist Cesar, inventor of the revolutionary material \"Megalon,\" with which he plans to build a utopian city of the future-\"Megalopolis.\" This is one of the film\\'s central themes-obsession with perfection in a world and society far from it. Envy, jealousy, greed, and the lust for power are other themes that shape the essence of this work. Coppola doesn\\'t shy away from weaving in political commentary as well as reflections on human existence.When I reflect on the film\\'s themes, one might think this is a good film. On the contrary, all of these themes are destroyed by narrative chaos, which in my opinion stems from the director\\'s pretentious ambition to present an unprecedented \\'megalomaniac\\' work of art. The editing and narrative are disjointed-the film jumps from scene to scene with no coherence, which became tiresome after just fifteen minutes. By the midpoint, I had completely lost interest in the story and was simply waiting for it to end.Even though most of the cast is well-known, it\\'s difficult to connect with any of the characters-most are shallow, and some are entirely unnecessary. The only character I connected with was Cesar, thanks to Adam Driver\\'s brilliant performance. His ability to convey Cesar\\'s mania, dialogue, and emotions is likely the reason I stayed engaged at all, rather than the depth of the character itself. The dialogue is mixed-sometimes brilliant, sometimes dull-which made the experience quite uneven.The cinematography is excellent, and had Coppola focused primarily on this element, this could have been an extraordinary film.In conclusion, I can say that due to its impressive cinematography, I can\\'t consider \"Megalopolis\" a bad film, but because of its awful narrative structure, I also can\\'t recommend it to anyone. It\\'s disjointed, unsure of which themes to focus on, and unclear about what it truly wants to convey. Uncertain in its very purpose.',\n",

       "  'Review': \"You can see every cent on the screen. That's the good thing about Francis Ford Coppola's latest and quite possibly last movie. Between the cast, the costuming, and the set design, which reimagines New York City as New Rome, you can see it all. The only question this raises is why was 42nd Street from Third Avenue to Times Square left unaffected, and what about the movie theaters from 7th to 8th Avenue?That said, it is natural to be skeptical of what is essentially an admiring biopic of Robert Moses. Especially when it has apparently been written by Ayn Rand as a reply to METROPOLIS and then handed to Abel Gance after convincing him he's making a movie about Julius Caesar instead of Napoleon. And don't forget the quotations from Marcus Aurelius.It is, in sum, a very learned movie. To appreciate the details, you need to have read extensively in Roman history, seen a lot of silent films, and be familiar with New York City in the second half of the 20th Century, including the flight of the middle and upper classes from the 1950s through the 1980s. Through the vagaries of my upbringing and a chaotic course of self-education, I can claim those things. So. What do I think?The performances are fine. However, I am left with the question, as I am about so many movies these days, of who Coppola made this movie for. It is claimed he spent about $140 million of his own money on this feature. The general rule is that a movie has to gross about twice its production cost to break even. I can't see a large enough audience for this to produce $300,000,000 in tickets and secondary rights. It is simply too long, a shaggy dog story about love and artistic vision being more important than anything else.This would not, of course, be the first time that Coppola has let his artistic ambitions explode on him; even though it is claimed APOCALYPSE NOW eventually made its money back, I have my doubts about that if you add in interest costs. Certainly ONE FROM THE HEART was a disaster, and he spent a couple of decades making nicely commercial movies from other sources to dig his way out, and let the wineries and restaurants make him money. Neither do I believe this movie will ruin him. There are certainly enough movies buffs around to make the net loss from this bearable.All of which goes a long way to answering my question of who Coppola's intended audience was. It was Coppola himself, an attempt to prove himself the complete film maker, instead of the fine translator of others' well told tales. I hope he likes what he has wrought.\",\n",

The film's scale and vision were so magnified that it felt like I was truly immersed in Coppola's futuristic New York. Every detail was striking, and the whole experience was incredibly powerful.Coppola funding this $120 million project mostly out of his own pocket is a bold move that reminds me of the golden age of cinema. It's a huge contrast to today's industry, where taking risks often takes a backseat. This daring choice reflects Coppola's commitment to pushing boundaries and crafting complex, unconventional narratives.Despite the production hurdles budget issues and creative disputes Coppola's determination has resulted in a visually stunning and thought-provoking film. Megalopolis isn't just another movie, it's a stand against the cookie-cutter approach of modern cinema, championing artistic integrity in a world increasingly driven by formulaic blockbusters.It might not cater to mainstream tastes, but this film is a powerful testament to the value of artistic risk-taking. It's a film that deserves to be seen, discussed, and remembered, much like Coppola's other classics. In an era where creativity often takes a backseat to profit, *Megalopolis* is a refreshing reminder that the old masters like Coppola are still here, still fighting for the soul of cinema.\",\n",

It is not a gonzo out-there cult film. I wonder if you have to be an artist to be fully taken by this movie, or a romantic. This is where all its power lies, through Adam Driver\\'s performance.

When Caesar talks about his vision, some of these moments are so beautiful they will stick with you. This presents a meta element too, we know Coppola was talking about this movie for decades. It is aiming to capture the process of dreaming, and that is more evocative than anything it can actually show us.The film is obviously made by a master director who has seen and done it all before, more Kurosawa\\'s Dreams than Southland Tales or Babylon as people keep trying to lump it in with; those were from young directors trying to make a mark and failing big. This one doesn\\'t care, it is operating in godseye. This is to a fault, it is so assured that it is challenging us with the meaning of its plot. I almost wanted David Mamet to rewrite the whole thing and give us more meat. But that is not the film.We are in a transitional era thrust into various futuristic utopias the billionaires keep planning for us. The film is running parallel about these Elon Musk sorts and their folly comparing them to the fall of Rome, and giving us all these quotes and nuggets to chew on in an almost Oliver Stone fashion, reminding me of his film, Alexander, with its talk about cycles of civilizations rising and collapsing. There are recurring frames like the bitter cousin, the Fishburne narration and the title-cards creating a beautiful rhythm across the film.We have seen attempts at this kind of art deco meeting CG style before, and it is never flattering, I am thinking of those awful Atlas Shrugged movies, Great Gatsby, Speed Racer and they always look fake; even if CGI is good, it is never as good as classic films that use practical effects, mattes and models, such as Tim Burton\\'s Batman Returns or Coppola\\'s own Dracula, both representing the peak of old school methods.Next, the casting. Paradoxically it has all these millennial clown actors like Aubrey Plaza, Shia LaBeouf, and Jason Schwarztman. While going out its way to cast specifically cancelled actors like Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight. At some moment Coppola is taking direct shots at the zeitgeist (\"Of course, everyone prefers women\"). The cast is also missing an entire generation, having no Gen X presence in the ensemble, which hurts it, as these who would consist of the bureaucrats and so forth that Driver would be dealing with.The script has been in his head for so long, there is no way that it wouldn\\'t land. The best thing I can say is that it works. Yet the question lingers how it could have been greater. Still you are getting a real artistic and interesting movie here that is worth a watch. I was also a big fan of Coppola\\'s Youth Without Youth which is forgotten today. That movie has a seriousness to it that this film lacks, but it was often dull. Megalopolis could use more of that film\\'s cerebral storytelling; between the two of them there is a great movie.',\n",

It tries soooo hard to be smart and operatic with all those archaic phrases and Shakespearean references but it's all just terribly written pointless bulls*it and the execution is somehow even worse. It is embarrassment for everyone involved.Performances are also all over the place, everyone tries something else which makes the whole thing even messier.If you are really that curious, I say wait for streaming...

The acting is great, the visuals are really good, and while some of the concepts do not make a whole lot of sense, it has a strong point to make.The world is a mess and the rich and powerful are exploiting the masses while pretending to be their ally. Is life all about enjoyment or is there more to it? The riches will be gone, but humanity can also be gone if we keep living the way we are.

       "  'Review': 'Nearly 50 years in the planning and his first film as director in 13 years, Francis Ford Coppola brings us \"Megalopolis\" a wild, bewildering, theatrical experience that takes some big and frankly unnecessary swings that almost entirely undercut the points he\\'s trying to make.New Rome is at the point of collapse. The recently elected mayor Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito) is finding his popularity crumbling as he clashes with Cesar Catalina (Adam Driver) the head of the Design Authority. The resentment is further stoked by Cicero\\'s daughter Julia (Nathalie Emmanuel) working for and then entering into a relationship with Cesar. Clodio (Shia LaBeouf), Cesar\\'s cousin and Wow Platinum (Aubrey Plaza) Cesar\\'s ex-lover plan to exploit both the wealth of Crassus (Jon Voight) and the frustration of the population to fuel their own rise to power.So, perhaps the oddest thing about \"Megalopois\" is that there is a relatively straight forward and potentially brilliant film at its core. The fall of ancient Rome, juxtaposed with comparisons with modern day America (or the West in general) is a great idea. I can\\'t imagine that Coppola would have struggled to get a studio to help, or completely finance that pitch. The trouble is - built on that skeleton of a good idea is a film chocked full of nonsense that I can only imagine that Coppola believed so strongly in, he wouldn\\'t let them go and the investors walked away. For example, and I don\\'t think this is a spoiler as it was in the trailers - Adam Driver\\'s Cesar Catalina can stop time. How and why is never really explained properly by the film, nor does this really function as part of the plot, he just can for seemingly aesthetic reasons.On top of the crazy ideas, of which time stopping is only one of them, you also have other more conventional problems, such as amateurish performances, perhaps stemming from the improvisational spirit that apparently was what Coppola encouraged. There are numerous bits of the plot that don\\'t go anywhere and way too many characters to service, both of which facilitate a bloated runtime.Still, I didn\\'t really hate it. Aubrey Plaza is excellent, and I suppose, on some level, I\\'d always prefer a big swinging failure over a safe and boring committee anodyned film. I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever feel the need to watch it again, but you probably need to see it, if only to believe it actually happened.',\n",

       "  'Review': 'Is \"Megalopolis\" a masterpiece? Perhaps not, but it did work for me as a film, and I would definitely watch it again. Loosely based on the Catilinarian conspiracy of 63 BC Rome, \"Megalopolis\" features characters based in part on figures of Roman history.Adam Driver plays Cesar Catilina, a visionary architect who wants to transform \"New Rome\" (New York City) into the city of the future, using a miracle building material he created, Megalon. The parallels to tech bros like Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Steve Jobs should certainly not be lost on us.Cesar\\'s chief opponent, Mayor Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito) is a good man who lacks Cesar\\'s vision, and who believes Cesar is a reckless, arrogant dreamer, whose vision of \"creative destruction\" will have dire consequences for the ordinary people who live in New Rome.Into the mix Coppola throws Cesar\\'s uncle, a Donald Trump- or Rupert Murdoch-type banker, Hamilton Crassus, III (Jon Voight), Clodio Pulcher (Shia LaBeouf), a jealous cousin of Cesar\\'s with a gift for rabble rousing, Wow Platinum (Aubrey Plaza), an ambitious financial reporter with designs on both Cesar\\'s affections and Crassus\\'s fortune, Julia Cicero (Nathalie Emmanuel), Mayor Cicero\\'s daughter and Cesar\\'s potential love interest, and Laurence Fishburne (Fundi Romaine), Cesar\\'s driver and the narrator of the film.\"Megalopolis\" is not a realistic movie, and it doesn\\'t try to be. Partly inspired by Fritz Lang\\'s silent masterpiece, \"Metropolis,\" and also by Ayn Rand\\'s novel, \"The Fountainhead,\" with science fiction and surrealist elements, Francis Ford Coppola has been trying to make this film for almost 40 years, and it is essentially an arthouse film with a limited budget, at least by 2024 standards.In the end, Coppola financed \"Megalopolis\" with $120 million dollars of his own money, which he got from selling off part of his winery and resorts. This is not the first time he has risked everything to try and realize his artistic vision. While very few people are as privileged as Coppola, I admire his willingness to risk so much to communicate his vision, however imperfect.As this might be the 85-year-old filmmaker\\'s last film, and as he is probably our most operatic filmmaker, I found his thoughts about the parallels between ancient Rome and 21st Century America to be worthwhile, even though they were somewhat jumbled and unclear at times.Although he holds out hope that artists will save humanity, in the end, I don\\'t think Coppola is able to descend from his privileged position to understand that no one will save us if we don\\'t act to save ourselves. Artists might be able to hold up a mirror, but in the end, they are not our saviors. We are.Disclaimer: I am aware that there are allegations of inappropriate touching by Coppola towards some of the female cast and extras during the production, and that there is currently a civil lawsuit pending against him by Lauren Pagone.And there was also some controversy regarding his hiring of \"canceled\" actors, including Shia LaBeouf and Jon Voight for the production. While I was not aware of these allegations before I saw the film, I understand that many people might not want to see the film once they are aware of these facts. Caveat Emptor.',\n",

Coppola hasn\\'t directed a good movie since the 90\\'s, so I didn\\'t have super high hopes - but I expected more than this. The editing is so fast paced and disjointed that most scenes have no structure. The acting is all over the place, and my god the special effects are BAD. There are maybe a few of the vfx shots that were okay, but most were out of a PS2 cutscene. For my short version of the review, PLEASE don\\'t go and see this for it is not worth any amount of money.For people wondering if anything was good, there are a few things. Some shots are nice, some jokes in it are funny, and the base story is interesting. This future of New Rome and a battle for the power structure within the city is cool. However the execution makes the story seem egotistical, nonsensical, and just amateurish.I would make the argument that this movie is objectively bad and shows the directors age horribly. Coppola is like 84 years old, so his interpretation of the youth and many directing choices in this movie are just completely aged. Also, let\\'s go back to the editing. Shia LeBeouf plays this prince character who is a degenerate, but I swear he never has any true conversation with anyone. It is edited so that he just says one liners for a few seconds then it cuts away. We walked out right after he says, \"Revenge is best served while wearing a dress\", or something like that.I am getting a headache just thinking about this movie. So I will end it with this. This movie is bad and Coppola should retire not only for his sake, but to save the consumer from more out-of-touch snooze fests made by old men. No this isn\\'t ageism, just a really bad movie.',\n",

       "  'Review': \"Imagine if a utopian fever dream collided head-on with the existential dread of modernity, and the wreckage was sculpted into something shockingly beautiful. That's Megalopolis, a film that feels like the child of Fritz Lang and Stanley Kubrick, nurtured by the chaos of our times. It's not just a movie; it's a symphony of contradictions, where towering ambition meets intimate storytelling.Francis Ford Coppola, somehow still operating at the peak of his powers, delivers a sprawling epic that dares to ask: What happens when the future we dream of becomes the nightmare we can't escape? The narrative dances on the razor's edge of dystopia and utopia, weaving together tales of architects, rebels, and lovers who are all striving to build something that can withstand the weight of time.The visuals are nothing short of hypnotic-a city that never sleeps, bathed in neon and shadow, where every frame feels like it could be hung in a gallery. Coppola's use of light and architecture is masterful, creating a world that is as much a character as the humans who inhabit it. The score, an electronic odyssey, pulses through the veins of the film, pulling you deeper into its labyrinth.The performances are just as awe-inspiring. Adam Driver delivers a performance that's both grand and deeply personal, embodying the duality of a man caught between creation and destruction. Nathalie Emmanuel is a revelation, bringing warmth and gravity to a film that could easily have been consumed by its own grandeur.Megalopolis isn't just a film-it's an experience, one that challenges you to reconsider what cinema can be. It's Coppola's love letter to the future, wrapped in the anxieties of the present, and it's utterly unmissable. A staggering achievement that leaves you breathless, bewildered, and begging for more.\",\n",

Contrary to the mixed reviews it has been receiving, I found this film to be a monumental achievement, deserving of nothing less than a 10/10. The critics are wrong, this movie is an audacious blend of visionary storytelling and breathtaking visual design that left me in awe.Coppola has faced critics head-on, much like he did with Apocalypse Now and The Godfather, films that were initially misunderstood but are now considered masterpieces. In Megalopolis, he once again proves his genius, creating a narrative that is both intellectually and visually stunning.Adam Driver delivers a powerful performance as Cesar, the visionary architect, while Shia LaBeouf shines as his complex cousin, Clodio. Driver's portrayal is mesmerizing, capturing the essence of a man driven by an almost mythical ambition.The film's color grading and cinematography are exceptional, blending futuristic elements with classical motifs to create a visually arresting experience. The meticulous attention to detail in the set design and visual effects underscores Coppola's dedication to his craft and his ability to create immersive worlds.What I loved most about Megalopolis is its fearless ambition and the way it challenges viewers to think deeply about society and human nature.

That's the only positive I have about this. 1/5 seems overly generous... #Rome #francissfordcopppla.\",\n",

You can do the Shakespeare thing, BUT please make the Dialogue as Coherent as Possible. It\\'s so important. If the Audience cannot Take in and process what the hell the actors are saying.

Was It Figurative? Because it didn\\'t work. Was It an actual Superpower? In that case, it was completely pointless.💩 - Listen to when Esposito says to Driver at the Very End, \"Promise Me, you\\'ll build Nobly\" 😬🤦. Tripe, just absolute Tripe. Also, Didn\\'t Esposito want to Build a Casino after that huge chunk of land went down in the demolition? So what Noble Examples & Standards is he setting?

       "  'Review': \"Spoiler: the roman empire fell.And so did this movie.Coppola wants to tell us something, but after 140 min we're not sure what. The themes (yes, plural, they are way too many) are actually interesting: creation/destruction, utopia, leaders, democracy, moral corruption, future, civilizations... all great subjects. But somehow they fail to materialise in a coherent story. Or at least storytelling. It starts off very shallow, with abysmal dialogue and characters we don't care about. How do you make Aubrey Plaza one dimensional?The whole cast is criminally underused. Adam Driver is not bad, but this could have been something big. A lot of missed opportunities here. Don't even get me started on LaBeouf.Only person who manages to add some forte is the mesmerising Kathryn Hunter. She is so captivating.Strangely there were scenes, which looked and felt like were directed by someone who just started film school. I was left baffled how this is a Coppola film. Also I personally didn't like a lot of the stylistic choices: music that sounded like my uncle had forgotten the radio on. Costumes which looked like stolen from Babylon. And don't even get me started on Jon Voights arrows.What I liked was the vision and creation of the new city towards the end. Visually it was fantastic. Inbetween the old something new emerged, but somehow intertwined. More of that please.In the end, this movie has big goals but unfortunately fails to achieve them. It's a dull, not engaging and all over the place. It's failing right in front of your eyes. So in a way...he did nail that roman empire feeling...\",\n",

       "  'Review': 'Pre-Megalopolis ExperienceSince this movie is about time, I will write this review before and after seeing it since I want to tell you how excited I am. You will know when the review begins; do not worry! I am not a die-hard Francis Ford Coppola fan, as I had only seen \"The Godfather\" and \"The Outsiders\" beforehand. The road to release has been interesting. It took 40 years for Coppola to complete and fund this, and its controversial Cannes debut led to the film struggling to find a U. S. distributor until Lionsgate a month later. And who can forget the AI-generated critic quotes in the trailer? How did they let that happen? Following these events from May onward and the film\\'s polarizing reception oddly excite me since it looks like the year\\'s most unique experience. I am not saying it will be better than \"The Substance,\" but its ambitions will carry it far. Good, bad, or mid, it has my curiosity and attention. Here\\'s hoping it is something wild!Post-Megalopolis Experience\\n\"Megalopolis\" is indeed something wild! However, its ambitions do let it down in a lot of departments. Thankfully, for better or worse, I was right in my assessment that it was the most unique experience of the year.On to the positives, aside from Shia LaBeouf in the first half, all the actors played their characters exceptionally well. Adam Driver was great as Cesar Catilina, an artist looking for what he believed to be the best future for New Rome. Nathalie Emmanuel delivers a surprising performance as Julia Cicero, the daughter of the mayor of New Rome. I was hesitant to know how she would do since the other films I have seen her in - her role as Ramsey in the Fast & Furious franchise and her miscast character Zee in this year\\'s disappointing John Woo outing \"The Killer\" - were not the best vehicles for her. I am pleased to report that she delivers a performance that stands out among the rest of the cast. Other actors like Jon Voight, Laurence Fishburne, Aubrey Plaza, Jason Schwartzman, Dustin Hoffman, and especially Giancarlo Esposito round out a dedicated cast.Additionally, the visuals are mind-blowing. From the trailers, I was expecting a visual marble, and it did not disappoint! Whether it is the moving statues, the City of New Rome, or the material of Megalon, this is the most impressive movie of the year visually so far!I also saw many incredible moments throughout the movie, such as when Cesar and Julia discover love in each other, the exceptional intro and outro for this movie, or when Cesar does drugs. Okay, for that last scene, I am mixed to positive on whether it is good since it goes on for too long. We will get back to the runtime when discussing the negatives.Furthermore, Francis Ford Coppola manages to impress directing-wise. Even though the script is not the best, which we will get to, Coppola did not phone it in. For a film that took 40 years to make, in which he had to use most of his money to market and release it, it amazes me how a director who is 85 can make a movie like no other.It is time to move on to the negatives: runtime. I am getting into the most blatant one then move on to the other drawbacks. The movie is 2 hours and 18 minutes, coincidentally the same run time as fellow disappointment \"Joker: Folie à Deux.\" I feel that that film utilized its runtime better, unfortunately. Many scenes drag or feel like they have no purpose, such as the drug sequence I brought up earlier. It makes the story feel less impactful than it already is.The narrative is confusing as well. That is not to say the story is confusing, as I understood what is going on, but in terms of engaging the audience, the movie does not understand what is necessary to bring up and what is not. It tries to show how Cesar\\'s dreams of the future may not help New Rome from falling and how people are not keen on Giancarlo Esposito\\'s Mayor Cicero\\'s ways either, but the film does not have scenes that make that point clear, at least in terms of leaving an impact. The confused narrative plays into the long runtime, keeping me from liking this film more than I thought I would.Now, the dialogue. It is trying too hard to be Shakespeare and be an Oscar contender. It is so evident and frustrating, leading to many lines of dialogue possibly making zero sense to a casual moviegoer checking this out. If there is a standout line, it would be when Cesar says, \"If you are pretending to be good, no one will notice. But if you are pretending to be bad.\" I never thought I would quote a movie in my reviews, least of all \"Megalopolis.\" There are some good lines like that here and there, but not enough to make the dialogue believable.On top of that, it decides to have a narrator in the form of Laurence Fishburne\\'s character Fundi Romaine. He is just a means to put forth a question to audiences and Megalopolis\\' overall purpose: if a city falls, does that mean the world falls with it? He does not add anything else narration-wise, at least for me. It is not Fishburne\\'s fault; it is more or less a problem with the script.For the remaining issues I have with it, the first and second halves are conflicted on whether or not to even focus on Cesar. I will not go into detail to avoid spoilers, but you will notice if you see the film.In conclusion, as one of my most anticipated movies of the year since May, I can not help but be disappointed with the film I got. Will this film get better with time, as Coppola claims it will? Moments from this film will, but I am unsure about the overall package. It has a chance, no doubt, and there are many fantastic elements, but it is one of the most disappointing films I have seen this year. Is it as much a letdown as \"Joker: Folie à Deux?\" Hell no, but it is still upsetting.Technically, it is a visual tour-de-force, the actors deliver solid work, and Coppola\\'s directing is second to none. The script, pacing, and runtime issues can not stop the technical score from being an 8/10.As for the enjoyment score, it may change, I will admit. After I posted my \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" review, it went from a 6 to a 5, so the same thing may happen for \"Megalopolis\" in a few hours, or the opposite where it gets better. Who knows? Check my 2024 Movies RANKED IMDb list to see if I am correct. As for me, there are things to love about this movie, but it undeniably has a lot holding it back. I feel it is a 5/10 as of right now. It is not the best farewell of one of the most influential directors in film history, but it is a predominantly enthralling experience. As to whether it is worth watching in theaters, however, if you have an increased curiosity or want to watch a visual spectacle, then yes, but renting, streaming it, or even buying it may be the best way to watch, in my opinion.',\n",

       "  'Review': \"Taking its lead from a Roman power struggle in 63 BC, Francis Ford Coppola's huge budget Megalopolis might be as much folly as Julius Caesar's retirement plans, but it is as magnificent as the opulence of Rome.The story is an unholy mess and suffers from a renegade style of storytelling that is at best disjointed. And yet, in its final half hour, all of the excesses of the previous 90 minutes come to crystal clarity and make perfect sense.This is the mark of a master filmmaker and that is Francis Ford Coppola and as this will likely be his last motion picture, it ought to be treated with reverence rather than the scorn that I have seen for it is Coppola's direction and vision that shines most brightly in this piece.The acting is campy and over the top and like I said the story is all over the place. But what you see up on the screen is an absolute work of art. Just as the Romans of long ago are dead what is left is the beauty that they've left behind, the art, the architecture, the works of literature and the like. And so it goes with this film - forget about the people - witness the spectacle.The acting was good, but there was nothing special. Adam Driver has Cesar Catalia the Nobel prize winning scientist who has created a miracle substance known as megalon (yay for us Godzilla fans) and who can stop time. He wants to transform New Rome (formally New York City - you know, like New Coke) in the near future and is the dire rival of Mayor Frank Cicero, a very Gus Fring-y Giancarlo Esposito who believes that we need to create jobs, have teachers, etc. In the middle of this comes Cicero's med school dropout party daughter Julia played by Nathalie Emmanuel, who takes a job and later becomes lover to Cesar. Shia LaBeouf is probably the most interesting character in the peace as Clodio Pulcher, the grandson of Harrison Crassus III, the richest man in the world. Clodio is unhappy with his life and is unhappy living under the thumb of his grandfather so he stages a palace coup writ large by stirring up the masses against the Mayor so that he can attain the power he so gravely deserves - in his mindI know a lot has been made about the fact that Coppola said that he hired actors who were not woke because he wanted to be inclusive and such. But in one of the crazier moments he cast pro-Trump advocate, Jon Voight to play a Donald Trump like figure and he does so not very flatteringly. One wonders if Voight was aware of this. Finally, one of the most intriguing actors in the piece was Wow Platinum a society, climbing journalist who is so greedy she marries Hamilton Crassus III for his money. But, despite what I've read about her performance, Plaza was just okay. I expected better. The only actor who delivered a steady performance was Laurence Fishburne who played Cesar's aide de camp and the film's narrator.What excels in Megalopolis are not the people in front of the camera but the people behind the camera and that is chiefly Francis Ford Coppola who wrote, produced and directed the film. The cinematography and production design were absolutely first rate, making a distinctly on location New York City look like New Rome.In 1982 he undertook a similar folly and created a love story that took place in a scaled-down version of Las Vegas. Did it work? Well, maybe not in 1982 but nowadays, it is considered a glorious film because it was made from the love of cinema that is sorely lacking in many of the new newer filmmakers at work today.Coppola is surely old school and yet he has always been a visionary as well. And this film has a couple of subtle nods to his previous films. Like each film in the Godfather trilogy, the movie starts with a big bold brash party and there's a terrific little nod to his war movie in which the poor children are looking at the spectacle of Megalopolis through a chain-link fence, much as the Vietnamese did while watching the Playboy show in Apocalypse now.For all its failings and there are many this is a Fable really not of Rome, but of Hollywood and of Coppola's vision that movie making must succeed.In this regard, this movie is truly One From Coppola's Heart and it should be watched and re-watchedWATCH IT3.5/5(I expect my rating will go up on a second viewing)\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"I need to share some additional information because I think it is pertinent. I went, and watched this movie with my Dad earlier this evening. While we were in the Theater periodically different movie goers just started talking, and not in a faint whisper. They also laughed inappropriately at different parts of the film... Well before the film had even hit the half way mark all of the other movie goers had left the Cinema!Also while watching the movie I was considering going, and getting an Usher to deal with these rude people being obnoxious. So as the film went a long it just became more prevalent. Luckily though they started leaving before it was necessitated.Actually in a sense that right there is one of the main things the film talks about! The hedonism that encapsulated the Roman empire before it fell, and how that same thing is rampant in our world wide society now! I can go on, and on, but I think that will suffice. I say this because this film is something incredible that must be experienced! That is with the right audience.I need to put this film in another frame to help you understand what I am trying to convey. Imagine watching the Matrix, but there are no action scenes. That instead it forces upon you the malignity that is all around us. It wants the audience to take a deep look at themselves, and the world all around them.To start asking questions. Are they taking part of the evil that is portrayed? Are they being apathetic. Are they letting vice & sin rule over their lives? Are they being pessimistic, and in turn creating a self fulfilling prophecy? Are they being the best person that they are capable being for the betterment of mankind?After the movie my Dad brought up Fyodor Dostoevsky, and we started talking about the film. How it is an allegory, and well we delved into it. I don't want to give you any potential direct spoilers. We discussed the different subject matters correlated to what we just saw. Philosophy, politics, history, religion, etc...I hate to say this, but the candor of those other patrons shows their lack of understanding. By their immature response to this thing in the film, and an immature response to that thing in the film. Their lack of caring, and consideration for other patrons watching the movie. Even the manner in which they spoke.Now some people might correlate this film to the movie Idiocracy. In the sense that the USA is modern day Rome, and it to will fall unless people take action. I hate to break it to these people, but it would fall well before it approaches anything close to the film Idiocracy.I will say this about the film. The message in Megalopolis is that of an optimist who is in a world full of pessimists. These pessimists keep on destroying everything around them. Or rather time, and time again pessimists, and actually outright selfish/evil people, destroy society, governments, nations, and civilizations as a whole. As a matter of fact they destroy life itself. Including their own lives!!!! So we must be introspective if we ever hope to succeed! It is a fable of hope for those who have the eyes to see it!\",\n",

I do think it will get re-analysed and appreciated more after the mainstream media have finished with it. Coppola knows all of this of course.

       "  'Review': 'Coppola\\'s \"Megalopolis\" is neither the cinematic train wreck nor the 21st century masterpiece generally assigned in reviews from critics who fall into one camp or the other.Paradoxically - the film is both a clunky mess and a stunning achievement simultaneously. It actually seems to function in spite of, if not due to its contradictory construction. Brilliant imaginative filmmaking creates visceral set-pieces, only for all the air to be let out of the experience with a following scene of clunky dialogue.Adam Driver delivers perhaps a career best and elevates a potentially underwritten/one-note fabled \\'savior\\' into a deeply human and powerful role. Aubrey Plaza, however, has failed to evolve as an actress since her flat non-performance in P+R, and destroys any scene she\\'s in.The writing is at times spectacular, although mostly when Coppola is stealing from geniuses like Mark Anthony and Shakespeare. The talent of the cast elevates these fleeting moments of brilliant dialogue into pure cinematic poignanceOther times the dialogue is laughably shallow and on the nose. The special effects are at times spectacular and inventive and memorable, and other times embarrassingly bad.Overall the film functions- at a high level in fact (compared to most of the theatrical slip Hollywood makes at least) as a fable and a philosophical exploration of Empire, genius, time, power, hope, and life.Ultimately, with real disappointment because I want to unequivocally recommend such a ambitious effort by one of the great American filmmakers still living- I frustratingly can\\'t help but feel robbed of an experience that was just shy of being something truly magnificent.6.75/10.',\n",

Directed with audacious vision, the film\\'s chaotic narrative structure mirrors the tumultuous reality it seeks to critique, deftly illustrating how systemic instability can erode even the most resilient of republics.The screenplay navigates a labyrinth of political intrigue, social unrest, and ideological extremism, echoing the historical disintegration that befell Rome.

The stark, fragmented scenes reflect a society on the brink, evoking a visceral sense of urgency and despair. The performances are universally compelling, with the ensemble cast delivering nuanced portrayals that capture the multifaceted threats to democratic governance.In an era where the specter of authoritarianism looms large, Megalopolis is not just a film but a prescient warning.

       "  'Review': \"Francis Ford Coppola's Megalopolis had the potential to be a modern masterpiece, but unfortunately, it falls short in several key areas. The story, while ambitious, feels overly complicated and fails to create a connection with the audience. Instead of a gripping narrative, we're given a plot that seems to be trying too hard to be profound, ultimately losing its emotional impact.Visually, the film is undeniably colorful, but the heavy reliance on green screen effects is distracting. It's hard to fully immerse yourself in the world of Megalopolis when every scene feels artificial. The constant barrage of vibrant, flashy visuals starts to feel like it's catering to an audience with a short attention span, rather than serving the story in a meaningful way.The performances are also hit-or-miss. Adam Driver stands out with a solid portrayal, and it was a pleasure to see talented actors like Giancarlo Esposito, Laurence Fishburne, Dustin Hoffman, and Shia LaBeouf on screen. However, not every performance was as compelling; the supporting female character was unfortunately miscast. Her performance felt stiff and uninspired, which detracted from the film's overall quality. This imbalance in the cast made it harder to stay invested in the story.Ultimately, Megalopolis aims to be a thought-provoking and visually stunning film, but it ends up feeling shallow and over-produced. While I wasn't bored, I found myself eagerly awaiting the film's conclusion.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"Kind of a beautiful mess of a film, Megalopolis' ambitiousness is simultaneously breathtaking to watch and extremely embarrassing for how nonsensical its execution ends up being. Megalopolis has a problem where it satirizes so many different things simultaneously that it ends up not really saying much of anything as the narrative gets overstuffed with convoluted and outrageous plot points.That being said, I do admire how bold and confident Coppola is with his vision, as he tries to make the city of New Rome feel grandiose and dreamlike. Sometimes this works in the movie's favor, as the set design is genuinely breathtaking to look at; but at the same time when Coppola tries to be extremely psychedelic and abstract it ends up being extremely laughable and silly. Another director could probably make a film that follows the exact same story beats and tone down all of the eccentricities and ridiculousness, but that film would end up being much more pedestrian and nowhere near as memorable as how Megalopolis turned out.While I am conflicted about exactly how I feel about Megalopolis, I would still end up recommending you check it out, if nothing more than to experience what a mind so far detached from modern Hollywood sensibilities can present to you on the silver screen.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"*Megalopolis* (2024), directed by Francis Ford Coppola, feels like a collection of random ChatGPT-generated scenes strung together with the hope that the audience would mistake it for a masterpiece. And, unfortunately, it's far from the visionary epic many anticipated from one of cinema's most revered filmmakers. Instead, it comes across as an incoherent mashup of pretentious dialogue, disconnected plotlines, and visual excess that only serves to confuse.Coppola, known for his groundbreaking work in *The Godfather* and *Apocalypse Now*, seems to have lost the plot - quite literally. *Megalopolis* feels like a product of throwing ideas into an AI blender and hoping the result would taste like fine art. It doesn't. There's no cohesive narrative, and the grand philosophical questions it tries to pose get lost in a sea of irrelevant scenes. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion - one that's attempting to convince you it's something profound, but in reality, it's just a disaster.The film's bloated runtime doesn't help either. By the time it limps to its convoluted conclusion, you're left wondering what exactly you've just sat through. Coppola's ambition to craft a modern-day epic has backfired spectacularly, leaving viewers scratching their heads rather than being awestruck.The visuals, while striking in some parts, feel hollow without any meaningful story to back them up. At best, *Megalopolis* is a testament to excess gone wrong. At worst, it's a cautionary tale about when visionary directors refuse to acknowledge that their time in the spotlight has passed.I genuinely hope this isn't the legacy Coppola leaves behind. If he continues down this road, there's a sad possibility that one of history's greatest filmmakers could go out as a broke man, creatively and financially. As far as 21st-century trainwrecks go, *Megalopolis* is right up there, and not in a good way.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"From legendary director Francis Ford Coppola comes Megalopolis, one of the most baffling movies I have ever seen.So Megalopolis takes place in New Rome, which is basically a modern day New York City, BUT it operates sort of like Ancient Rome. Cesar Catalina (Adam Drive) is a sort of movie version of a techno billionaire and architect and runs something called the Design Authortity. He can stop time and has invented or discovered a material (element) called Megalon that can do......stuff.....anything.....kind of in a way. Cesar has visions of transforming the city into a technological utopia for everyone. His antagonist is Mayor Cisero played by Giancarlo Esposito who wishes to prevent Cesar from transforming the city because he wants ....casinos? I think.So Megalopolis makes NO SENSE whatsoever, there is a plot in only the loosest of terms, some of the performances, mainly Shia Laboeff seems to have no idea what he's doing here, while some of the performances by Driver, Nathalie Emmanuel and Aubrey Plaza are stunning to look at, if not confounding.The movie is a marvel to behold but it's schizophrenic and baffling nature make the plot all but impossible to follow as certain story points and characters are abandoned and then suddenly re-emerge later in the movie.I would say if you have a chance to see it on the big screen somewhere, then do it, if you wait until it hits home video, I don't think it will work or make any sort of impact.\",\n",

LaBeouf brings a raw intensity and dark humour to the role that elevates the entire film, his ability to seamlessly switch between manic energy and moments of quiet, almost unsettling calm makes his character both fascinating and terrifying to watch, and in my opinion, his performance is deserving of a Best Supporting Actor OscarCoppola is un afraid to take risks, blending genres, tones, and visual styles into a film that is both unique and deeply personal. It is deserving of winning in categories like Best Picture and Best DirectorBut be warned, this film is not for everyone. Its sprawling ambition may alienate some viewers who are not prepared for its dense, operatic style and will sure to leave you with goosebumps long after the final scene rolls in.\",\n",

The narrative sometimes flows, and at other times, it feels like disjointed sequences strung together. The ending is more upbeat than I expected, although I'm not convinced it fully aligns with the project's overall message.I've never been a fan of Adam Driver, but his performance (along with most of the cast) is solid, at the very least.It's tough to form a definitive opinion after just one viewing, perhaps my only viewing, but I understand why reactions to this are so divided.

       "  'Review': \"My wife and I watched Megalopolis (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline takes place in a futuristic, post-apocalyptic city called New Rome, where two wealthy families-the Cicero family, led by the traditionalist mayor, and the Caesar family, who possess unique artistic and architectural abilities-are at odds. The mayor's daughter is in love with the young, rising star of the Caesar family and seeks to bridge the gap between the two worlds, though the men in power are resistant to change.This film, written and directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather) features an incredible cast, including Adam Driver (Ferrari), Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad), Jon Voight (Anaconda), Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix), Dustin Hoffman (Rain Man), Talia Shire (Rocky), Aubrey Plaza (White Lotus), Shia LaBeouf (Transformers), and Nathalie Emmanuel (Game of Thrones).Despite having all the elements to be a masterpiece-an outstanding cast, stunning cinematography, creative costume design, excellent lighting, and top-tier CGI-the writing was overly ambitious, and some performances felt miscast and awkward. Specifically, Adam Driver and Shia LaBeouf were poorly suited for their roles, with Driver's performance coming across as especially weak. It felt like a younger DiCaprio would have been a better fit for Driver's character, and LaBeouf's role seemed unnecessary altogether. This is a major issue because the film hinges on Driver's performance, which unfortunately falls flat.On the other hand, Giancarlo Esposito and Jon Voight delivered standout performances, but even their brilliance couldn't save a plot that's disjointed, awkward, and full of forced technological and innovative elements that don't work. The world Coppola creates is vast and visually impressive, but it isn't enough to compensate for the film's awkward pacing and inconceivable storyline.In the end, it's truly disappointing that with all these resources and such a talented cast, this is what Coppola delivered. I'd give it a 2/10 and recommend skipping it.\",\n",

I appreciate the themes. I even enjoyed the acting for the most part. But the story is absolutely nonsensical. I'm watching scene after scene after scene and I'm wondering what the hell is going on.As I said, I appreciate the film's technical achievements and it's intentions but ultimately Megalopolis is an absolute mess. I'd even go so far as to say an embarrassment of storytelling. Coppola wanted to make an art house film and to his credit he's made the most expensive art house film ever made. But surely a key element of a film, regardless of whether it's art house or not, must be that it has a plot or theme which informs the audience as to why they should keep watching - I don't believe Megalopolis has that. It is my opinion that audiences should stay away from this film to save themselves some money in these hard times. The film tries to say something but ultimately it's not well spoken and hence not worth your time, effort or money to go see it.The journey Megalopolis provides is, admittedly, a thought provoking, visually splendid one but ultimately because of it's bizarre, self-absorbed story and characters it is not a journey worth taking.\",\n",

Because Coppola should've need a better script and more time with the production design.Adam Driver and Talia Shire are tremendous but especially Shia LaBoeuf steals the show. Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight on the other hand, although it's good to see them again, their acting is all over the place. Voight has a scene in the final part that is so over the top that it feels like intended parody. And Nathalie Emmanuel's attempt on an American accent is distracted by her British accent showing up in the most random times thru out the movie.The most hilarious thing tho is Grace VanderWaal's cameo. Her two singing sequences were so astonishingly weird and out of place that it actually made the movie better. I haven't experienced that kind of funny scenes for a long time.The biggest thing that bothered me was that this was supposed to be a present continuation of the Roman Empire but yet factual events in American history occurred. In reality USA wouldn't have existed in that way I think if the Roman Empire still was a thing.Overall a trippy movie experience that doesn't follow the classical dramaturgy and instead tries a different path which is entertaining and provocative at the same time.\",\n",

He was definitely the only actor besides Laurence Fishburne that truly lived into his role. He has a very natural blend of odd charisma, comedy, and mischief that stays true to the character.Outside of that, there's some nice imagery in here with stunning neon-lit shots in the rain, crumbling statues, and large shadows being cast on skyscrapers.Unfortunately, everything else feels aimless and confused. The performances in this film come off as awkward and wooden, further hindered by odd dialogue that is needlessly superfluous in an attempt to sound intelligent. It seems like none of the actors understood the film or their characters.On a story level, there's so much going on here that the film becomes packed to the brim with ludicrous subplots that go nowhere. Many sequences don't flow into the next and there seems to be a lot of footage missing while other scenes go on for far too long. I felt like I was in the theater for twice the runtime. I won't spoilt it but there is an odd ten-minute drug induced scene that is absolute insanity that I couldn't help but laugh.Megalopolis is ultimately a story between cynicism and idealism. The film favors an idealistic outlook on the future of a crumbling society likened to America yet for being so preachy, there aren't any innovative solutions presented. Maybe that's the point and instead Coppola is inviting the audience to ponder resolutions to the world's problems.I unfortunately cannot recommend Megalopolis to anyone as it is an incomprehensible mess that feels like it was directed by a bunch of different people.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"MEGALOPOLIS may very well be the final film of Francis Ford Coppola. As such, it's either drawing praise or ridicule. I'm in the former camp. MEGALOPOLIS is a blend of Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS, with a little bit of THE FOUNTAINHEAD mixed in, though without Ayn Rand's disgusting Objectivist philosophy.The story centers around the conflict between Cesar Catalina (Adam Driver) and the Mayor of New Rome, Franklyn Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito). Cesar Catalina is the City Designer, who has a vision of New Rome as a Megalopolis, built with a translucent miracle material he's created. Mayor Cicero is greedy, and more of a traditionalist, wanting to maintain the status quo. Between them is Julia Cicero (Nathalie Emmanuel), daughter of the Mayor, and lover of Cesar Catalina.Their stories, and more, take place against the backdrop of New Rome, a reinvented New York city, if the Roman empire had never fallen. The stories are brought together by a narrator (Laurence Fishburne), who contrasts their stories against the flow of history, with a high literary flourish.MEGALOPOLIS is an at times chaotic fever dream, with dozens of ideas competing with each other simultaneously. They don't always emerge completely formed, but when they do, they amaze with their intellectual vigor (contemplation on the fall of empires), and astound with epic visuals.MEGALOPOLIS is a film that many will have problems with: a lot of audience members have trouble following 2 or more storyline simultaneously, or adjusting to tone switch between differing film styles (old school Hollywood camera to French New Wave handheld).However, if you can deal with these juxtaposition, and are willing to invest in additional viewings, MEGALOPOLIS will reward you.MEGALOPOLIS is METROPOLIS reinvented for the 21st Century, but with a little more from the heart.\",\n",

Instead, Coppola forged multifarious narratives bluntly addressing America.

The film's use of heavy symbolism glorifies this perspective, while twisting traditional archetypes to offer a 180-degree reinterpretation. The narrative subtly manipulates viewers to sympathize with a globalist moral high ground, presenting traditional societal evolution as outdated.

       "  'Review': 'Megalopolis flashes with the declarative directness, self-importance, and stylistic overabundance of a whizz kid. Yet it was made by Francis Ford Coppola, an octogenarian wunderkind, who knows as much about the art of directing pictures as anyone who has ever lived. The movie is a curated ultraviolet trip to a place of wonder and awesome views, futuristic but with a downtown wash. Stunning shots and sensational scenes gift us an uplift of discovery. It\\'s a work of scope and dimension rarely achieved in personal filmmaking.Below the fantastical surface, the film\\'s straightforward storyline is a mashup of urban noir beats--desire and deceit, grand schemes and ties that bind, double crosses and empty promises--a mindful melodrama that immerses the viewer in the expressionist milieu of the moment, syncopated sidetracks included. Then there are fabulist takes on stopping the clock--effectively, imposing freeze frames--a spin off the metaphor that tech moguls and movie directors capture \"pieces of time\" in creating a gazillion gigabytes of data and dozens of feature films, respectively.Coppola may have drawn the seeds of the fable that became Megalopolis from his idea grab bag forty years ago, but it has emerged fully formed at a perfect time. Some now feel the U. S., a modern-day Rome on the world stage, should transition to a plutocracy, leaving pluralism and common cause behind. Salting his film with terse references to the Catilinarian conspiracy, an early threat to the Roman Republic, Coppola obliquely posits a renewal of our own republic via reaffirmed aspiration and inspired visionary thrust.Adam Driver plays a big picture guy for whom the Chrysler Building is a stepping-stone. His unstinting realization of character thrills from beginning to end. He\\'s a multi-hyphenate in talent and technique looking to redesign the city state of New Rome--an inchoate inertia drifting to dystopia--to better serve the needs of its people. In a movie whose overdrive supercharges realism, Driver grounds the proceedings by fully inhabiting his transformational hero, forging an expressive connection that promotes gains out of the shade of personal loss. He\\'s on a mission to infuse science, art, and higher consciousness into life, prompting people to progress, perceptions enhanced and promise fulfilled. With a story touching on chaos, the center holds because of Driver\\'s strong portrayal.In contrast to reports of improvisation off the cuff, the movie displays the fruits of improv nurtured within a coherent scheme. Coppola was sufficiently confident--having held iterations of the story in his head for decades--and the cast brave enough, to test varied approaches to scenes, unafraid of going too far out. Aubrey Plaza, delving into freeform creativity, pushes the bounds with emotionally wrenching moments in a film that is no holds barred. Coppola ends her key scenes with close-ups, allowing Plaza\\'s eyes and expression to speak volumes in the wordless aftermath of feelings exposed and risks taken. Nathalie Emmanuel displays performative choices of another sort. Her character is deftly contained, managing to choose figurative battles wisely, applying gestures and movement elegant but measured, in support of comebacks that are either rhetorical zingers, engaging entreaties, or words from the heart. Shia LaBeouf, full on, transforms himself into a disturbed, spineless, out of his crystal skull, populist pol, full of sound and fury, even as he suffers slings, et cetera.Giancarlo Esposito, as mayor, resounds with declamatory authority on political prerogatives and power, yet later lets glimpse the eternal flame of parental love in a sotto voce pleading for his daughter. Laurence Fishburne in narration and performance profoundly joins the symbiosis of a Boswell with the dedicated concern of an Alfred Pennyworth. Jon Voight, always adept at layers, masks multitudes of intention on the way to pointed resolution. Those three are joined by other Coppola alumni James Remar, Talia Shire, and D. B. Sweeney, and new collaborators Dustin Hoffman and Kathryn Hunter, in strutting their distinct stuff to bring essence to hellzapoppin\\' happenings.There is a reason why The Godfather movies are regularly broadcast at Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year\\'s Day, despite their overload of murder and mayhem. Coppola orchestrated indelible family gatherings and interactions steeped in love, understanding, and hope, deeply felt and nuanced scenes that have earned a place in our collective consciousness, underscoring holiday themes of gratitude, enlightenment, and the possibilities of someday. But unlike the losses and abyss rendered in that triptych, corroding yet not ceding the strength of family, in Megalopolis he paints a picture of regeneration. Conflicts are mitigated. Advances are made despite pitfall horrors and hits along the way. Familial ties are reasserted and multiplied, reflective of Coppola\\'s own extended clan and a bedrock of community.Driver\\'s phantasmic phenom lets the word go forth in fervently selling his blueprints for fulfilling the future, but Coppola delivers the essential goods through the imagery of his storytelling. He applies composition, framing, astute angles, camera movement, lighting, and editing in an unrelenting flow of imagination to put over the narrative--the work of a visual artist extraordinaire. That is his legacy.Legacy brings to mind Jeanine Basinger, the film historian, author, and professor, who recently received an award at the TCM Classic Film Festival for her dedication to creating new generations of filmmakers. Quoting Goodbye, Mr. Chips, Basinger makes a point of claiming \"thousands\" of children, in addition to her daughter, among students taught and readers inspired. In that vein, I imagine an untold number of emerging directors reupping props to Coppola for his commitment to personal filmmaking and for the filmic ode on regeneration and audacity that is Megalopolis.He completes his film with a formal stroke of picture-making panache, emulating others who have sublimely capped off masterworks. Think of the horizon adjustment that closes Spielberg\\'s The Fabelmans, or the young foal entering the frame after \"The End\" appears & fades out in Ford\\'s Wagon Master. Likewise, Coppola has crafted an unforgettable finale in a movie from a member of the cinema pantheon that is not to be missed. If you truly engage Megalopolis, the moment resonates beyond belief.',\n",

       "  'Review': 'Francis Ford Coppola\\'s MEGALOPOLIS has generated an array of reactions, so it really is impossible to tell whether you\\'ll enjoy this or not. All I can say is that it\\'s probably one that will be a cult classic in a few years.The main problem with Coppola\\'s picture is that it dosen\\'t know what it wants to be. Whether it be a visually creative epic or a clunky mess. It shifts between those two a lot in this film. When it decides to be the first choice, it does have interesting factors which is evident in the colosium section of the film. But the main similaritie between both of the choices, it\\'s dialogue is terrible.The only way to describe Coppola\\'s fable is that it is a campy film, not a term I would normally use but one that describes his film nearly exactly. If you go into it with expectations similar to mine, at the door, you\\'ll most likely enjoy this film.While it does drag on maybe to long during the middle, there are redeeming features to it. First off, the CGI I think other would call entirely out of place I personally found it really fitted in. Even with it\\'s low quality, it shows something imaginary; having ourselves, similar to Ceaser throughout the film, only having an idea that isn\\'t perfect but the longer we settle in to the idea the more it fits.Secondly, Audrey Plaza as Wow Platinum is hilarious. \" One, two, three, yipe ye.\" will be my new favourite quote. Every second she\\'s on screen is such a joyous time. Shia LaBeouf is absolutely impeccable in this, so charismatic and iconic here. From his outfits and performance, he delivers tremendously.And finally, I love politics and technical graphics, so I was obviously I was gonna appreciate this.In conclusion, support Coppola\\'s ideas and sketches and you are soon to enjoy his Megalopolis, be it the performances or the politics.',\n",

       "  'Review': \"Megalopolis defies reason and expectation. It's wonderful that Francis Ford Coppola finally got to make his dream project on his own terms and filmmaking in general could use a lot more huge creative swings like this. However, this is an unfortunate testament to why complete creative freedom can be a bad idea with a nonsensical and agonisingly long film that's endlessly pretentious without the narrative coherence to back it all up.It's honestly astonishing to see such a big cast of accomplished actors be this bad in their own ways. Adam Driver is one of the best actors of his generation but you wouldn't be able to tell that from his performance here, even if it is as suitably insane as the film surrounding him. Jon Voight is so convincing as someone well past their prime who keeps making a fool of himself that it's honestly hard to tell if he's acting.Aubrey Plaza is basically in a completely different film to everyone else and somehow manages to be crazier than the film around her. Shia LaBeouf is endlessly intense so it's equally hard to tell if he's acting, Dustin Hoffman mumbles way too much and Jason Schwartzman is completely wasted. Nathalie Emmanuel, Giancarlo Esposito and Laurence Fishburne are the only ones who come away fairly unscathed.Francis Ford Coppola's direction is so erratic. There's nice shots and gorgeous imagery interspersed with an incredible amount of nonsense and a lot of unintentionally funny moments. He doesn't trust the audience at all, especially when it comes to the ending that undermines its main argument. Even with some impressive visuals, it still looks ugly which puts the $120 million budget into question since all of it clearly didn't reach the screen.\",\n",

Oh dear, um yeah... this is truly something, the way to see the film is just enjoy it because if you are trying to follow the story then forget about it because Megalopolis most certainly likes to break the brains of critics trying to do so. Taking pages of roman history and modern society, Megalopolis seems to be trying to reflect on a combination of an old and new generation which sounds good on paper but trust me it\\'s not what you expect.To describe a film like this is practically impossible, so I will go over some aspects that I like and aspects I dislike. So obviously the cinematography and CGI is astonishing, to see all of the things come together and bright lighting is truly remarkable and definitely one of the most beautiful I\\'ve ever seen from a film. Acting-wise is very solid, Adam Driver and many other cast members all do a wonderful job of portraying corruption and lust for a new empire with some surprising scenes and a strong Laurence Fishburne narrative to seal the dealHowever, like a empire, Megalopolis crumbles in most aspects notably the plot which is so incoherent and unfollowable you might as well ask yourself: \"What am I witnessing?!\"\\nLot\\'s and lot\\'s of plot holes and unbelievably odd scenes that seem to be there for show and it\\'s just so, odd! I mean it\\'s nothing I\\'ve really scene and maybe Francis Ford Coppola is trying to say something about a better world, but he sure has an odd way of saying it!Overall I would recommend seeing this just for the eye popping cinematic experience it is but if your going in it for a straightforward plot, I wouldn\\'t say do that I think it needs to be enjoyed for what it is.Grade: B+',\n",

       "  'Review': 'This movie is over the top and terribly ambitious. At times the viewer has to just let go and experience the sights and sounds that are offered. The movie is \"fellini-esque\" at times. The costumes and set designs were wonderfully creative and deftly referred to historic Roman dress while at the same time being modern. The sets created another reality altogether. I am a fan of architecture and city planning so I loved the homage to the idea that through our built environment we can create, innovate, and shape a more humane and balanced culture. It also stresses the importance of ideas, art, and creativity to creating a future that our children will thrive in. The main character is a bit crazy but he believes in himself and his dreams. We need more dreamers, creators, artists to show us the way into the \"unknown\" future.It is not narratively strong, however the story itself is simple. It is a family drama at its core. There\\'s jealously, greed, adultery, betrayal, love, revenge and sibling rivalry. There\\'s a bit of King Lear, the story of Julius Caesar, and other Roman historical figures. This movie asks the audience to use their brain, draw connections, and take a few leaps of faith. Sometimes we need a movie of big ideas to get us thinking and talking. After the movie my husband and I spent an hour talking about it. I look forward to talking to others about it. It has some weak spots but I believe that the other parts make up for the times it loses its way. All of the actors do a terrific job and Driver is fabulous in the title role. Giancarlo Esposito is also just wonderful in the role. Jon Voight is surprisingly good as well. So my advice for people on the fence is to go for it. Just sit back and let the film wash over you and then afterwards really give it a think. There\\'s so much in the movie to mull over.',\n",

Coppola uses his extensive film knowledge and life experience to put his version of his message across, and that is, change is needed and the crap we are all in.The film is visually brilliant, the story is quite mad, and I understand why this has gone over peoples heads and has a low score, it's how we are, and the bad situation we are in, it hurts, no matter how it's told. But the film works, the madness of it all is necessary, as are the way it's told orally and visually.

       "  'Review': \"Francis Ford Coppola crafted some of the best movies in American cinema and movies that have influenced many modern works today. While his recent works have been pretty rough, after a long hiatus from filmmaking, Coppola brings an epic sci-fi story and....it's a massive train wreck of a mess in both impressive and unimpressive ways.The narrative and structure of the movie offers some interesting concepts and ideologies explored but the overblown and crazy atmosphere and style causes it to feel quite full of itself as if Coppola didn't know how to connect and organize all of the themes together. I do appreciate the new original concept and there are some aspects that I thought were pretty cool. But unfortunately Coppola really seems to not understand consistency and balanced structure with this movie. Which causes the characters to feel uninteresting and providing pretty awful dialogue. Whether it was intentional to be done purposely messy as a satire, it doesn't fully work.On the positive note, many of the production colors and sets are fantastic and provided with some really good camerawork. There are some really good visual effects and presentations that are memorable for sure. Most of the performances are mostly solid but nothing too mind-blowing or fantastic I could say. The soundtrack is pretty good and I say is one of the best elements of this movie. Unfortunately, the good aspects are overshadowed with poor structure and unbalanced narrative. But because of how much of a mess it is, there are some really good unintentional hilarious moments.This movie proves that Coppola will still one of the most talented filmmakers out there but his primetime has been long far gone. However, I can imagine this would become a cult classic someday in the future.This movie is genuinely the perfect 5/10.\",\n",

       "  'Review': 'There is so much to unravel, comprehend, analyze and be either infuriated or enthralled by \\'Megalopolis\\' which may prove to be celebrated director Francis Ford Coppola\\'s final film in his wonderfully tumultuous career as a true film auteur! Coppola belongs to what I see as a dying breed of director whose singular vision overtook that of studio and audience desires. As a devotee of his oeuvre, I may be the wrong individual to judge his latest film but I attempted to enter into the sadly empty theater free from any preconceived notions of what I may experience. Let\\'s begin!The film begins atop of what is obviously the beautiful Chrysler Building in New York City. Coppola\\'s story presents this city as a pastiche of Shakespearean and Roman era states and has dubbed his New York City as \\'New Rome.\\' We are introduced to Cesar Catilina(Adam Driver) who is an obsessive visionary architect who wishes to transform the city state of New Rome into a utopian megalopolis with revolutionary material called \"Megalon.\" Coppola vaguely informs us that it is a substance that is able to transform dreams into form according to its builder. It is but two very important fantasy elements that Coppola has woven into his very chaotic, yet mesmerizing motion picture that ingeniously taps into the collective history of cinema itself that dates back to when French filmmaker Georges Méliès sent a bullet shaped rocket into the socket of the \\'Man in the Moon\\' in 1902. The other element that we are immediately made aware of is Catilina\\'s inexplicable ability to stop time around him as he precariously steps off of his enviable office perch from the top of the Chrysler Building. The story is Coppola expressing his concerns about the fall of a Republic state against the backdrop of Shakespearean-esque family scheming with echoes of Roman internecine inspired plots.There are amazing display of past and current acting pedigree splashed across the drama. I was most certainly caught off guard by the inclusion of an almost unrecognizable Shia LaBeouf as Clodio Pulcher who plays an unhinged cousin to Cesar Catalina and is positioning himself to violently take over his father\\'s banking interests as well as influence in New Rome. The welcome inclusion of what appears to be Cesar Catalina\\'s right hand man in Fundi Romaine is played with soothing reassurance by Lawrence Fishburne throughout the film and essentially he is our connection to the incredibly mad world created by Coppola. It is Fishburne\\'s voice we hear at the beginning and throughout the sprawling drama. In a film like \\'Megalopolis\\' one realizes that the director is a grand chess player moving his actors across a board of dreams. It is not an actor\\'s film per se but I will say that there is a very endearing love story performed with elegance and breathless charm by Adam Driver as Cesar Catalina and Nathalie Emmanuel\\nas Julia Cicero. They are Coppola\\'s Romeo and Juliet and as we watch them grow in love we are in suspense as whether they will share the same fate as Shakespeare had written in his famous play. I must also give special mention to Giancarlo Esposito as Mayor Cicero whom one wonders whether he is a Capulet or Montague and whose house will suffer the worst fate!A motion picture like \\'Megalopolis\\' is a reminder of a time when there was a plethora of original content that filled the big screen. It is also a symbol that this time of cinema may be leaving us and we will be the worse for it! Coppola financed this film himself after carrying this vision for forty years or so. In many ways this is an autobiographical film seen through the lens of Coppola\\'s own fantasies of his own life and obsessive cinema visions that he has given to all of us as priceless gifts. Coppola is a director and an artist that puts his own money on the line to realize his dreams. It is at once admirable, fanatical and dangerously bold and is a reminder that sometimes the price to being an artist is one that can break you mentally, spiritually and financially. \\'Megalopolis\\' demonstrates what only cinema can do for us and that is take us visually inside the mind of an artist that makes no apologies for his work. There are a scant few films that can match the attention to detail and obvious delight the cinematographer had in capturing all of the rich designs down to the buttons on the lapels of suits created for the film to the visualization of the luminous material \\'Megalon\\' that ultimately piques our sense of wonder with a finished portion of Catalina\\'s utopia.\\'Megalopolis\\' is destined to be a future darling of cinema devotees everywhere but sadly enough judging by my own experiences as being the only one in the theater, \\'Megalopolis\\' will be a box-office disaster. It is a film that if you are unaware of literary, world and cinema history-you will have a difficult time keeping up with the constant references that Coppola has chosen to include in his magnum opus of a film. Can one state that Coppola is demanding too much from cinema-goers that, for the most part, enjoy entertainment at face value only? I counter that with the success of the highly intellectual cinema experiences that can be found in the works of Christopher Nolan among others that a purely cerebral film can hit with audiences if pitched to them correctly. \\'Megalopolis\\' is a film that was released without fanfare and unfortunately I do believe that was the main nail that sealed the coffin around this film.There is no doubt that Coppola\\'s film has sumptuous visuals from beginning to the end. Symbols are strategically placed throughout the film which include beautiful clocks, the Brooklyn Bridge given a golden transformation as well as hallucinogenic injections of free flowing colors in outfits, skies and vehicles. Coppola creates an alternative vision of New York City a.k.a. New Rome that is at once futuristic and anachronistic. I watched \\'Megalopolis\\' and began to question whether I had dreamed the movie as I finished watching it. And for that alone I thank and cherish Francis Ford Coppola who has been so instrumental in creating cinema of importance and even when he fails, his voice remains vital, steady and ultimately irreplaceable!',\n",

       "  'Review': \"Megalopolis is one of those films that you know people will jump to conclusion to hate. Some will do this in the middle of the movie; some as a critic rushing to get their review out as soon as possible. I'll continue thinking about this long after my review of it which will only expand my appreciation of what it had to say.At its core, the premise is easy to understand. Will the fall of the United States mirror the fall of Rome by pushing towards a progressive future rather than sticking to traditional ideals? There's interludes and sub plots that may not initially make sense, but this does not make the film a mess. Ideally, you should want to discuss what these mean, not only in the context of the film, but also personally what you take from it. There may not be a right answer to everything, and that's the beauty of the vagueness to many of the shots, lines of dialogue, or even entire scenes. Is there anything negative to say? I'm straying away from saying it is perfect, but there's nothing I would change. It's a fable that feels like it is exactly what the director and everyone else involved wanted it to be.Not all movies make it a requirement to deeply think and discuss a movie before arriving at your grading of it, but this one does. I just hope that this will not be forgotten in years to come. I predict it will be reevaluated in due time. It's a thought-provoking artistic marvel that will be regarded and talked about just like people still talk about the fall of Rome.\",\n",

       " {'Review Summary': \"Coppola's $120 Million Guilty Pleasure Destined to Be Cult Classic or Midnight Movie Pick\",\n",
       "  'Review': 'Megalopolis, the Francis Ford Coppola guilty pleasure he self-financed to the tune of $120 million, is partly a product of the very excess and decay his film decries. The writer-director represents the royalty of world cinema despite the impression he has not made an altogether aesthetically pleasing film since 1979 (Apocalypse Now) and his reputation rests on the three classics he made in succession near the beginning of his career: The Godfather, The Conversation and The Godfather II. His having the wealth and entitlement to throw so much money at realizing his long in hibernation vision for Megalopolis mirrors the elite and wanton family at the center of this fable. When you\\'re as rich and old and venerated as Coppola there\\'s a certain invulnerability built-in to protect against a pet project being ignored by audiences and skewered by critics. At age 85 though this is likely his last film, especially given the fact it\\'s projected to make back but a fraction of that enormous production budget (the film has made only $5 million worldwide as of October 2) at theater box-offices. Even accounting for whatever the film ultimately nets through streaming services, it may be many years, even decades, before it breaks even. That is Coppola\\'s business and concern, not ours, but it does seem more of a waste than a gamble.The thing that most stands out about Megalopolis is just how undisciplined and immature much of it is, and the fault Dear Brutus lies squarely in the writing, directing and acting. Despite this, I actually like the film as a whole for its unbridled conceptual take on the fall of the American empire. It has a weird energy that I got caught up in. Trouble is, none of the ideas in this inflated think piece are particularly new and too many elements play as if they belong to an overbaked and underdeveloped student film project rather than to the opus of a film master. Assuming that Coppola had nothing but yes men around him in the creative process, it\\'s a good example of what can happen when the most collaborative of art forms is hijacked by a single dominant voice and vision to the exclusion of other choices and second guesses.Coppola has been here before. His One From the Heart, The Cotton Club and Bram Stoker\\'s Dracula took wild, expensive, indulgent swings at big ideas with mixed results. The first two of those experiments failed miserably with audiences and critics while the third was a qualified success. His fever dream anti-war film Apocalypse Now nearly ruined him financially and physically but it\\'s also arguably his most satisfying and impressive film. On much smaller budgets he showed great daring and command with The Conversation, Godfather II, The Outsiders and Rumble Fish. A less successful stylistic reach came with Tucker: The Man and His Dream.For a quarter century following Apocalypse Now he was a director for hire and he had a series of commercial hits (Peggy Sue Got Married) and misfires (The Rainmaker, Jack) before he made three barely seen and mostly maligned personal, small budget films. Twixt, Tetro, and Youth Without Youth. I cannot personally assess these later works since I have never seen them but only one of them, Tetro, seems to be regarded as something like a success.Coppola\\'s ideas often overreach his talent or ability to execute them as evidenced by his first three major studio pictures, You\\'re a Big Boy Now, The Rain People(shot partly in Nebraska) and Finian\\'s Rainbow, all of which are interesting but uneven works whose weaknesses around character development and dialogue show up generations later in many of his films up to and including Megalopolis. I can only surmise that his best films avoided the lapses of those earlier projects because Coppola listened to others in the creative process and perhaps more to the point he felt extreme pressure to make magic happen. Indeed, much of his best work correlates to when he\\'s up against it with producers, executives, investors and the like. He seems to respond well to being embattled and at risk of losing it all. Seen in this light, Megalopolis is the work of a very wealthy man who can afford a hit to his pocketbook and ego. Whether he felt any real pressure like the old days in making Megalopolis is hard to know but he had very little to lose besides a small part of his financial security and a small dent to his critical standing because in the scheme of things both his fortune and reputation are secure regardless of how poorly this vanity film project performs. In the final analysis Coppola being untouchable in this way made him his own worst enemy in bringing Megalopolis to life. It is not so much an artistic failure as it is an example of absolute power\\'s corrupting influence. In this case, Coppola\\'s own hubris was the problem. Look, no one was harmed in the making (it should be noted he\\'s denied allegations of inappropriately touching extras on set) or viewing of this movie, but with some checks and balances the film might have been saved some of its more egregious lapses in judgment and control. While there is the spine of a compelling narrative story throughout, the mishmash of Shakespeare, Metropolis, Lost Horizon, Citizen Kane, New Wave, 2001, Monty Python, Ayn Rand, Terry Gilliam, The Matrix and a hundred other references makes it a top heavy watch. One that too often tests one\\'s patience and insults one\\'s intelligence.It is as if Coppola stored up all these ideas and references points and threw them all into the hopper on this one bold film and while some of them stick and fit, others do not, especially not in juxtaposition to each other. More curating and rigor was called for to give the film the cohesiveness it needs. Entire plot elements and characters are introduced without any real context and then, worse yet, never developed. Much of the film reads as unedited, unrefined notepad musings. Yet, for me at least there\\'s still enough there to hold one transfixed if not always satisfied. It is a beautiful, simplistic, trashy mess of a social-cultural-political-historical statement whose idealistic reach is often beyond its grasp, but that\\'s kind of the point of the film. Coppola is not a pure cinema visual stylist on par with, say, Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles, Ingmar Bergman, Akira Kurosawa, Stanley Kubrick, Terence Malick, David Lynch, Terry Gilliam, and that hurts the film\\'s attempts to take our breath away with the power of arresting images tied to meta ideas. That doesn\\'t stop Coppola from repeatedly trying to go there, sometimes to great effect but often not, and that unevenness is one of the film\\'s flaws but also one of the story\\'s themes: better to reach for the stars and fail than to do the same old thing or nothing at all.Megalopolis is about nothing less than human kind\\'s yearning and need for order and fulfillment in a society marked by conflict, greed, the lust for power and too much want. The story suggests that we are prisoners of the limitations of our own civilization. There are no answers offered, only questions. The danger in real life we are told resides in standing idly or passively by while Rome burns. We are encouraged to strive for more, for better, even if that means violently overthrowing the old for the new. History tells us and the film reminds us that all empires fail and fall, and everything points to America following suit. The real question is what will follow in its place? A repeat of all the past mistakes or something new, revolutionary, more humane, more divine? Coppola\\'s Megalopolis poses the questions. Even though it is wanting expositionally-speaking in how it frames these questions it offers an experience unlike anything else out there in theaters these days. If taken in the spirit of nothing ventured, nothing gained, then Megalopolis is a ride well worth taking. Just know that there will be plenty of bumps along the way. Then, too, don\\'t expect anything to be neatly tied up or resolved, even though it tries and fails to at the hopeful end. No, this experience is best taken as a dream with its own internal logic. I wasn\\'t high when I saw it but now that I think about it that might be the best way to appreciate it. Maybe then its flaws won\\'t be so obvious.Viewed in a different light, if this truly is Coppola\\'s last filmic hurrah, than it constitutes one of cinema\\'s all-time great \"f-you\" farewells. A defiant, unapologetic, indulgent, independent swan song that, for better or worse, brazenly says and does what it wants without any studio interference. He made the movie on his terms and his terms alone, which is more than most filmmakers are able to do at the end of their careers, especially careers like his that extend across seven decades. In that way, it is a kind of triumph for the octogenarian creative set.However he feels about it, his wet dream of a movie will go down as a self-indulgent guilty pleasure he could bankroll himself, otherwise he would never have found financing for it in today\\'s Hollywood. That it is destined to become a kind of cult classic that shows up on the Midnight movie circuit is probably not what he had in mind but that\\'s where it\\'s likely to find its most enduring life. That is both ironic and appropriate, too, since he got his start with Roger Corman exploitation pics before he became a prestige film director. In a very real sense, Megalopolis marks a return to his drive-in roots. We are left with a movie by an old man trying to recapture the anarchic spirit of his youth, and that is why the film is more than a little of an anachronism. Whatever is original about it is muted by all the rehashing and mixing of influences. Even with that qualifier, it is at least not another Marvel Universe or Harry Potter or The Closer franchise entry. At least he took a real chance at doing something to move the needle.',\n",

       "  'Review': 'Wow. I respect Coppola for wanting to make this film but I have to wonder whether the man still has his full faculties.

You\\'ve seen it all before and done in a way which is more cerebral than the IQ50 that is this script. There are a couple of intended laughs. And then there are dozens upon dozens of unintended laughs, gawking at the screen wondering whether even student film classes in junior high would put together something like this.The bottom line is that if this wasn\\'t produced and directed by a person named \"Coppola\" nobody would watch this. When we heard that nobody wanted to touch distributing this film you wondered. After seeing it I wonder no more. They knew this was an insant disaster and instead tried to pawn it off as too smart and creative and full of big ideas for the public to appreciate. No, that\\'s not it. This is just a terrible film in every respect. Even the visuals, which are sometimes beautiful, are nonsensical, inconsistent, illogical, and the product of having $100+ million to spend and a group of artists willing to take it.In short, this movie is about a guy who invented a new material which can build a utopia and the family and upper class (mayor) who are intent on stopping him for their own selfish reasons. Cue in romantic interest. And have an execution that is all thumbs. Wow. Not platinum.',\n",

       "  'Review': 'I knew that views are widely divergent on the merits of Megalopolis, but that usually tells me that it\\'s probably going to be something out of the ordinary. And that, it is. But I have to warn you: it is full of literary references. You will be more likely to appreciate if you have read a lot of books. Also, you will need to have a taste for wild imagination. Some references, aside from well-known classics from the Romans as well as Shakespeare, which are very important here: \"The Fountainhead\" and \"Atlas Shrugged\" both books were written by Russian-American writer Ayn Rand. She was a strong advocate of capitalism and of the importance of allowing people to keep control of their creations. Many of her ideas and of the events in the books are actually illustrated in this movie. That really surprised me because I had no idea Coppola was such an admirer of her work. I was at a time too, but I eventually read some criticisms of her work and got a bit more skeptic of some of her ideas.Anyway, the storyline is actually much more straightforward than some reviewers seem to imply. It is a fable, as indicated right at the beginning. And, as such, it has interesting characters who want the best for humanity but don\\'t agree on how to get there. And of course, all the struggles depicted in this fantasy, because let\\'s face it, it is more of a fantasy than anything else, lead to consequences which the author conclude as he sees fit. And that is where I could see a lot of people having a hard time accepting them.One thing that puzzles me is the ease with which a large percentage of the population can accept and enjoy fantasies such as Lord of the Rings, but would reject this kind of fantasy. Too close to home? Or too bizarre? I don\\'t know.I really enjoyed this movie. It was not so much on the emotional rather it was more on the intellectual level. I did not feel it was too long as some reviewers felt. I was curious, intrigued even, all along as to where it was going. The dreamlike imagery and the idiosyncrasies of the characters are what made this movie so fascinating to me. But I definitely can understand that it\\'s not for everybody.',\n",

       "  'Review': '\"When does an empire die? Does it collapse in one terrible moment? No, no... But there comes a time when its people no longer believe in it.\" Fundi Romaine (Laurence Fishburne)Francis Ford Coppola\\'s newest epic, Megalopolis, is a challenging, energetic mashup of Edward Gibbons\\' Roman history, philosophy (Petrarch and Marcus Aurelius, anyone?), poetry, architecture, and flat-out fantasy about change in a city with strong resemblance to NYC. Although, like NYC and Rome, this sometimes-sci-fi setting is excessive but so visually satisfying that it covers the excess with endearing and repulsive characters in equal measure and ideas about the survival of an empire.Cesar Catalina (Adam Driver) is an architect with a vision who threatens to upend the city with razing neighborhoods with a strong architectural and ethnic history. Opposing him is the greedy mayor, Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito), whose daughter, Julia (Nathalie Emmanuel), loves Cesar. Although the relationships are not quite as dense as, say, in The Godfather, they are pivotal as Cesar attempts to assert his genius and Cicero retains control with a restive citizenry. Coppola allows us to see the torment in the fractured Julia, the bitterness of a dad whose daughter loves his enemy, and a transforming architect stymied by opponents of change.While the fate of the empire is Coppola\\'s primary concern, the writer-director guides us deftly with a modicum of congestion, through the political and personal mayhem accompanying any thriving city. Some may see too many characters and themes while others see a successful depiction of a dynamic, ever-growing metropolis.Coppola has dedicated decades to this project and $120 million winery money for a frenetic and hopeful vison of a fallen empire and Utopian future, neither of which is easily dispatched but leans on the promise of the future. Although it is not difficult to see Ayn Rand\\'s Howard Roark or NYC\\'s Robert Moses genius creators or Coppola himself, the epic is more about the conjunction of genius and its times, anywhere, anytime. The recent Babylon film was a similar hot mess but lacked Megalopolis\\'s sense of resignation for the past and hope for the future.The biggest hope in Megalopolis is that the 85-year-old genius, Francis Ford Coppola will pursue another magnum opus until, like empires, he cedes to the future.',\n",

       "  'Review': \"Megalopolis is the latest film by Francis Ford Coppola. It's a film I've actually been looking forward to for some time, ever since I've heard about it. I drove quite ways to see the film when I finally got the chance. I'm a fan of Coppola. I like the Godfather movies, mainly the first one. I love Apocalypse Now. Dracula is okay. I like that film more than a lot of people. This is a film he's apparently been wanting to make for decades. He directed, wrote, and produced the film. He even put his own money in to fund it. This clearly is a passion project for him, for better or worse.What also drew me to this film was the cast. I like Adam Driver from films like The Last Duel and House of Gucci. I like Shia LeBouf. I think he's an underrated actor that's gotten too much hate over the years. You also have legendary actors like Lawrence Fishburne, Dustin Hoffman, and John Voigt.This is a film I really wanted to like, despite its polarizing critical reception. Unfortunately, this film did not grab me the way I wanted it to. From the trailer, the film seemed to be a futuristic science fiction, dystopian film. The trailer oozed Blade Runner vibes. In some respects it is. There are some sci-fi elements, but it's more of a political/social drama. Maybe. Some parts border on satire or even parody. It's a little difficult knowing what to label this as.There are certainly things to like, or even love, about the film. It's a visually stunning movie. The acting is all good, for the most part, which is expected from such top tier actors. A lot of the ideas are interesting. I do like the message Coppola was trying to go for here, at least in theory. Though, I don't think he did a good job of conveying said message.If there's one word I could label this film as it's pretentious, or indulgent. I know indulgence and excess, and the dangers of them, are part of the film's message. But ironically, the film feels like the director indulging in his own ego and excesses. The film relies heavily on allegory, and its not at all subtle about it. It compares modern day America to Ancient Rome. In fact, the city this is set in is literally called New Rome. Characters even dress like Roman people dressed. Many characters feel more like allegories for something before they're people. As a result, the film feels rather preachy.The film is also unintentionally funny in many places. There were points where I chuckled, or even laughed, when I don't think I was supposed to. The film is overly long, yet the ending feels rather rushed, and tonally uneven with the rest of it. The film is quite serious and bleak for most of its runtime, but then takes a turn for the hopeful and sappy in the last five minutes. It doesn't feel earned. Again, I like the message the film is going for, but it's not executed very well.Again, this is a film I really wanted to like. Maybe on repeat viewings my opinion will improve. I do think this is a film that warrants multiple viewings. I didn't like Apocalypse Now when I first saw it either. Though, I don't foresee myself loving this film, like with that one. For right now, I can't give this movie more than a 6 out of 10. It probably deserves more like a 5. Some would ay even that's too high.For those who aren't a fan of more artsy movies, this is definitely not for you. Even more those that are, I still say you can probably wait for video/streaming here.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"I've seen a LOT of movies in my 60 years - theatre has been a lifelong passion. And happy to say I've never walked out of a movie - but this was the closest I've come to doing so. I've always been a firm believer that anything artistic and genuinely produced is worth your time, and if you're failing to find the true intent of a film - you're not trying hard enough. Not the case w/this horrific movie. Plaza is the true star of this awful film and I feel bad for her that she's in it. I'm sure the line-up of stars was very tempting for her, and to work with Coppola, too enticing to turn down. I'm also going to assume, even after reading the script, she felt he would turn that mess into gold - HE DIDN'T. I'm a big Adam Driver fan, but this was just painful from beginning to end. Maybe I'm just not artsy enough to see its value - but in my humble opinion, this movie will be very difficult to digest for many.\",\n",

Sometimes creative freedom can be good but in many cases does some boundaries have to be set, we have three arc structures because they work and we have Movie studios because they keep the boundaries of a movie (yes sometimes those boundaries can be to much) but in this case I believe someone would have had to come in and restrain this movie from not overwhelming itself. I really liked the idea of the plot, but the story didn't work as what I believe was expected. The movie can feel a bit rushed in structure and world buildup while the progression can feel really slow, some character arcs are not even fulfilled in the end which leads to the movie feeling undone. We get no explanation at all about character backgrounds or what the hell is even going on.The characters lack motivation and it is pretty sad to se that this makes almost every character in the movie feel underperformed, the acting does not in any scene feel genuine and it is a bottleneck of talent having these A+ actors get to play as unevolved roles as this.It was a good watch looking at the visuals but storyvise did the movie not have much to bring.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"Megalopolis: Francis Ford Coppola sets out to creates a parable about New York,here named New Rome, unfortunately his allegorical style doesn't quite work, at least not sufficiently to create the epic he intended. The film is full of archetypes, the idealistic architecht, Cesar Catilina (Adam Driver), an iconoclast who will destroy old buildings regardless of who is in them, brings Howard Roark of The Fountainhead to mind. Slum clearance with only a promise of a bright future. The mayor, Francis Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito) is stuck in the past and old ways, continuing the misery. The rich banker Hamilton Crassus III (Jon Voight), uncle of the architecht who has other jealous heirs. Shakespearian in scope and style, even the characters have Roman names. Soliloquies from Shakespeare's plays are scattered throughout Megalopolis, recited mainly by Cesar who fancies himself as Hamlet and he does seem crazy like a fox. There is also a soviet satellite which may impact with New Rome. Much intrigue, affairs, debauchery and chariot races in Madison Square Gardens. Elements of fantasy and Science Fiction also infuse the film. Beautiful production design, shadowy art deco, you almost expect an old style Batman or Superman to emerge. Generally good acting from an ensemble cast but thus is a heroic failure by Coppola which does';t gel together and would have benefited from a 20 minute cut in it's running time. Written, Directed, and Produced by Francis Ford Coppola. 6/10.\",\n",

The protagonist had a very troubled perspective, and that really came through. Of course nothing made sense in this film, because it didn't make sense to him.

Coppola went all out for a movie he knew would flop, and the result is something I'm going to be thinking about for a long time. This kind of ambition and innovation, even in a flawed movie, is the definition of what a director should do. The result is one of my favorite theater experiences ever. The acting can feel odd at times, and a few moments were unintentionally funny, but if you go in accepting that, it's an extremely rewarding movie. My 2nd favorite of 2024 so far.

Well maybe .... but surely not fast enough.But let\\'s go back to what might matter ... the movie felt a bit like Caligula ... but without all the nudity. While there is a small amount of it - (including some see through stuff) this never even touches the degree of that. So if you are expecting something like that, you will be disappointed. But when it comes to the amount of hyper and grand standing and set ... which also might remind you of what Citizen Kane did (see doors and other interior design stuff) ... so the movie with of course the budget it needed, is visually stunning.The actor do their best and as I learned (but already kind of was able to guess), the dialog has a lot of quote of poets, mixes up many styles (be it roman, ancient Greek and so many other stuff that are thrown in for good measure). Everyone in this has a grand time and you can tell - Shia and others that almost went away in the eye of the public ... well they have their moment to shine.I doubt it will put them back on the mainstream map, but at least they have had a paycheck ... it\\'s a mess ... but a lovely one ... which also can be said about the overall message this transports (see ending)',\n",

The movie sees him try to bring this dream into reality. Also, Cesar can control time.The biggest problem most people might have here is Megalopolis is just made poorly. The editing is quite frankly terrible as the pacing is all over the place. There are stretches in this that feel like eternity. Whilst there are things in this where you\\'re given no time to process what\\'s even happening.

Personally, I think there are plenty of plot threads that need to be fleshed out, but my biggest problem is that I just don\\'t think people would watch it as it\\'s boring enough as is.This doesn\\'t help Megalopolis\\'s attempt at intellectual debate as the entire move comes off as a self-congratulatory power trip from an ageing director.

       "  'Review': 'Conventional evaluation criteria can not apply to artistic statements of such a scale. This is well indicated by tremendous polarization, both among viewers and critics. The film revolts some, while others derive the highest intellectual pleasure from it.To an unseasoned viewer, this work may seem like a ponderous experiment. But there lies the beauty. Megalopolis is a classic epic of the post-modern era, about the post-modern era, and sustained in the aesthetic traditions of the post-modern era. Accordingly, the language of the narrative here is as disjointed as the state in which not only American civilization (the New Rome) but also the entire global society finds itself today. So Coppola got to the heart of the matter. The parallels with the fall of the Roman Empire are simply astonishing, down to individual historical characters. \"Where stands the Colosseum [i.e. The entertainment industry], so stands Rome. When the Colosseum falls, and Rome falls too. When the Rome falls, the world falls with it.\" - Coppola paraphrases Saint Bede the Venerable. Yet Saint Augustine and Jerome of Stridon can be heard here even louder.As a political and civilizational statement, this is among the most pertinent works of our time, just like Kubrick\\'s Eyes Wide Shut was in its time. But unlike the latter, Megalopolis gives hope for the awakening of humanity.Moreover, knowing Coppola\\'s predilection for re-editing and updating his work, we may see this film evolve and continue as a living work of art. Like the actual Rome following its demise, it went on to live in other forms and terrains, and so will this film, like a living tree, change its form and carry on its journey as time goes by.',\n",

It's arty leaning may see it becoming a cult classic at some point, but I'm not in a hurry for a re-watch. It does have obvious political leanings. Coppola's best science fiction?..... his only, as far as I know. It may be more attractive to a younger audience looking for something different, a little wacky, and who haven't had much exposure to some of the debates, symbolism, philosophies, ideologies it touches on.Basically, it promotes that a creative, visionary, benevolent dictator, who's found love despite his reptilian mother, is the best option for the design and leadership of a 'new world'. Someone who incorporates the best of left and right wing ideologies. As opposed to either, 1. A populist, slanderous, corruptible, degenerate, that would only use majority rules voting as a means of obtaining leadership power, rather than championing voting as a human right. Or, 2. An inflexible 'realist', Mayor/Prosecutor, that believes maintaining the status quo is the only realistic option for future planning. Whom is also comfortable with casting false accusations to maintain his position of power.

       "  'Review': 'In the interest of full disclosure, it pains me to write this, but I feel I must be honest. Legendary writer-director Francis Ford Coppola\\'s long-awaited epic cinematic fable is, regrettably, a major disappointment. After decades of stop-and-start development, the filmmaker\\'s metaphorical opus about a renowned, idealistic architect (Adam Driver) seeking to build an ambitious utopian development in a modern-day version of New York inspired by ancient Rome follows the protagonist\\'s often-frustrated efforts to get the project off the ground (not unlike the production of this movie itself). Thematically speaking, the picture addresses a number of thoughtful, significant issues about the roles of greed, corruption, politics and agenda-based motivations in matters of public welfare, as well as the importance of enabling the expression of inspired creative freedom. It also delves into the relevance of love and support in fueling the success of such ventures. However, these notions are severely undermined by an overwhelming abundance of narrative clutter and style over substance. While it\\'s true that \"Megalopolis\" is gorgeous to look at with its inventive and impressive cinematography and production design, these visual aspects become so dominant that they vastly overshadow the coherence and intelligibility of the story. Admittedly, a greater sense of clarity begins to emerge as the picture unfolds, but, unfortunately, by that point, it\\'s difficult to imagine almost anyone genuinely caring about what ultimately happens. There are also many less-than-subtle parallels between the plot of this film and the screen adaptation of author Ayn Rand\\'s best-selling novel \"The Fountainhead\" (1949), raising some questions about the authentic originality of this work. Given that this could well be Coppola\\'s final film, it\\'s a shame to see the director wind up his repertoire with such an disappointing and underwhelming effort, and some reviewers (myself included) have tried mightily to avoid being unduly unkind, perhaps delivering more generous ratings than might ordinarily be the case. Nevertheless, it would appear that this allegorical undertaking was more than the filmmaker could manage, and it shows in the finished product, quite a letdown from the director known for such classic offerings as \"The Godfather\" (1972) and \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979). Yet, if you\\'re determined to see it, in light of the stunning visuals, this is probably a production best viewed on the big screen, but don\\'t be surprised if you walk away from this one disappointed overall.',\n",

       "  'Review': \"I went to see this and had only a vague idea of what it was about. I've seen a lot of Coppola's work and particularly enjoyed The Godfather, The Conversation and Apocalypse Now. I was expecting a dramatic scifi movie so for the first 15 minutes or so I was confused. Everything seemed a little off and then it occurred to me that this is an Adult Fairy Tale. Once I understood that, It all made sense and I thoroughly enjoyed the move from there on. There are no deep hidden meanings, everything is out in the open to take in. Princes, Princesses, Evil Queens, Old Kings, Corrupt Aristocrats and of course Paupers. The real life counterparts of who the characters represent is open for interruption but I found that to be obvious and not particularly savage. If you go see Little Red Riding Hood and get stuck on a talking Wolf in Grandma's bed not being realistic because WOLVES CAN'T TALK, you probably won't enjoy the story. Embrace the Fable and enjoy the pureness of the story, don't Scrotie McBoogerballs it.\",\n",

       "  'Review': 'There\\'s no denying that this was a swing and a miss, but I\\'m was impressed enough by the audacity of the swing that I\\'m will to overlook the miss, at least to some extent.You know the setup: it\\'s a self-consciously Shakespearean epic, set in \"New Rome\", which is in America, is next to New Jersey, and has the Chrysler Building and a bunch of other landmarks that make it clear it\\'s New York City,The central conflict is between Mayor Franklyn (or possibly Francis?) Cicero, played by - of course! - Giancarlo Esposito, and Ceasar Catalina, a brilliant by tortured um... scientist/architect, I guess?, played by Adam Driver, who is trying to design and build a utopia in the middle of New Rome: the eponymous \"Megalopolis\".Because he\\'s, well, Francis Ford Coppola, he was able to recruit an impressive team of A-list actors, who do a really good job with what they\\'re given. Two really stand out: Jon Voigt as Crassus Catalina III, Ceasar\\'s obscenely rich uncle, and Aubrey Plaza as - wait for it! - Platinum Wow, the femme fatale of the story.Oh yeah, another standout is Grace Vanderwaal, the 20 year old rising singer, playing Vesta (as in Vestal Virgin) Sweetwater, who performs a song with her trademark ukelele. That was the only scene in the movie that *everyone* in our group liked.The visuals are stunning, and as I said, the acting is good, but the story is, to put it bluntly, rather sophomoric. Literally everything is a metaphor for the world today, and the social commentary is frequently ham -fisted. The overarching \"message\" is muddled and simplistic.Still, I guess in the end I\\'m just really impressed that Coppola could totally self-finance a movie that (only) he wanted to make and use his reputation to bring a bunch of first rate actors on board, even if the result was disappointing in many ways.Weirdly, the only movie I could think of that was this big of a high concept misfire was Zardoz, the sci-fi movie that John Boorman made after deliverance. It\\'s a very different movie, but if you liked Zardoz, you\\'ll probably like this.I love Zardoz.',\n",

Yes, that's right, the second half of the movie just short cuts to where it needs to get. The idea is incredible, like absolutely brilliant, but the delivery? Not so much. Coppola's last few films, from about fifteen years ago, share many of the same flaws as Megalopolis. There were some great lines and visuals.

       "  'Review': 'I saw this movie at a 9:00 pm IMAX screening with about 25 other people - mostly older men, like myself, sitting alone, like myself, each of us doing our due diligence as cinephiles to experience the latest offering by iconic \"auteur\" Coppola in IMAX - ie \"the way his much anticipated film should be seen.\"It is a movie 2 hours and 15 minutes long that felt like 3 hours long. About 1 hour in I was desperately wondering \"when something was going to happen.\" And, honestly, sadly, nothing compelling ever happened. References to Caesar aside, I suspect the movie paid homage to history in only the most abstract fashion.The cast was a curious mish-mash of younger popular actors, like Emmanuel, Fineman, and Plaza - and then very old actors such as Voigt, Hoffman, Hunter, and Shire. Most of the principal cast and crew were separated by no more than 2 to 3 degrees of separation.The movie itself, frankly, was not as provocative or visionary as the trailer suggested - with animated Roman statues and sweeping future-scapes.The split screen and video editing effects were less mesmerizing than tedious and dizzying. Dialogue was added to scenes that had absolutely no relevance and characters were falling off bicycles in the background for no explicable comport to the scene.After about 1 hour and 45 minutes I was begging the movie to \"please end.\" It took an abrupt murder attempt to briefly snap the audience out of our boredom trance. The movie had no action, no suspense, no real mystery, and an underwhelming \"climax.\"',\n",

       "  'Review': \"Rome wasn't built in a day as the saying goes, a truism summating that the city (or any city) wasn't built by one person's vision and even less the actual work and efforts of its construction.. It was/is an accretive process, a halting violent wrestling match of many hands (in the case of Rome mostly the hands of slaves) a creative organic growth of paroxysms of births - and deaths. Perhaps FFC at 84 yo is feeling this veil of tears descending on his utopian vineyard(s) catalyzing his desire to address this as his biggest theme yet - how history is constructed, experienced and built upon to progress. But whereas the biggest themes of war, death and rebirth found in Apocalypse Now was based on the genius mind of Joseph Conrad, FFC takes on the mantle of being a genius scriptwriter of the same promethium talents, which is debatable, even with the ability to realize 'mega' themes since the 1970's catalyzed or perhaps more aptly INSPIRED given FFC's purview, to realize the great themes for his Megalopolis germinating since the 80's, via the 'mega' developments of using artifice with CGI. I think he needed to give it more time. But at 84 he's likely feeling that may not be a luxury he has much more of, and as he's been quoted, not hard to understand his hopes and dreams for this film's message as he readies his coins for the boat man. In the end, I'm not sure he even asked the right questions. I'd re-read Thomas More's Utopia (again?) and give it more of a think without the Sword of Damocles in FFC's mind of a camera lens. Another recommendation, E. F Schumacher, Small is Beautiful.\",\n",

At points seems to cram scenes in for the sake of a star's cameo.Liked the idea of equating New York to New Rome, and some of the interesting conflations of ancient Rome with modern twists (though why would we be racing chariots in the future boggles the mind slightly).That Kaleesi's translator from GOT was ok, but the script left little for her to work with. Nice touch with the Greek hairstyles and costuming was mint.Dracula was way better.In a nutshell, more for visuals and some allegorical traits, but the script is unmoving and needs tightening up.

       "  'Review': 'Megalopolis is a megalomaniac project, created and funded by Francis Ford Coppola, knowing full well that he would all but lose the over $100M he poured into it. It seems almost designed to be disliked by the vast majority of viewers today, and to be appreciated only over time. It is ironic in that sense that it was financed with funds from Coppola\\'s wine businesses, which share that characteristic. You can be certain that critics will progressively pick the film up (they are starting to already) and when most look back at the 20\\'s decade, they will undoubtedly rank Megalopolis as one of its best films, and maybe Coppola\\'s masterpiece. But it will take time.The best way to describe Megalopolis is as an arthouse film made on a $120M budget. At moments, it feels like the film of a film school student on steroids, or as a foreign art film on a massive budget. It could not be farther from The Godfather or Apocalypse now. One thing is for sure: as you are watching it, you have the unmistakable feeling of watching something you have never seen before, and maybe something you will never see again.The core topic of the movie is the critical importance of art, creativity and idealism, fueled by creative freedom, to society. It\\'s set in a country called New Rome that plays no other purpose than to free Coppola from any required realism, while allowing him to speak about the United States and the world freely. Cesar Catalina (the main character played by Adam Driver) is an idealistic architect who believes in the power of doing things that are different - mainly because they are different, and whether they work or not seems secondary. Catalina has the ability to control time - a gift of all artists, it is explained to us (and of film editors more than any). He will risk his life and fortune in the process.Catalina is of course the alter ego of Francis Ford Coppola and for the first hour of the film, that is all that is conveyed: the beauty and importance of art, creativity and daring to do things that are different. But as the film evolves, the idea is funneled that these characteristics of art are actually at the core of progress in society. They are the ingredients that fight against rigid, established structures and the forces of greed. The fuel of that artistic and creative drive is love and family (a topic dear to Coppola), which is the irreductible nucleus of society that has progress naturally embedded in its structure (through reproduction). The film is undeniably political, but not in a partisan way, or focused on current politics. Rather it is philosophically political. It manages however to stay grounded and unpretentious because it acknowledges its individual human vantage point (with Catalina as Coppola\\'s alter ego).This is a vast program, and Megalopolis manages to embrace it. To tell this story with honesty, the film needs to be as free in its form as the art it intends to depict as the engine of society. This freedom generates incredible images, unusual editing, a non-conventional narrative, a mix of influences, all of which will be a pleasure to watch for film lovers (if only for the plastic beauty of the film). But it might get on the nerves of the mass audience. In interviews, Coppola has stated that, however much his film may have been criticized (a lot), nobody ever said it was boring. I think many casual moviegoers may disagree. I fear many will get bored and more than one will leave the theatre. Ironically, the movie explains that the main beneficiary of work like this is actually that mass audience, because it contributes to build a better world for them.At some point in the film, Catalina says something like \"a world where new ideas can be discussed is in itself a utopia\". Let yourself flow into that utopia, accept the unexpected, the art form, the innovation in Megalopolis. It is a unique experience, at the antipodes of the unoriginal movies that Hollywood mostly delivers today.',\n",

From what I've gathered after my experience, it amounts to absolutely nothing. Nor does it mean anything. I doubt there was a point to any of this at any point in the production.Why is Aubrey Plaza in this? Her role didn't fit. Why was Dustin Hoffman in this too? Random casting. Shia Labeouf plays himself as always. Adam Driver is ok as the lead, but his role was also underwritten and half baked. The other acting ranges from unbelievable to absolutely out of place. I mean, how you are going to bring Laurence Fishburne into this and do next to nothing with him is beyond me. Felt bad for the cast of all very capable actors. Almost felt like they were in it just to say they've been in a Coppola film.The only saving grace this film has is it's romance between the two leads. It is the only charming part of the movie, but even that is maybe a tenth of what this film is about. The rest is complete and utter nonsense! Coppola must think he's Shakespeare, because this feels like Romeo & Juliet, and it's written like it too. Unfortunately, Coppola is no Shakespeare and the writting makes the film come off as even more pretentious than it already did.The ending was the icing on the cake for me, though. The part that turned the entire experience sour. I had to keep myself from walking out throughout the bloated runtime, but then the slap in the face to the USA pops up onscreen as one of the last things said. An inversion of our anthem as a country. These Hollywood elites really make it feel like they want this world to end and this country to perish. The same country that pays their way and allows their freedoms like this hate speech to be put into films. Sick of seeing it purported into film and television. It was gross and not very classy.Overall, I hated it. Wish I could get my almost 3 hours back, after the trailers and such. Don't waste your money. If you must see it, wait to watch it for free. It is honestly the worst film I've seen allowed to go to the IMAX. Another reviewer referred to it being akin to 2003's The Room. I agree with that sentiment, except The Room has a bit of charm due to it's awfulness and film school feel to it. This is a seasoned director working with seasoned actors equipped with a 120 million dollar budget. There is no excuse for why this film is such complete and utter garbage.0 ideological philosophies out of 5.\",\n",

       "  'Review': 'So imagine that the Roman Empire survived the turbulent treacheries of the original Caesars and made it to third millennium. (New) Rome has miraculously relocated to the United States (of course the greatest country the world has ever known) and the city is run by mayor \"Cicero\" (Giancarlo Esposito). He\\'s not without his detractors, though, and one of them is the ambitious \"Cesar\" (Adam Driver) who has ambitions to reinvent their city, Nero-style, by demolishing the run down slums and replacing them with an idealistic utopia constructed of his new, eternally lasting, \"Megalon\". The city\\'s vested interests are lined up against this young man though, all except the mayor\\'s daughter \"Julia\" (Nathalie Emmanuel) who has taken a bit of a shine to the ambitious \"Cesar\" - and that\\'s much to the chagrin of his previous squeeze \"Wow\" (Aubrey Plaza) who decides that she will seek some vengeance by marrying the enormously wealthy, and aged, \"Crassus\" (Jon Voight). Add to this already rather cluttered mix, the personality of \"Clodio\" (Shia LaBoeuf) who is determined to bring down \"Cesar\" and see himself in public office - and inherit the \"Crassus\" fortune, and we have the makings of an internecine intrigue that ought to have made Suetonius and Machiavelli blush. Instead, well, we get a rambling drama that hasn\\'t a clue where it\\'s going - nor for whom it is for. It tries to mix a bit of the ancient Shakespeare (and Marcus Aurelius) into the dialogue to lend some gravitas and sense of history to the plot, but for the most part this is just a confused mess of a film. It\\'s a toss up between LaBeouf as the the over-the-top, hammy, \"Clodius\" and Voight\\'s doddery old gazillionaire as to who takes what acting plaudits there might be here, but the rest of the cast look like fish out of (CGI) water and though the production makes the odd to nod to cinema history - there\\'s a tiny bit of Fritz Lang here, I though - the rest of this comes across as an ill-inspired vanity project for Francis Ford Coppola that can\\'t decide if it\\'s \"Romeo & Juliet\" or \"Spartacus\" and in the end doesn\\'t deliver the potency, emotion, intensity or humour of either. It is a good looking film and the production designers have imaginatively created a city-scape that is ripe for the story, it\\'s just that the story isn\\'t ripe for the audience. It does need to be seen on a big screen, but be prepared to be underwhelmed as it starts strongly then simply peters out into a wordy melodrama with a few clumsily delivered messages about the nature of greed and the fecklessness of humanity lightly woven into the weak storyline.

       "  'Review': 'Lets get streat to the point. The film is a mess but not only.. lets no, get to the details, shall we ?Francis Ford Coppola latest movie is a alegory of modern america and it ressemblance to the roman empire. The plot is somehow clear and easy to understand. The story -if there is any- is about a prograssive architect who wanna advance the humane live by building a city out of a futuristic city out of a new adcanced material, but he faced the blockage of the mayor and his cousin. Okay, the story is an easy to undestand and its not a complex one (not as descriped by the critics attacking the film). The film have a clear message : we -\"THE HUMAN RACE\"- must embrace change in order to survive.Althought the movie tried to delivere to the audience this \"noble\" letter, it failed on so many levels. Specially comming from the Godfather director.The imagery shows that Coppola really tried to make an intelectual, kind of deep, profound motion picture. He used \"artistic\" montage, filling-up the two hours with abstract psychedelic scenes. But failed as using them the right way. It looks like the director tried to make an artistic peace in the sake of doing it. He tried to end his long succesfull career with something meaninfull but ended up messing it. The movie is an ensemble of artistics coming from high society scenes, and pervert absolutly-not-necessary ones. As i believe, art is not the describtion of the artist toward reality but his attribution to it. Megalopolis fault is it tried to gives the audience lessons on how to approach life and progress. No one is intitled to teach the audience how to think. Even God have no saying on how the human -its subjects- behave, he just an accountant of the good and the bad. God is watching us not teaching us. So their is no reason a director should teach an audience what to think.That\\'s about the philosophicality of the movie, let\\'s get into the technicality.As i said, the script is definetly an unfinished work as the story is not just interesting but also dont level-up to the level of the messaging Coppola triying to deliver. The cousin played by Shia LaBeouf, the mistress played by Aubret Plaza and all those filling-the-gabs caracters are just not interesting. The dialogue is meant to be not told. The scene are too vulgaire and incoherent. All of this make the movie a piece that tried so hard to tell a story in an intelectual way but failed to those raison. If Coppola focused on the main caracteres and really deepen those backstories he could\\'ve ended up with a better final product.The cinematography is acceptable however. But i\\'ve seen so much better for a 120 million movie. The rythm of the movie is a mix of latest paul thomas anderson movies and the SNL. Some editing technics are just not a good fit for this movie. You can\\'t mix those two styles.Anyway, Coppola\\'s career as a contrarian film-maker is what pushed him to take the decision to make this one. That bravery and courage is respected. This movie have some good ideas, but too much bad choices were taken. It will definetly fail to meet the audience.',\n",

An exploration of where things come from and what they become, and how these things are both interrelated with how we view ourselves in the present. How we talk about ourselves and others have the potential to heal or break the foundations of who we are.This film will most likely be talked about in the close future as an enigma or a misstep, but as a sensory and emotional experience it tears up the fabric of what cinema is about and brings excitement and joy in its radical positivity. The result is a work of beauty with a sensuous rhythm that lulls you into itself and holds you in its arms.We're so used to viewing the world through the eyes of a critic, and it's refreshing to see a vision that does away with that. Splurges of emotions that come closer to what it's like being a kid again experiencing the world for the first time, rather than falling into the potholes of endless discourse, being caught in the wheels of time. An exuberant, playful journey inward which we all so desperately need.\",\n",

There was no story, no genuine humanity, and no point to the whole enterprise. It was just two and a quarter hours of nonsensical, pretentious drivel.The cast was made up of attractive, accomplished actors who have all done interesting work in the past but none of them could inject any life or meaning into this vacuum. Poor Aubrey Plaza (a main reason why I wanted to see it) was saddled with such an absurd part that she evoked unintended laughter more than once. And famous names like Adam Driver, Giancarlo Esposito, Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight couldn't divert from the general feeling that there was nothing worth watching on the screen.At least Nathalie Emmanuel provided some much-needed eye candy.\",\n",

       " {'Review Summary': 'A spectacle and a disaster!',\n",
       "  'Review': \"Francis Ford Coppola has been dreaming of making Megalopolis for decades. This was supposed to be his magnum opus, the film to define his career-a bold, ambitious vision of an urban utopia plagued by ambition and decay. But, to put it mildly, the movie flops. While it's undeniably a spectacle, it's not the kind you'll be eager to behold twice. Even after two hours in the theater, I found myself searching online to understand what exactly I'd just witnessed.For those who don't know, Megalopolis was meant to capture Coppola's vision of a perfect city and the inherent flaws that come with human ambition. A depiction of the fall of Rome, but set in modern New York. This theme is intriguing but sorely underwhelming in execution. Perhaps it's a metaphor for Coppola's own career, from the glory days of The Godfather to the challenges he faced after founding Zoetrope Studios, a venture that nearly bankrupted him. Megalopolis seems almost autobiographical in a sense, a cinematic metaphor of his struggles in an industry that has not always rewarded his risk-taking.Shia LaBeouf is, without a doubt, the highlight of the movie. He brings a chaotic energy that makes his character both entertaining and memorable. He seems to revel in his role, creating one of the film's few bright spots. Following close behind is Aubrey Plaza, who plays a provocative character who schemes and manipulates her way through the film. Though her character isn't exactly likable, Plaza's performance is undoubtedly engaging.On the other hand, Adam Driver's performance feels like a missed opportunity. His portrayal is flat, lacking the charisma and intensity that might have brought his character to life. Though Driver is known for his powerful performances, here he seems overshadowed by his more eccentric co-stars.Jon Voight also deserves a mention as one of the film's funniest characters. His dry wit and perfectly timed one-liners add an unexpected layer of humor that keeps the movie from becoming unbearably dreary. He's the third most entertaining character, bringing a rare sense of levity to an otherwise heavy-handed narrative.Nathalie Emmanuel's character starts off unlikable but grows on you by the end. Her arc becomes more profound as the movie progresses, adding depth to a cast mostly focused on dramatics and extravagance.Dustin Hoffman makes a brief appearance, and although his role is small, he manages to deliver a couple of laugh-out-loud moments. Jason Schwartzman also pops up a few times, delivering a few laughs as well, though he doesn't steal the show as much as some of the others.And then there's Laurence Fishburne, whose narration might be one of the film's few redeeming qualities. His voiceover work is compelling, grounding the film's lofty, sometimes confusing concepts with a gravitas only he could deliver. It's easily one of the best narrative performances he's given in recent years.The viewing experience was bizarre. There were only four other people in the theater with me, and as the film progressed, it turned into a chaotic spectacle. Most of us were laughing out loud, reacting to how bad it was becoming. There were even moments of pure shock, where the absurdity of what was happening on screen left us all genuinely baffled.Megalopolis is a film that tried to do too much and achieved too little. It's ambitious, yes, and visually stunning, but ambition without direction leads to a muddled mess.\",\n",

       "  'Review': 'With Megalopolis, Francis Ford Coppola makes a long-awaited return to filmmaking, and it\\'s clear he hasn\\'t chosen the easy path. This monumental and unclassifiable film, oscillating between metaphysical science fiction and utopian reflection, stands out as an ambitious and rare work-both visually spectacular and philosophically dense. By immersing us in a futuristic city named \"New Rome,\" Coppola paints a portrait of a civilization teetering on the edge, while also delving into universal themes like power, ambition, and the quest for transcendence.A Hypnotic Visual Spectacle\\nFrom the very first moments, Megalopolis strikes with its visual grandeur. Every frame seems meticulously crafted like a piece of art, with a masterful use of light and color. The film employs a \"contrasting chromaticism,\" frequently juxtaposing the cold, futuristic tones of the city with warmer hues-symbols of either hope or disillusionment. This palette enhances the immersive atmosphere, at times veering into the dreamlike, making the viewer feel as though they are traversing a city both tangible and imagined. Certain sequences embrace abstraction, bordering on the experimental, blurring the lines between reality and dream, as if we are witnessing fragments of the characters\\' inner worlds. While this choice can be disorienting, it adds layers to the experience, inviting the viewer to explore these blurred boundaries between imagination and memory.A Film Open to Multiple Interpretations\\nMegalopolis resists a singular interpretation. Each viewing seems to unveil new layers of meaning. In this way, the film embodies a true \"palimpsestic aesthetic,\" where different narrative layers overlap and interact, allowing for multiple perspectives. Some scenes appear to be products of the characters\\' imaginations, giving the narrative a subjective tone that opens various interpretative avenues. This intentional ambiguity can be disconcerting, but it also forms part of the film\\'s allure, offering no clear answers and encouraging introspection. Coppola seems to place faith in the audience\\'s curiosity and intelligence, transforming the viewer into a co-creator of meaning.The Unclassifiable Nature of Megalopolis\\nIt\\'s difficult to categorize Megalopolis. Straddling the line between dystopian fable, introspective drama, and science fiction, the film escapes conventional genre boundaries. A parallel can be drawn to Tarkovsky\\'s cinema, especially in the way the film stretches time and invites contemplation. The pace is slow, at times meditative, allowing the viewer to fully immerse themselves in this universe, which feels both familiar and alien. In this sense, Megalopolis fits into the tradition of contemplative cinema, where form serves both philosophical reflection and narrative. This is a work that takes its time, giving us the space to breathe, reflect, and stands in stark contrast to the fast-paced action films we are used to.A Reflection on Power and Utopia\\nOne of the film\\'s most intriguing elements is its political and philosophical dimension. Through the character of the architect leading New Rome, Coppola questions the possibility of building a utopia in a world dominated by chaos and power struggles. This ambivalent figure, torn between grand ambition and existential doubt, embodies a modern-day Faust, conflicted between the desire to change the world and the inescapable realities beyond his control. The film thus becomes a fable about the eternal conflict between the dream of a better world and the inherent limitations of the human condition. New Rome, the towering architectural achievement, serves as a metaphor for this struggle-both a monumental feat and a symbol of fragility. The city reflects the aspirations and fears of its inhabitants, becoming a mirror for the internal tensions of the characters themselves.Architecture as a Central Character\\nIt\\'s impossible to discuss Megalopolis without focusing on the crucial role of architecture. New Rome is not merely a backdrop; it acts as a character in its own right, representing both the utopias and nightmares of its citizens. The city\\'s urban design, with its monumental scope, becomes a storytelling device. Every structure and building is laden with symbolic meaning, simultaneously evoking the grandeur and the potential downfall of civilization. In this sense, Coppola continues the reflection initiated in Apocalypse Now on how physical environments shape human psychology. The city becomes a space for both creation and destruction-an idealized utopia that teeters on the edge of collapse, weighed down by its internal contradictions.A Metaphysical and Introspective Work\\nWith Megalopolis, Coppola isn\\'t merely telling a story; he\\'s posing questions about life\\'s meaning, human ambition, and the search for transcendence. Much like Tarkovsky, he invites the viewer to emotionally detach, not to be passively immersed in the narrative, but rather to reflect on what\\'s being presented. This \"detachment\" enables us to see beyond the characters and their actions, engaging in a broader, almost metaphysical contemplation of civilization and its inevitable failures. The dialogue, often laden with philosophical weight, opens intellectual avenues that the viewer is free to explore-or not. This technique creates an emotional distance but also offers space for meditation, where we can project ourselves into the moral and existential dilemmas faced by the characters.Conclusion: A Challenge for the Viewer\\nWith Megalopolis, Francis Ford Coppola delivers an unclassifiable, complex, and daring work. It\\'s not an easily accessible film, and it may unsettle those expecting a more straightforward narrative or fast pace. But for those willing to immerse themselves in its world, to embrace its ambiguity and be drawn into its intellectual depth, Megalopolis offers a unique experience. Visually striking and philosophically stimulating, this is a film that invites multiple viewings, each revealing new facets of its layered construction.',\n",

       "  'Review': 'It\\'s a mess. But let\\'s start with the good things, some visual ideas are great, especially the \"colosseum\" sequence and most of statues or architectural related shots. That was it, the rest is messy and rushed. First of all, the purpose of this movie, feels like a collection of ideas on different topics as love, populism, the elites, injustice, police brutality, utopia, the future of humankind, the future of the US...etc. Now, I think that all the ideas Coppola collected have made it very complicated to dedicate enough time to actually any of them for them to be interesting and developed. Everything this movie shows seems \"childish\" and rushed, not one single idea is developed and uses time to explain itself. He basically introduces us to something new and then immediately goes on to the next topic, without letting the movie the time it would require to develop and to introduce questions it would later answer. This leaves us with a movie that is filled with ideas that feel undercooked and one end message that naively tries to answer to all the topics. Now, the most problematic thing about the use of time in this movie is that there are tons of characters that are useless to the story, dustin hoffman\\'s character is a joke, Cesar\\'s \"murdered\" wife is given quite much time on screen, but it feels like a waste of time. The rivalries in the movie seem very forced and that makes it tough to get interested in them. The actors at some points feel lost to, as if they did not really know if what they were doing made any sense. Not one single character is interesting because none are developed enough for it.To end all this, i\\'m sure that if Coppola had made this movie earlier it would have been much better, less messy and better written, I think at 85 years of age, one just wants to communicate everything learned, and that is how this movie feels, over 2 hour long depiction of ideas...what a shame, it could have been one of the best movies of the century !',\n",

He was brave to use a wide range of colors of the cinema and the public now punishes him for not being mediocre and mainstream.For me Megalopolis is an entertaining movie with great filming, acting filled with creativity, meaningfullnes and build a memory for Hollywood. We would need more edgy movies like this.',\n",

       "  'Review': \"When all is said and done I don't think Megalopolis is a good movie but I've never seen anything like it before so it justifies it's existence on those grounds alone. It's incoherent and honestly underwhelming after all the mystery that's been surrounding it for years now but I couldn't help but at least be in awe at what I was seeing but rarely for the right reasons.Like almost every aspect of this movie, the performances are all over the place but with this calibre of cast I couldn't help but get a kick out of seeing this level of acting talent be let completely of the leash. I think there are too many characters but at the very least the performances make them memorable even if it definitely produced some dire results. I've defended Shia LaBeouf in the past but he is insufferable here and, for lack of a better word, it's the most annoying performance I've seen in a long time. Thankfully no other cast members reach that low but despite a lot of impressive performances none of them ultimately feel like they're in the same movie.Obviously one of the big selling points of this movie is the fact that Coppola totally self financed it but it never really seemed like all that money appeared on screen. There's some very impressive visuals and unique production design but the VFX are awful to a baffling degree and I honestly found it to be a very cheap looking movie overall. The direction can be very messy, it's editing incoherent and the lighting just seemed off and it made certain scenes come across as amateurish. The scenes set in this utopia that Coppola is trying to establish clash with the scenes shot on location in New York and as a result I never really got immersed into this world.I don't know if I was ever totally onboard with what this movie was trying to do but for the first half I felt as if there was a story I could latch on to. It's messy from the get go but it had characters and concepts that intrigued me and to give Coppola credit I always wanted to see how things were going to conclude. But the last act went totally off the rails for me even compared with how outlandish the rest of the movie was. It didn't just become more messy it just stopped making sense. It's when the horrendous visual effects are on display the most and it just astounded me that filmmakers of this calibre thought anything about it worked.I don't think Megalopolis is a complete disaster or one of the worst movies ever made but I understand why anyone would walk out of this film with that mindset. It's admittedly unique but it barely feels coherent and I don't necessarily know what more could be discovered with repeat viewings. I'm always crying out for originality in movies and even if not much of it ultimately worked I can't help but feel glad that it exists.\",\n",

       "  'Review': 'The premise of the film is taking the concepts/characters of the Roman Empire and thrusting them into a futuristic Earth. The film is 138 minutes long. You wouldn\\'t want your worst enemy to sit through this entire film. It\\'s artistic diarrhea. So many unnecessary scenes bog down the film. No one asked to see Aubrey Plaza naked. So many love scenes that add minutes to the film. The film is really weird. Like think of the characters of the movie \"Grease\" (starring John Travolta) being thrust into a drama. Snapping their fingers and dancing for seemingly no reason (they actually do that in this film). It\\'s so out of place.The film is all over the place. The only thing I got from the film was trying to compare the \"politicians\" from the Roman Empire to people living today. That was the only fun thing while watching the film.Cesar Catilina = Elon Musk. A man bent on improving the lives of people on Earth through his genius & innovative thinking. Someone who is an unconventional genius (created an EV car company, a solar panel company, a company sending rockets into outer space, a company that bores tunnels for faster underground traveling).Clodio Pulcher = Hunter Biden. An absolute degenerate. Clodio is having intimate relationships with his cousins/aunts/etc. Hunter dated his dead brother\\'s wife after he passed away, and cheated on her with a \"lady of the night\" and got her pregnant (that actually happened. Check the news articles. Sigh... the Bidens).Wow Platinum = Kamala Harris. She\\'ll have intimate relationships with anyone in order to advance her career. Wow Platinum (Aubrey Plaza) hooks up with Hamilton Crassus III (Jon Voight... he\\'s like 85 years old). Kamala had a romantic relationship with Willy Brown when she was 28 years old and Willy was 60 years old. Willy was the Mayor of San Francisco. That\\'s how she started her career by using Willy. Just like Wow Platinum uses Hamilton Crassus. Both Wow/Kamala lie through their teeth. Only those gullible enough to believe them get used.Mayor Cicero = Eric Adams (Mayor of New York). I\\'m sure you\\'ve seen Eric Adams all over the news today for his corruption charges. Cesar Catilina calls Mayor Cicero a \"slum lord\". That\\'s exactly what Eric Adams has done to New York. Cesar Catilina\\'s argument is that politicians like Mayor Cicero keep people poor on purpose to keep them in power. Empty promises for a vote (vote for me and you\\'ll get all of your student loans abolished, a $25k housing loan on us, etc. All ear candy for a vote). Then none of those things that were promised get done, and the cycle of inner city mediocrity continues.That was the best part of the film to me because those comparisons are absolutely spot on and relates to what is happening right now in America. So if anything the film was relevant to show that our great empire can collapse quite easily, just like the Roman Empire. The characters of those times are alive today and seek power.',\n",

The biggest problem I had is the idea of a developer as hero, but the substance of it is good, the performances are great, the visuals are breathtaking. It's incisive and an incredible artistic act, knowing what Coppola put on the line to make it. There's never been a movie quite like this, and there probably never will be again.\",\n",

       "  'Review': 'After reading the feedback on this movie I decided to give it a chance because several were suggesting that perhaps some simply misunderstood it or arrogantly suggested that for some reason others simply didn\\'t have the intellect or taste to understand the true art that it is. With all this in mind I gave it every effort to see where Coppola is coming from.I understood the movie and all that is on display is a heaping hot waste of 120 million dollars. In this work I see that Coppola is trying to make 3 main statements: that America is headed on a destructive course like Rome, that if only we could identify the \"enlightened\" amoung us and essentially surrender our liberties to them we could reverse course, and that American culture itself is decaying and that the construction of this film proves it.Coppola clearly sees modern film as unsophisticated and lacking intellectual value. In making this he\\'s trying to wind back the clock. The problem is that he\\'s forgotten that film in the past actually had stories to tell and that there are essential components to doing so. The fix to modern film wasn\\'t to make a boring movie with scenes that don\\'t connect at all attached with quotes with no relevance to anything simply because they were stated by famous people of the past. The movie is presented like a student who writes an essay with dictionary words they don\\'t understand in order to come across as more intelligent than they truly are. The amount of money put into the optics of the movie is essentially the same as the student also adding a title page with glitter. It makes it more shiny but doesn\\'t add anything to the substance.As for its contents, the idea of there being some individual who could create a new utopian world if everyone would just give into their ideas is no new concept. In fact, those ideas have resulted in the deaths of millions in real life. Nevermind the fact that one of the new technological features of this new utopian world presented by Driver\\'s character is a fancy shining airport-like crosswalk? Nothing about Driver\\'s odd but apparently brilliant character is intriguing or really convincing even that he could create a better world.I think perhaps even more confusing is how he presents Driver\\'s annoying jealous cousin played by Laboeuf as the want to be dictator and main barrier to the new utopian world. While he certainly is an unbecoming character , the fact that without his existence that everything would just be sunshine and rainbows is ridiculous.They also present the current mayor as behind on the times and somewhat of a simpleton for not understanding Cesar Catalina\\'s (Driver\\'s) grand city plans. In my view he made the most sense in governing in the world as it was and not simply engaging in thought experiments. They also presented the people complaining about Cesar demolishing their homes to create his utopia as simply not understanding the bigger picture. Im not sure why even once they didn\\'t present Cesar as a villain, the man was ruining peoples lives and they had every right to hate him for it.Beyond issues with the actual story, the largest issue beyond anything else is simply that it is just so boring. The minutes of the film drag on and on and with almost no coherence between scenes. I couldn\\'t help but continuously check my watch. Several others were sighing and smacking there lips as if they were anxiously waiting to leave as well.Ive always thought it odd that people would ask for their money back simply because they didn\\'t like the movie they chose to go see.... Well I must say I felt robbed with this one.',\n",

       "  'Review': 'Writer-producer-director Francis Ford Coppola\\'s opulent but obvious sociological study of greed, murder, corruption, sexual manipulation (usually male-female, though there are some lesbian overtones early on), and power in the futuristic utopian city of New Rome (modeled after New York City). The mayor (Giancarlo Esposito ) clashes with Cesar, the Chairman of the Design Authority (Adam Driver) over a particular building material that can change the world. Meanwhile, the mayor\\'s daughter (Nathalie Emmanuel) has dropped out of med school and become involved in a tabloid scandal; she\\'s smitten with the architect after seeing him perform his super-power--stopping time--and takes a meeting with him (she has sent him a nasty letter and asks for it back in a replay from a scene in \"The Red Shoes\"). There\\'s also Cesar\\'s uncle (Jon Voight, perhaps doing a Donald Trump) who is the president of the bank; he marries a fame-hungry, gold-digging TV tabloid reporter who was involved with Cesar, goaded on by Cesar\\'s cousin (Shia LaBeouf) who has his nose in everybody\\'s business. The picture looks great, but only in snippets; the rest of the time, we\\'re stuck with these people who are a mostly boring lot (none more so than Driver, who continues to look like an abused Basset Hound). There\\'s a fancy effects collage near the end that really looks splendid, plus a finishing touch that is at once perplexing and amusing, but Coppola doesn\\'t have the knack any longer for interwoven character plots. \"Megalopolis\" is megalomania at its most expensive (reportedly $120M), but interest here will be from film students and Coppola-buffs, not from mainstream audiences. *1/2 from ****',\n",

From the opening shots, it feels like a true epic set in 2024 but with dialogue of the likes from the movies that cane before. I believe that the critics have utterly misunderstood the style acting and writing here. The acting is so similar to these great epics in the sense that they feel over the top and dreamy. The score intentionally uses big classic orchestras like what we heard in the overtures of the last epics. Every actor here hits their marks and plays the role needed for the film. I had some flashbacks to Apocalypse Now specifically with a car sequence towards the beginning of the movie.

       "  'Review': 'Francis Ford Coppola has created art, instead of following trends and making an easily marketable and digestible corporate product.In fact, seeing this multiple times, has been an exercise in therapy for me, a psychological solace from the dismal and declining society outside of the movie theater that celebrates and centers greed, lust, narcissism and anti-intellectualism.Our American republic is teetering on the brink-and we need artists and scientists and architects to remind us of the value of our humanity to flourish freely and expand possibilities for our collective future. Coppola\\'s magnum opus attacks the mediocrity that we have become conditioned to in every domain of our lives and as a society.Not a movie that will be celebrated by the majority of film critics who are typically employed by corporate America and connected to the Hollywood studio system-and who have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo of keeping the culture as low and stupid and vapid as possible.It dares to celebrate an intellectual as a hero in a way that is never dull, often funny and very provocative. We aren\\'t supposed to have heroes like this in mainstream movies-we also aren\\'t supposed to have characters and stories that play with ideas found in ancient and contemporary philosophy, theatre, architecture and art.The movie has some flaws sure-some of the dialogue is too on the nose-but I would hardly consider that mild criticism to be anything on the level of the attacks on this site and in many publications who have made tearing this movie down their MO.It is coherent-the story and plot does work-and there are some intentional ambiguities that are not meant to be answered which IS OK!\"Megalopolis\" is a daring masterpiece by a genius filmmaker. Coppola pulled off what every director alive from the Hollywood Renaissance would have dreamed of-making a movie on a grand scale without studio interference. In a potential future America where we have public financing of cinema, this wouldn\\'t be such an impossible and impressive feat. But this is America and corporations control cinema and thus they only want commodities that sell seats according to the cultural norms they have established.I have never seen a movie like this. It is a celebration of the human spirit-it is moving, funny, tragic, hopeful, beautiful in every way-it is a movie that can inspire the viewer to want to be better and to want their society-our society-to be better.\"Excellence is not an act, but a habit.\"\\n-Aristotle.',\n",

However despite all the passion Coppola clearly had for this film it turned out a complete mess. Adam Driver and Giancarlo Esposito do the best they can with the underdeveloped characters they are given, Aubrey Plaza and Shia LaBeouf both give awkward performances that seem like they come from a completely different movie, and Nathalie Emmanuel's line deliveries felt uninspired. The visual effects are pretty terrible, the music choices are very odd, and the sound design is so off that it's distracting. The green screen work is atrocious and the world building is so poor. We never get a real sense of what this world is. The character motivations are paper thin and they make so many stupid decisions that my theater was laughing at just how dumb these characters were. The script is a disaster. The film has the most over the top and annoying foreshadowing I have seen in a very long time and so many plot lines and characters are introduced and are seemingly important, just for them not to be. The main character also has powers that are never fully explored and by the end of the movie I wonder what the point of him having those powers even was. The film drags through its 2 hour and 20 minute run time but it still rushes the ending. The editing is very unique which I'll give it credit for, but it only actually works about half the time. Despite some nice shots every now and then you can tell that this film was directed by a Francis Ford Coppola in his eighties and not a Francis Ford Coppola in his prime.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"I got to see this movie for free as my friend works at a cinema. I say that because if I had to pay for this, my review would probably be more negative.I was laughing throughout this entire movie, at it. I've never quite had a so-bad-its-good movie experience like this, The Room might beat this movie honestly in that aspect.There were so many obvious greenscreens that looked just terrible, the entire background was blurred to the point of it being basically one color in some shots. The CGI was laughably bad, it looks identical to stuff you'd see in a Neil Breen movie. The dialogue was atrocious to the point where I was cackling at how cheesy it was, when it was trying to be incredibly deep.I actually sort of liked the worldbuilding that was going on, except for the fact that it was incomprehensible. If it was done well, New Rome could have been a pretty cool setting.I have so much I want to get across about this movie but I genuinely can't process it or put it into words.This is the beginning of a cult classic type fanbase, like Freddy Got Fingered or The Room or something like that. I was too young to join the cult fanbases those movies had when they first came out. I'm getting on the ground floor of a new cult classic with this movie. I love it. I'm still making myself laugh thinking about the bizzare dialogue in one scene near the end of this movie. I think I'm charmed by Megalopolis.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"Megalopolis is Coppola's redux of Metropolis, in the style of Citizen Kane's reminiscences (couldn't make it silent like Metropolis original obviously). But Coppola replaces the Protestant morality of Metropolis with something more apt of Howard Hughes.The complaints about the CGI in these other reviews are totally missing the point. It's in the style of a reminiscence. It's not supposed to look realistic, is supposed to look like a foggy memory, like in Kane, because the movie plays with the idea of time. We can't tell if the story is being watched or remembered, or even if it is in the future of the past or the present.The movie is set in modern-day New York, but also I'm the future, and simultaneously being Rome from the ancient past.The narrative is linear but skips ahead and slows down frequently.Caesar, the brilliant scientist, develops the ability to stop time, but he rarely uses it because he knows time must be lived and because it is ultimately irrelevant compared to the two great moral values of the movie: creative ambition and love.These morals are ultimately why so many people completely misunderstand the movie and the aesthetic. Megalopolis is a world without irony. The villains are falsely humble, scheming. The heroes are courageous, earnest, unsympathizing, and true. So is the language of the film, and this is why so many don't understand it. They can't get their heads out of the postmodern called where the only source of righteousness is victimhood. This itself is ironic, because the whole reason the movie plays with time is because these heroic values are timeless.If you can accept the heroic terms of the movie, everything makes sense, and it is beautiful.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"The Godfather films, Apocalypse Now, Bram Stoker's Dracula, The Outsiders, Rumble Fish all shared stroking production values, stunning design and cinematraphy, great emotional screenplays and some toweringly brilliant performances. But above all, YOU CARED about the characters and their plights. You were swept away by their stories, became lost in their worlds and wanted to know what happened to those people.Megalopolis is an incredibly ambitious idea, steeped in comment and observation about our current world and where it is going, striving for a sense of artistry and importance, but sadly - shatteringly, it simply doesn't work.Within the first ten minutes, the rapid fire editing and garish self-centred behaviour of the characters telegraphs a great director, whose famous works unfolded with an elegant character-driven pace, either struggling to adapt to modern speeds or - most likely - trying to use the modern vernacular to make his point. Either way, it feels messy.But this may not have mattered if the visuals worked - but they too often don't. There is a sense of grandeur (if you must see it, see it on the biggest screen you can) that is too often let down by unconvincing CGI, too often accompanied by a sense that there should be more people or action in the shot - that there is a budgetary constraints that prevent it reaching the scale and splendour of, say, a Ridley Scott film. Most of the characters are (probably necessarily) absolutely awful people - a few redeeming features would have helped. But over-archingly, too much of the acting is either at overblown scenery chewing level (Adam Driver, Shia Labeouf and others) or eye-wateringly incompetent and unconvincing (Nathalie Emmanuel - a monumentally terrible choice for a lead role, who seems to thing posing to look pretty is enough to convey character, emotion and complexity - and, sadly, Jon Voight). It's as if Mr Coppola just let everybody run rampant without his once, masterful direction and calibration of performance.It's a terrible shame because there is obviously something wonderful in here trying to get out. Occasionally it feels like it almost does. But the pieces are so mismanaged that - ironically for a film about a man that can control time to his advantage - it drags and, arduously, feels so much longer than its running time. In the end, probably mostly because of thegenerally appalling acting, it's biggest problem is that the viewer simply does not care about any of it.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"It has been a long time since I've seen a movie quite like this one. From beginning to end, I was completely captivated by its storytelling, themes, and characters. The film manages to balance entertainment with a deeper message, all while keeping the audience engaged without feeling too preachy. It was a wonderful experience, and I truly enjoyed every moment of it. The way it explores love, kindness, and society's more manipulative side was incredibly well done, and Francisco, the director, deserves high praise for his work. I'm so glad I didn't listen to the critics on this one.One of the strongest aspects of the movie is how it conveys a powerful message about humanity without being too overbearing. Instead of lecturing the audience, the film allows its story and characters to reveal the complexities of life, love, and human nature. The way it shows society's greed and manipulation is subtle but effective. It never feels like the movie is forcing a moral lesson on the audience, which is part of what makes it so compelling.The themes of love and kindness are central to the film and are portrayed in a way that feels authentic and moving. Whether it's romantic love, familial bonds, or the simple act of kindness between strangers, the film demonstrates how these elements can transform lives. The characters, while flawed, are depicted with such warmth and realism that it's easy to connect with them. There's an underlying message about the power of kindness in a world that can often be harsh and self-serving, and it's delivered beautifully through the characters' actions rather than their words.Francisco's direction is one of the film's biggest strengths. He has a unique ability to craft scenes that are both emotionally resonant and visually stunning. The pacing of the movie is perfect-there's never a dull moment, but it also gives the audience time to reflect on the deeper themes. The way he balances the emotional highs and lows of the film is masterful, making every scene feel purposeful and impactful. Francisco's vision for the film clearly shines through, and it's clear that he put a lot of care into making sure the story was told in the best possible way.The movie also does an excellent job of depicting the darker side of society, particularly how greed and manipulation can influence people's decisions. However, it does this without being too cynical or negative. There's always an underlying hope throughout the film, showing that love and kindness can triumph over these negative forces. The movie never loses sight of its core message-that in the end, it's the choices we make and the love we share that define us, not the greed or power we might pursue.What really stood out to me was how different my experience of the movie was compared to the opinions of some critics. I had heard mixed reviews, but I'm so glad I trusted my instincts and went to see the movie myself. It was a reminder that personal experiences with films can often differ from what the general consensus might be. This movie was truly an exceptional piece of work, and I'm glad I gave it a chance despite the criticism it received. Sometimes, it's worth making up your own mind, and this film is a perfect example of that.I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a meaningful and enjoyable cinematic experience. It's a film that not only entertains but also makes you think about the choices we make in life and the impact we have on others. With its thoughtful storytelling, excellent direction, and compelling characters, this movie is a must-see. I loved it, and I'm confident others will too. It's the kind of film that leaves a lasting impression, and I'm grateful to have experienced it firsthand.\",\n",

Manifesting a better world starts with us, and we have the power to change the course before it's too late.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"I'm sorry, I just saw this film and I'm utterly confused by its goal. It has beautiful set design and stunning camera work with random great moments, but that only constitutes about 20% of the film. It vacillates from work of art to Hollywood wokism to gratuities sex scenes that destroy the flow of the film. The film is LONG and will start to punish you after 30 mins. At the moment you need the film to end, the main character starts screaming nonsensical phrases in a loop. It's painful. The conclusion is trite. We have to chalk this up to a life long art project. Congrats Francis. You finally finish it after all this time.\",\n",

       "  'Review': 'Francis Ford Coppola\\'s \"Megalopolis\" has been sitting on my watchlist for a long time, and it\\'s been in development for an even longer time. Apparently, Francis started work on it in the 80s, and for a film that has had that much time to develop, and the fact of it being written and directed by the man of \"The Godfather\" trilogy, \"Apocalypse Now\", \"The Conversation\", and several other praised cinema classics, it left me severely disappointed.It succeeds visually with its stylish mix of Roman times and a modern metropolis, and it also has some good sets and special effects. You can go into it expecting a visual feast. The acting was good, but It has numerous stars, including Adam Driver, Shia Lebeouf, Jon Voight, and Dustin Hoffman. Considering how great these actors can be, them only being good in a movie isn\\'t that much of a compliment.Its substance has an equal amount of enjoyable and unenjoyable moments, and the whole tone and feel of the movie felt off and uneven at times. Sometimes it felt like watching a Terry Gilliam movie. Sometimes it felt like watching a Mark Neveldine movie. Sometimes it felt like watching \"Caligula\". Sometimes it felt like Coppola is doing and saying too much. Sometimes it felt like Coppola is doing and saying too little.Not only that, but at times it had so much going on that it left me feeling puzzled. (I still can\\'t make head nor tail of some of the story elements in it). It\\'s like a very messy spectacle of bewilderment.Overall, while I\\'m still glad I watched it, and I do think you should see it, \"Megalopolis\" is a very mixed bag of a movie. 5/10.Finally, if you disagree with some of the opinions stated here, that\\'s completely fine, and you are entitled to your own opinion.',\n",

       "  'Review': 'This movie loosely follows the structure of a historical Roman play (a Roman adaptation of Greek tragedies), projected against modern-day challenges of the U. S. political landscape. It also seems to allude to the film \"1984\" in some areas throughout the film. There are moments of debauchery (modern-day setting reflecting on the debauchery of Rome in the times leading up to its downfall). Quite an undertaking and despite throwing $125M of his own money in order to make this film, F. F. Coppola knew it would be a sunk cost with minimal return. I believe he didn\\'t care as the message of the film was more important to him rather than the money. He felt it was his duty to get this film out to the masses in the hope it will have a positive impact, with the message of \"hope\".There is an Act structure:\\n* Exposition - Introduces characters, setting, and the initial problem.* Complication - A problem arises, and tensions begin to build.* Climax - The turning point, where the main conflict reaches its peak.* Falling Action - The consequences of the climax start to unfold.* Denouement/Resolution - The resolution or downfall of characters.There are expressed Themes:\\n* Fate and Divine Will: In tragedies, the inevitable nature of fate and the gods\\' intervention is a common theme, especially in works influenced by Greek drama.* Conflict: Whether personal (internal struggles) or political (battles between powerful figures), conflict is central to the plays.* Moral Lessons: Roman plays often highlighted moral lessons or political commentary relevant to their society, sometimes glorifying Roman virtues like duty, honor, and patriotism.The film ends on the message of \"hope\", and that all bad can be overcome with the human will to find something better - the good in life of the next generation if you will - which becomes a little lost in the mix, but believe it is there.The acting: there are highlights of great acting from various actors throughout the film. There are points where (IMO) the acting just didn\\'t work and ALL actors/actresses had their highs and lows - NO EXCEPTIONS. The film rating was not a 10 as I subtracted 1 star for acting shortfalls, and 1 star for lack of clarity in some scenes.If you like to keep an open mind, watch, listen, think-through and process films, then this will be a good film for you to see and contemplate for hours if not days later.If you are not into Roman plays (Greek tragedies) with all the gore and debaucheries included, then this film is NOT for you. If you hate politics and the many nuances associated with it, this film is NOT for you. If you like films that are easy to understand and digest (Disney, MCU, DC, Horror), then this film is NOT for you.',\n",

Megalopolis isn't even 'fun bad' like other terrible movies that are at least a reasonably good time (e.g., 'The Room'). It is abundantly clear that the people in charge of this mess of a movie thoroughly enjoy the smell of their farts.The only reason this thing gets 2-stars is for the generally solid performances from several of the actors, and the interesting visuals (although some scenes look oddly low-quality).The dialogue is odd and, seemingly without logic, switches from somewhat 'normal' speech patterns to 'Shakespearian' poetry.The main character somehow has 'powers' but only uses them for some lame self-entertainment. His love interest has no discernible qualities other than being physically attractive and marginally curious.The best parts of the movie are the first ~45 seconds, when one of the main characters is shot in the face.\",\n",

With an R rating.In \"New Rome,\" a city with a lot of turmoil, a visionary artist, \"Cesar Catilina,\" played by Adam Driver with capabilities unlike anyone else, has a dream of a town unlike anything else. He isn\\'t corrupt like his family members \"Wow Platinum,\" played by Aubrey Plaza, and \"Clodio Pulcher,\" played by Shia LaBeouf. He\\'s not even like his grandfather, \"Hamilton Crassus III,\" played by Jon Voight, who finances the entire family.Then you have \"Mayor Cicero,\" played by Giancarlo Esposito, who is the mayor of New Rome. He is greedy and looks at things completely different than \"Cesar.\" \"Mayor Cicero\" can see his town is full of mayhem and destruction but is unwilling to do anything about it.His daughter \"Julia,\" played by Nathalie Emmanuel, is a party girl and uses her father\\'s power to do what she wants. It\\'s not until she takes an interest in \"Cesar\" that turns her whole way of life upside down.Now conflicted between staying loyal to her father and being with the man she loves. These powerful figures in her life will always have opposing viewpoints. You watch as \"Julia\" tries to deal with this divide along with the divide she feels internally.\"Megalopolis\" was Francis Ford Coppola\\'s last film. If you don\\'t know who Francis is, he made \"Apocalypse Now and \"The Godfather Trilogy.\" Amongst other notable films. I\\'ll let you know right now, this film isn\\'t that. It\\'s a far cry if I\\'m being honest.This took forty years to make. Yes, you read that right. It also cost over a hundred and fifty million dollars to make. Francis had to sell his wine cellar to help finance this film. He should\\'ve kept his wine, respectfully.Plagued with issue after issue. Too many to even name. From certain people, he chooses to cast to his treatment of the actors on set. Speaking of actors, who wasn\\'t in this film? The cast alone had to cost a pretty penny.This film was confusing, weird, and felt like an acid trip at times. I wasn\\'t feeling the graphics and cinematography. Francis fired the people doing the visual effects, and it showed. Watching this felt like a project I was forced to do on a subject I could care less about. It was boring at times and felt like a run-on sentence. I got the gems, I think Francis was trying to convey, but then again, who knows?It reminded me of the Leonardo DiCaprio film \"Romeo and Juliet.\" It had wacky moments and was odd at times. A lot was going on in this film. I will say it had a lot of great acting in it; they just had material that wasn\\'t the best.Unfortunately, this film didn\\'t do well at the box office. It had a lot going on in the film and surrounding it. I\\'m not surprised. I don\\'t mean to come off harsh, but it just wasn\\'t an enjoyable experience at all.

I did no research ahead of time and went in a blank slate about the story, just knowing the rumors that it was supposed to be bad.I could not get behind this. The relationship between the leads was completely unearned. They are adversaries and then, poof, they're in love and it's them against the world. Give me a break.I loved Giancarlo in Breaking Bad and was surprised to see such a poor performance. A few glints of brilliance, mostly mediocre, and a few scenes of outright bad acting. This, along with equally bad performances by many others is a direct indication of poor directing. How the mighty have fallen.The cavalcade of d-listers seemed never ending:\\nJon Voight? Really? Why?Laurence Fishburne? His major purpose was as a substitute Morgan Freeman to narrate the 8th grade philosophy essay-level voiceover drivel.Adam Driver. I don't see the appeal. He certainly had some cringeworthy acting moments in this thing. Embarrassing performance.Aubrey Plaza was fantastic in Parks and Rec and Ingrid Goes West. So, why was she so bad in this? It's got to come down to direction, right?I love Jason Schwartzman in the indie quirky roles he does. But again, a big boring bleh here.Dustin Hoffman didn't strain himself too hard in this role, but wasn't bad. He also wasn't utilized much and I wonder why he was in it at all.Shia Lebeouf. I don't care for him. He's been in a bunch of garbage movies like Transformers so I don't take him seriously at all. Imagine my surprise when I found him to be the best actor in this film. And not just by comparison to the bad performances by everyone listed above. He was actually good.The only other actor that I would say rose to the level of good was Kathryn Hunter. I don't know why she does so many god awful movies like this and Poor Things.Nathalie Emmanuel is another that loves to do terrible movies like Fast and Furious. I didn't mind her performance specifically, but she wasn't given a lot to do but be the love interest. It was fine, but not anything memorable.Overall, the movie was an inconsistent mess. From fantastical sets to cheesy, really bad green screen reminiscent of Sin City. Character moods, actions, and motivations seemed to change as needed to move the story along, without regard to if it made any sense. Melodrama at its worst.The on the nose nonsense about New Rome and characters named Caesar and Cicero, and quoting Marcus Aurelius, it was a very grade school sort of device. From that to the philosophy and tedious poetic language read by the tedious Mr. Fishburne, it all seemed like a very childish exploration of ideas, akin to stoners waxing serious about the meaning of life.$120,000,000 movie? How? It doesn't seem any grander than any other regular movie. That money absolutely did not end up on the screen.\",\n",

It's difficult to describe, and that may be the point.It's based on an ancient Roman event and treated like a modern day spin of an ancient Greek opera. It's packed with subtext from the obvious to the obscure. Comparing current day America to the Roman Empire right before its collapse is inspiring, like substituting Madison Square Garden for the Colosseum. It requires paying close attention and even then a lot of stuff doesn't seem to make much sense. It's not sloppy like a poorly made movie, but something purposely convoluted like an arthouse film. There's so much going on and so much that isn't explained or concluded, ultimately left to the audience to figure out.The cast is amazing. This is one of the most complex and dynamic roles Adam Driver has done, and he absolutely nails it. It's nice to see Giancarlo Esposito play someone other than the villain. Aubrey Plaza chews up the scenery. Shia LaBeouf disappears into the role. Talia Shire gives a touching performance.The film looks amazing. Stylized and not quite realistic. The scenes atop the clock high above the city are the best looking. Considering that Coppola hasn't done a special effects heavy movie before, he does an amazing job with it here.Ultimately, it's a movie that cannot be accurately described, only experienced. Like any piece of art, it will undoubtedly inspire discussion on its meaning and themes for a long time to come.\",\n",

I think if they'd just gone full commitment into a recreation of Rome in a modern or futuristic era it might have been interesting, like Baz Luhrmann's Romeo & Juliet or Ralph Fiennes' Coriolanus. I half started expecting Julius Ceasar in the future but was robbed. As for being futuristic, it barely even managed to be convincingly so.

       "  'Review': \"After decades of painstaking work and 120 million dollars of his own money, legendary director Francis Ford Coppola has released MEGALOPOLIS, his passion project. He wanted to tell a story about how societies and empires crumble, melding Roman inspirations with modern day New York, which is called New Rome in this. Cesar Catilina (Adam Driver) is an architect who invents a new building material that could change the city forever. Oh, and he has the inexplicable ability to stop time? The only thing standing in his way is mayor Franklyn Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito), who is very traditional. His daughter Julia Cicero (Nathalie Emmanuel) is smitten with Cesar, against her father's wishes. Aubrey Plaza plays a power-hungry anchorwoman literally called Wow Platinum. Shia LeBeouf plays Cesar's jealous and power-hungry cousin Clodio. Jon Voight plays Cesar's wealthy uncle Hamilton Crassus III, who seems drunk the whole time. Laurence Fishburne plays Fundi Ramone, Cesar's driver and the film's narrator. There are more characters, but they didn't really add to the plot or do anything memorable. This movie is tough to review. On the one hand, I feel happy that Coppola got this movie made, even though it was half of his life's work. On the other hand, some people are calling it MEGAFLOPOLIS, which is mean but accurate. On another hand, the look and visuals are breathtaking to see in the theatre. On a fourth(?) hand, it's a mishmash of ideas that don't go anywhere. I think cinephiles like myself have to see it. The rest of society probably won't go. MEGALOPOLIS is an abstract work of art that is open for interpretation, but the second half is a complete rushed mess. One man's passion project isn't always another man's treasure.\",\n",

He will receive a golden raspberry or, at best, a nomination for good costumes with decorations and sink into oblivion.It's a shame only for the director's personal funds, which were invested in the film. It would be better if he left it to his children.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"I just got out of Francis Ford Copplola's Megalopolis: A Fable.This is spoiler free. But outside of one thing, I couldn't even think of anything to spoil, if I tried.WOW!! This is not good. Okay. I didn't actually hate it, and the first 45 mins/hour is kind of intriguing enough, to keep you interested and it certainly has scope. But it completely falls apart.It does not explain things, it sets things up, just to abandon them, people who seem like key characters, are forgotten about, for long periods of time. It frustratingly jumps time periods on several occasions, with zero explanation and it's ending is not only non sensical, it is very unfulfilling and unsatisfactory.Has this movie been lost in the editing?? It's very incoherent. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a 4 hour cut out there.It all just felt like an exhausting, waste of time. I need to add, it felt a lot longer than it's 2hr 20 run time.It looks great at times and the cast do a fine enough job, especially given they have some ridiculous dialogue. Adam Driver was Adam Driver, Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad) is always reliable, Nathalie Emanuel (Game of Thrones) really stood out as a the leading lady. I need to say Aubrey Plaza is excellent here, as is Shia LaBeouf, who is amazing. Those three actors stole the movie for me. But what a waste of Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who are treated embarrassingly, but at least Voight was not a walk on like James Remer. I will say only only Plaza and LaBeouf seem to understand what movie they were in.So overall it is official, I dislike more Francis Ford Copplola movies than I like. I only like Outsiders, Godfather 2 The Conversation and The Rainmaker. I think Bram Stoker's Dracula is okay.I'm not sure why this has performed as poorly as it has (Did the trailer scandal or the FFC scandal turn people away). It's not the worst movie ever, it's not the worst movie this year, it's not the worst Francis Ford Copplola movie or even the worst Adam Driver movie. I think some people will like it, it just didn't work for me.It says at the bottom of the poster EXPERIENCE IT IN IMAX. That should have been on The Substance posters, which was much more of an experience at the cinema.I had the entire room to myself at the 13:30 showing. As I left, I was talking to a member of staff who said, there have been a few empty screenings.\",\n",

I left having slightly more understanding. I'm glad I didn't pay. I'm glad that I saw this movie on a second date with a very smart man, who also thought it was trash that made little sense. I'd like to say that I followed the plot. But the acting was so over the top, it felt like satire, or maybe a bad high school production. And that distracted from whatever they were trying to accomplish. The only positive comment I have is that the costume design for the dresses was spectacular. But I'm not sure what they were trying to accomplish with the high wasted pants on Adam Driver. This was not the piece of art I think they were hoping for. Art nouveau at it most insulting. It felt like they were trying to trick you into thinking it was smart. Terrible waste of time.My only takeaway from this movie was - even great actors make bad choices.\",\n",

       "  'Review': 'If Megalopolis is meant to represent utopia, why is it so jaundiced, cheap-looking, and unconditionally ugly? This is probably the most critical of the innumerable problems Francis Ford Coppola faced in making his long gestated, self-funded and erratically paced 2024 film that could be his last statement as a filmmaker. There is no question his talent is still evident at random points here. At 85, he\\'s a visionary based on his half-century-old masterworks, but his perspective is unfocused and incoherent with no logical throughput to the narrative and no apparent guidance given to the actors who give wildly inconsistent performances. Set in an alternate universe where \"New Rome\" takes the place of New York City, the Shakespearean plot centers on Cesar Catilina, a brilliant albeit self-absorbed architect who has the inexplicable ability to stop time. He has also created a new building material called Megalon, the basis of his redesign of New Rome into a humane utopia called Megalopolis. He has an enemy in the city\\'s mayor, Franklyn Cicero, and complicating matters between them is Cicero\\'s daughter Julia. There are a multitude of other characters involved in this convoluted tug-of-war, though the variability of the actors\\' performances can be frustrating. Adam Driver\\'s agitated screen persona has become tiresome as he tackles Cesar. There are strong influences from Ayn Rand\\'s \"The Fountainhead\" and \"Atlas Shrugged\", but the iconoclastic nature of those stories is beyond Driver\\'s grasp. Aubrey Plaza is dryly funny as an opportunistic reporter aptly named Wow Platinum, and Shia LaBeouf has some out-there moments as Cesar\\'s jealous cousin Clodio. The problem is that they looked to be acting in a pointed satire that otherwise doesn\\'t exist in the story. Casting cancelled actors like LaBeouf and Jon Voight as a multi-billionaire industrialist is more distracting than effective, and Laurence Fishburne is wasted as both narrator and Cesar\\'s driver. It\\'s a mess that cost Coppola $120 million and a huge chunk of his wine business, but you have to admire a man willing to sacrifice so much for his art no matter how abysmal the results are.',\n",

But the film's overall aesthetic is surprising and, despite the sometimes abrupt editing and sloppy segues, you quickly get into the atmosphere of the film.A lot of themes are tackled, but, probably due to lack of time, they're often skimmed over: Manipulation of the people by power-seeking politicians, Fighting for his convictions despite all opposition, plots orchestrated to bring someone down, open criticism of the elite and the powerful.Several moments are a bit long-winded, despite the well-paced, philosophically accessible dialogues. Certain aspects of the film are unnecessary and a little too far-fetched for my taste, such as the power over time which, even if intriguing, doesn't add much because it's neither explained nor used at key moments in the character's life...\\nIn short, a surprising film, a fine cinematic experience which I personally enjoyed, but which will undoubtedly not be to everyone's taste.\",\n",

If he had taken the story he is trying to tell seriously, he wouldn't have made this film. It is a vanity project he had to finance himself that brought in big name actors who were afraid this would be their last chance to be in a Coppola film.A confusing, poor story, trite dialogue, and moments of serious overacting, makes me hope that Coppola has one more film in him so this isn't his final film when he dies. Lifting lines from Shakespear, Marcus Aurelius and Plutarch does not add veritas or make the story and dialog any better.The only thing Megalopolis has going for it is its cinematography.

It is said to be an allegory relating our era to that of the Roman Empire, but instead it is a confused salad of content and important and profound sounding speeches with no actual depth to them.Adam driver is an odd choice, but surprisingly he delivers a descent performance to a ludicrous role. Neither of the supporting actors including Dustin Hoffman and Aubery Plaza, manage to save this sinking ship.At some points the film is so ludicrous that a rumble of snickering laughter can be heard through the audience, and not in scenes that were supposed to be humorous.To me it was highly disappointing. I can't understand what was going through this great director's head.The message of optimism about technology as the salvation of humanity and society at large also clings hollow.

At first, it actually sounds promising, especially with Adam Driver's character having the power to stop time. As the film goes on, it's more some meandering journey that never quite delivers on its promise. Reaching for some big ideas in politics, utopia, and clashing ideologies, it doesn't quite pull off the execution. It's a dragging plot that takes too long to deliver its themes, and by then, one feels underwhelmed and unsatisfied.Despite its high aspirations, Megalopolis feels more like the assortment of half-baked ideas rather than a coherent narrative. The movie deals with political messages, almost touching on the idea that one cannot reach a utopia because of our inability to change our political mindsets. However, at no point is this message ever really developed. The cast is passable enough given what they are provided to work with, though it does seem a shame that their talents were somewhat squandered in a film.Eventually, Megalopolis comes off as the kind of film that is arguably better served as a background watch rather than something one should truly engage with in theaters. While its core theme is interesting, the film never really manages to build a compelling story around it. If anything, this really felt like something that might have worked better as a book or podcast, wherein such ideas could be explored with greater depth and thought, but In the end It just failed.\",\n",

       "  'Review': 'I can only hope that my reputation among fellow online moviegoers isn\\'t that of a fanboy or an overemotional child, especially considering that there are some directors, such as Coppola, are extremely dear to my heart. I could go on about how one of my favorites, Don Bluth, only has one movie I\\'d give five-stars and try to use that as proof of something, but I want to make it perfectly clear: I am willing to criticize hit movies. I am willing to compliment bad movies. I say this all because Megalopolis has been the ONE movie I\\'ve been more excited about for years. I have been prepared for the idea that this could be his masterpiece or a total disaster. I\\'ve heard much of the commentary regarding this controversial CGI art gallery. And now that I\\'ve seen it, I\\'m ready to write my review, flesh out my final thoughts and come to a consensus.Having already seen the gloriously ambitious surrealist film, The Holy Mountain, I felt that I was fully prepared for anything, be it conventional or experimental. I went into the theater with a very specific mindset: see if symbolism is telling the story. And why? Because I\\'ve heard about how confusing the visuals make it, and I wanted to see if that\\'s what Coppola was trying to achieve. And I left the theater thinking, \"What the hell were they talking about? I\\'m following this story just fine. The symbolism only has a say in a few scenes.\" I mean, seriously. This is what it is: a few powerful people are arguing about the fate of their city while dealing with personal problems. Easy. You could make a sitcom out of that premise. I even felt that way a half-hour in during the circus scene.But then it hit me. The circus scene was showing these people dancing around with excellent choreography while you heard Cesar\\'s philosophical ramblings meant you had to try and focus on two different things, right? But both were being shoved in your face, so which takes the front lines? THAT WAS IT. There were no front lines. This creative manifesto (as Rotten Tomatoes calls it) is actually a challenge to us. It was testing the audience and which of the two we would pay attention to, or at least that was my theory. Now I was already used to the idea of being amazed by the visuals, having seen many of the trailers. I went into it ready to try and put together a story, but it was so easy that in the end I decided to focus on the philosophy instead.So this movie is a modern day take on Ancient Rome, and why? Obviously, like Babylon, it\\'s comparing our current behavior to the behavior of a sinful time. So how does this play into the philosophy and the visuals combining into one? Well, Coppola\\'s been making semi-autobiographical movies about his philosophies toward filmmaking, so it seemed to make perfect sense: Coppola is TRYING to distract most people from the story by flooding us with visuals, but is also trying to see if we can put together the philosophies and follow along with the varying takes on humanity\\'s duty to society, and there are plenty of those and quite a bit of character development here. The fact that the characters are at least fairly engrossing seems to justify that, especially when the casting is high-bar.So this is my theory: Coppola is testing us. If we\\'re able to follow along with the philosophies, we\\'re real moviegoers and we\\'re looking for a deeper meaning in things, which means we\\'re a lot like Cesar wants to be. If we\\'re distracted by visuals (whether enjoyed or not), then we\\'re as shallow as the highfalutin millionaires spending their money on wine, women and song. Cesar himself criticized that behavior and aimed for a society where people are growing. In other words, if we see more than that in Megalopolis, we are the future. If not, then we\\'re shallow. This is a bit egotistical for the mighty Coppola, but whatevs. If the Redditers are gonna praise Ridley Scott for calling his own Blade Runner one of the greatest movies of all time, then this little one-twenty-mill stunt from Francis\\' own pocket, assuming my theory is true, should be fine. He HAS already made movies about his rejection for what we all think. In fact, one can even say that Coppola might be taking that philosophy a step further by not only rejecting us, but turning our praise and disdain back on us by having the movie dissect us while we\\'re dissecting the movie. All of this in a simple story about a fight for power among a few parties.Now that I\\'m done with my theory, let\\'s get into the technical stuff. The visuals are undoubtedly some of the greatest, if not THE greatest, ever seen in the modern age. There are surrealist paintings involved here that morph into sensations only before captured in a few instances by The Life of Pi. In fact, the dream city of Megalopolis takes my beloved Chocolate Room and shows the hot iron stirring rod up its ass. Even as I was focusing on the story, I remained impressed by the visuals. While I didn\\'t know exactly what visuals I would get through the two-hour whole, I knew what to expect, allowing my surprises among the visuals to be perfectly tame.As for the story, I liked it. This glorious cast of characters was not only fun to watch for two reasons going hand in hand: the acting was spot-on through and through, and the philosophies and conversations (addressed as the mark of bravery and controversy) were realistic and somewhat fun to hear because of the realism, even though a little pretentiousness could be sensed along the way. This helped the story and the themes to progress naturally and more easily that what the average moviegoer may let on. So do the visuals offer a distraction? Can I negatively compare this more coherent film to The Tree of Life? So far, I\\'m not really thinking so. But there are a couple things I need to address. First of all, this movie\\'s introducing art film behavior to the CGI masses, and normalizing CGI to the type who use the word \"auteur.\" This is an exceptionally bold move. Secondly, it can be said that there isn\\'t ENOUGH time travel, but we got exactly what we needed from the time travel\\'s presence in the movie as far as developing the story goes, so once again this is a movie that goes beyond expectations for thematic reasons. Thirdly, the philosophical quotes need a little more coherency, but that\\'s about it.All in all, I have to say that the biggest flaw of this movie is really how innovative it is. This is a challenge that I think succeeds at the thematic in the long run, and manages to tell its story perfectly well despite it amazing visuals, so those who get distracted from the story really just aren\\'t paying attention. They often go hand-in-hand, sometimes on a symbolic level bordering on the psychological. This is some very fine filmmaking from Coppola. This is a level of bombast that succeeds in technicality, base but characterized storytelling, some symbolism and heavy social philosophies. Personally, as a Coppola fan, I am quite satisfied with my current consensus. However, this movie is likely going to be dissected until the end up time. I could be totally wrong on a couple things, and am willing to accept that outcome. This movie might be hated by half the world now, but Coppola just might be right. The acting, visuals, and ease of storytelling warrant plenty of replay value, and two hours and twenty minutes really isn\\'t THAT long anymore. There\\'s every reason to want to go back to this, and because of that, more discussions about the film and its OWN future may rise, and eventually, more about society and OUR own future may rise as well. So forgive me for being a Coppola fanboy who happens to praise this film, but I must be honest as I am analytical, and I hope I was able to prove that.',\n",

It's a complete FLOP, BUT...Let us remember what made director Francis Ford Coppola one of the greatest American directors that has ever lived. Because this man was solely responsible for 3 movies that shook the entire movie world, in and outside of America.The Godfather (1972).The Godfather Part II (1974)Apocalypse Now (1979)BRAVO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!In between he made a brillaint paranoia thriller with Gene Hackman (The Conversation in 1974). These are all movies that belong to the cinematic treasure cove of American movie classics.If (by some chance of being very young) you havent yet seen one of the above movies, then treat yourself to the absolute spectacle of watching one these all time great American movie classics...\",\n",

       " {'Review Summary': '\"Cinema is Something Alive and Ever-Changing\"',\n",
       "  'Review': 'Winner of 5 Academy Awards and the man behind the legendary \"Godfather\" trilogy, Francis Ford Coppola, returns to cinema with a passion project that has been in the making for decades. After early screenings at festivals, some viewers described the film as a groundbreaking masterpiece, while many others called it an outright disaster and one of the worst films they had ever seen in a theater. All of this, of course, was enough to intrigue me to watch the film in IMAX on opening day. While the film is far from being bad, it\\'s also hard to go to the other extreme and call it a masterpiece. Nonetheless, it offers a unique cinematic experience that feels somewhat like cinema from the future, and in my opinion, it\\'s highly recommended to experience it on the big screen.Coppola has dreamed of making \"Megalopolis\" for decades-since the 1980s, in fact. He began early production in the early 2000s and even managed to shoot some footage in New York, but the project was shelved after the 9/11 attacks, which made the film\\'s themes and certain parts of the original script feel sensitive and in very poor taste for the time. In the years that followed, he struggled to secure funding for the project while maintaining his (ambitious, in his view) vision for it, and only in the 2020s, with renewed backing from studios and a significant amount of his own financial investment, was he able to revive the project. The new version of the script was aimed at an independent production on a massive scale, reflecting Coppola\\'s ideas about society, politics, and art, while attempting to make boundary-breaking cinema-something that hadn\\'t been done before.A quick glance at the film\\'s rating histogram on the Letterboxd site (as of now) shows that Coppola managed to create something truly exceptional with this project. I can\\'t remember the last time I encountered such a distribution of ratings for a film, with nearly every possible rating receiving almost equal numbers of votes. It\\'s a rare case of a film where its early viewers couldn\\'t reach any consensus at all, with reactions ranging across the spectrum from colossal disaster to a one-time masterpiece-and everything in between. It feels like an ideal distribution for a film whose primary goal is to make viewers raise an eyebrow and think outside the box.\"The movies your grandchildren will make are not going to be like this formula happening now. We can\\'t even imagine what it\\'s going to be, and that\\'s the wonderful thing about it. The notion that there\\'s a set of rules to make a film - you have to have this, you have to have that - that\\'s OK if you\\'re making Coca-Cola because you want to know that you\\'re going to be able to sell it without risk. But cinema is not Coca-Cola. Cinema is something alive and ever-changing.\" - Francis Ford CoppolaPersonally, I\\'m a big fan of unconventional storytelling. Cinema has existed for decades, and following predefined patterns of how a movie \"should\" look and how a story \"ought\" to be written has been done in countless films. While this approach certainly works well in the context of many movies (after all, there\\'s a reason it\\'s become the norm), I feel it\\'s long past being necessary, and any departure from this formula is intriguing and even most welcome. It seems Coppola came to the film with exactly this mindset, and the technical and visual aspects certainly delivered the goods, offering a one-of-a-kind cinematic experience. However, in terms of plot and screenplay, the film falls short, which left me somewhat disappointed.Anyone looking for a coherent and well-written story has come to the wrong place. While the film\\'s plot isn\\'t bad, it plays a secondary role to technical aspects like visuals, editing, music, and so on-or in a broader sense, the experience of watching it. Personally, I felt a lack of world-building that would explain some of the elements presented in the film as if they were self-evident, and many times the story felt quite messy. Additionally, while the plot builds reasonably well in the first two acts of the film, it feels like the third act rushes to close the story in a way that seems a bit lacking and too hasty.As criticized a lot regarding the movie, it deals with tons of themes and subjects, and it seems like Coppola had a strong statement to say in all of these subjects. While succeeding in some, the message again falls short in most of them and it feels like more polishing to the script, and even an additional running time would have helped tremendously.The film boasts an impressive cast filled with great actors and big names, which seems unnecessary to go through one by one since, as an ensemble, they did an excellent job and matched their performances to the film\\'s theatrical and fable-y style. In terms of direction, not much needs to be said-this is Francis Ford Coppola, after all, and you can clearly see the work of a professional here.But if we focus on the \"experience\" aspect-the film does an amazing job, and just for that, I would highly recommend watching it, especially in an IMAX theater. The cinematography is among the most impressive I\\'ve seen this year, the editing is dynamic and excellent, the musical choices and their use are perfect, and overall, Coppola managed to make 140 minutes fly by with great enjoyment, delivering a unique and impressive cinematic display.It\\'s hard to ignore the negative buzz surrounding the film on social media, but in my personal opinion, it\\'s worth seeing it and judging for yourself. It\\'s definitely not a film for everyone, but as I mentioned, it offers a unique cinematic experience and is a very unusual movie-in the best possible way (in my personal view). The movie has many flaws, but as an overall ambitious experience it definitely delivers. Without a doubt, it\\'s a film I can see myself going to watch again soon, as there\\'s a lot to digest and analyze here and because it was just so much fun.',\n",

       " {'Review Summary': 'Coppola is too old now',\n",
       "  'Review': 'Megalopolis\" is a film that dives into the depths of ambition, both in its narrative and in its creation, but it\\'s a journey that feels more like a meandering stroll through the mind of its director, Francis Ford Coppola, rather than a coherent cinematic experience.The Ambition is Palpable: There\\'s no denying that Coppola\\'s vision for \"Megalopolis\" is grand. Drawing parallels between ancient Rome and modern-day New York, the film attempts to explore themes of utopian ideals clashing with entrenched power structures. This ambitious narrative could have been groundbreaking, but it often feels like the film is trying to do too much, resulting in a sprawl that lacks focus.Visual Feast with a Side of Chaos: Visually, \"Megalopolis\" doesn\\'t disappoint. From the futuristic sets to the imaginative blend of classical and modern architecture, there\\'s a lot to feast your eyes on. However, this visual spectacle sometimes feels disconnected from the story, as if the visuals are there for their own sake rather than to serve the plot. The chaos in the visuals mirrors the thematic chaos, which might be intentional but doesn\\'t always make for a satisfying narrative experience.Character Depth or Lack Thereof: The characters in \"Megalopolis\" are intriguing in concept but fall flat in execution. Adam Driver\\'s Cesar Catilina, for instance, should have been the epicenter of emotional and ideological conflict, but his character, like many others, remains somewhat at arm\\'s length. The dialogue, intended to be profound, often veers into the pretentious, making it hard for the audience to connect with or care about the characters\\' fates.Narrative Overload: \"Megalopolis\" feels like it\\'s trying to tackle the entirety of human civilization\\'s issues in one fell swoop. While this could be seen as bold, it also results in narrative overload. Subplots and themes are introduced only to be half-explored, leaving the viewer with a sense of narrative whiplash rather than a cohesive story.The Verdict: \"Megalopolis\" is for those who appreciate the attempt at grand, philosophical cinema even when it misses the mark. It\\'s not a bad film per se, but it\\'s one that might leave you pondering more about what it could have been rather than what it actually is. Coppola\\'s heart and passion are on the screen, but perhaps spread too thin across too many ideas. For its ambition and visual flair, it earns a 4 out of 10-a nod to what it aimed to be, even if it didn\\'t fully get there.',\n",

There are bits and pieces of Trump in the film but then there are contradictions as well - the non-Trump. So if it falls flat on Fellini it also falls flat on Political.Ah, but that's not all. The acting is terrible. Adam Driver, not known for great acting, is at his very worst. Completely wasted are Fishburrne, Shire, Hoffman, Remar, and Sweeney.

It was hard to even follow the basic plot with all the unneccessary drivels and wannabe psychodelic atmosphere. And so so many unneccessary scenes, adding nothing to the experience.

Not that Francis Ford Coppola's strange and stylistic Megalopolis is amongst the filmmakers' best, but there is enough brewing beneath the surface to warrant a watch. Meaning his stark visuals and apt influences that stand out do butt heads with both an overblown amount of themes and a serious case of underdeveloped characters. On the one side to simply dismiss the film as an failing and overindulgent passion project would be too easy, but on the other to call it a masterwork highly untrue. The truth of Megalopolis is that the answer, much like the opinion of the films' varying and divisive audience, lies somewhere in the middle.\",\n",

I\\'m at a genuine loss here if I\\'m honest, it\\'s surely going to be the most divisive film of the year, visually insane but complete and utter nonsense. The dialogue and acting are heightened, skewed and bizarre, lurching from fascinating philosophical arguments to nonsense rhymes and non-jokes, even stopping dead to give us two musical numbers in quick succession. It seems unrealised even in its unlikely realisation. A frustrating yet enthralling dive into Coppola\\'s vision of what film and - by extension, life itself - are, have been and could be. A bold portrait of humanity in all of its paradox.

He has lived an entire lifetime, had soaring triumphs and crushing failures. His talents propelled him to international notoriety, and as such, he has probably experienced more in one lifetime than many people ever will.

It was a profound experience that left me feeling optimistic and almost shaken at the same time. I found myself just sitting there after the five or six other audience members exited, and once I collected myself, I felt like I was stumblng out.

       "  'Review': \"From what I'm assuming is his first future length film, this Coppola fellow has quite a bit of learning to do if he's hoping to ever make it in Hollywood. I'm sure he'll figure things out once he gets some real experience under his belt.IMDb wants more characters so I can expand on what I liked and didn't like.Some of the visuals were great, although they would probably work better in the context of a music video. Maybe that's where he got his experience. If I was looking to find a director for a big budget music video, I would hire him in a heartbeat.The cast is excellent on paper but it didn't translate. I hated the monologues and the dialog in general. Way too much exposition and awkward acting. They must have filmed on green screen sets in different locations because the conversations were very disjointed and lacked chemistry.I was surprised to see Shia Lebouf in this and he was probably the only character I enjoyed watching.Okay I reached the limit.

       "  'Review': 'A brilliant architect (Adam Driver) is determined to recreate a core section of New Rome in the later 21st century with a revolutionary bio-adaptive material called Megalon. But the new mayor resists these creative plans because he\\'s content with the way things are (Giancarlo Esposito). As such, the mayor\\'s not happy when his daughter (Nathalie Emmanuel) starts to develop a relationship with the prodigy. Shia LaBeouf plays a decadent troublemaker while Aubrey Plaza appears as a scheming TV presenter drawn to the financial backbone of the city (Jon Voight).Francis Ford Coppola first came up with the idea for \"Megalopolis\" in 1977. It was inspired by Lucius Sergius Catiline\\'s failed attempt to take control of the Roman republic in 63 BC, but lost to his rival Marcus Tullius Cicero. Even though Francis compiled hundreds of pages of notes and script fragments for the project in early 1983, the first serious attempt to go forward with making the movie was in 2001-2002, but the production eventually froze for various reasons, including the 9/11 terrorist attacks.When Coppola turned 80, he decided to throw caution to the wind and finally make the film, financing it himself at a cost of $120 million, with shooting taking place between November and March, 2022-2023. So, is it any good? Some critics call it a \"big mess,\" but the plot is actually simple, as detailed above. It\\'s Francis\\' artsy style that throws people off wherein he respects the intelligence of the viewer to put the pieces together. This approach was evident in his previous pictures, like \"One From the Heart,\" \"Rumble Fish,\" \"Bram Stoker\\'s Dracula,\" \"Youth Without Youth\" and \"Twixt\" (aka \"B-Twixt Now and Sunrise\"). Speaking of those flicks, if you liked any of them, or hated \\'em, this is cut from the same artistic cloth.As observed with \"Tucker: The Man and His Dream,\" \"Tetro\" and even \"Apocalypse Now\" (the character of Kurtz), Coppola likes to parallel aspects of his own life in his movies. Here, he\\'s Cicero (Driver), an award-winning genius who has an ambitious new project that will revolutionize the landscape if carried out, but those in power oppose his noble efforts. He\\'s constantly slandered or framed with his indiscretions not helping matters. He\\'s also troubled by the death of his wife and his unborn children (remember the tragedy of Francis\\' eldest son, Gian-Carlo, in 1986?). Yet he presses on with his vision and ultimately changes the world with his art.At the end of the day, the movie\\'s entertaining on several fronts and stuffed with quality mindfood, not to mention it has a welcome warmhearted close. I busted out laughing on several occasions in light of the creative madness of it all. For those who say the amusement was \"unintentional,\" I guess they never saw Coppola\\'s previous film \"Twixt,\" not to mention earlier ones like \"You\\'re a Big Boy Now.\"I see the city of Megalopolis as a type of the New Jerusalem in the Bible, the eternal city described in Revelation 21-22 (awesome streets of gold and all that). \"The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life\" and so the impenitent in the movie reap the wages of their transgressions whereas those who change their minds/thinking/actions (that is, they repent) are able to enjoy the benefits of the amazing new city.If you value it, this is a flick you\\'ll be able to go back to for gems missed on previous viewings.It runs 2 hour, 18 minutes, and was shot in Manhattan and Trilith Studios, Atlanta.GRADE: B+/A-',\n",

       " {'Review Summary': 'Demands you pay attention to each scene',\n",
       "  'Review': 'Francis Ford Coppola\\'s Megalopolis: A Fable, is a film that demands you pay attention to every scene including the nuances that accompany each. It doesn\\'t simply break the fourth wall, it ignores it completely. It is also, based on comments that Coppola shared with audiences in his exclusive, live-streamed Q&A held before the film, semi-autobiographical. Not in the sense that Coppola is an architect of buildings, but more in the sense that Coppola takes chances, constructing self-financed, extremely costly productions that major studios are afraid to touch because they are risky investments. Coppola vision paid off with Apocalypse Now, his 1979 self-financed explosive saga that merged Conrad\\'s Heart of Darkness with the Vietnam War, receiving eight Oscar nominations and taking home two statuettes. And it might pay off for Megalopolis as well, Coppola\\'s love-child that took 30 years to birth.And just a note, before the review. Coppola told the audience that he initially rejected directing Godfather 2. He didn\\'t believe in repeating himself. He wanted his NY compadre, Martin Scorsese, to direct the second Puzo film. The studio asked Coppola \"how much would it take for you to direct\"? Coppola said, \"A million. Plus full control. Plus it has to be called Godfather 2\". The studio agreed to the first two terms; then came to accept the third. Coppola therefore blames himself \\'for every numbered film that came after\\'.Now, the review.Using light in an intriguing way, with visual special effects including the sliding of triptych panels throughout, Coppola\\'s plot is clearly an optimistic vision for the future. Though visually set in late-20th century NYC, it overlays the intrigues of ancient Rome prior to the epic fall of their Empire. This Manhattan is filled with the same debauchery as revealed in Roman history, the plotting, the Circus and, especially, the money and the corruption. The plotters revel in their golden excess. The scales of Justice herself have become too unbalanced; she is exhausted with the unending inequity between rich and poor, In an animated sequence, she and other carved Roman marble statues and facades are seen slipping off their Wall Street perches. This apple is definitely rotten to the core.Within this dark Manhattan, a Nobel-prize winning architect has a brighter vision for the future. He believes New York City should be light and ethereal, to better serve all the residents, not just cater to the top one percent. The architect, Cesar Catilina, is played by Adam Driver, who is captivating in this role.The film, set in \\'New Rome, 3rd Millenium, 21st Century\\', opens with an exterior shot of Grand Central Station and walks us into the crown of the Chrysler Building, where Catilina lives and works. The Mayor of New Rome, and Catilina\\'s foe, is Franklyn Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito). Cicero is committed to perpetuating the ugliness of society as it currently exists, a society which only enhances the fortunes of himself and his cronies.At a public unveiling of a city project, the flamboyant, cloak- sweeping Catilina catches the eye of Cicero\\'s daughter, the smart, educated, young, well-spoken beauty Julia (Nathalie Emmanuel). She feels Cicero\\'s passion for his projects and is captivated by it, and, eventually, by the architect himself.Architect Cicero is the nephew of Hamilton Crassus III (Jon Voight), the wealthiest man in the world. Cicero\\'s cousin, Clodio Pulcher (Shia LaBeouf), lusts after Julia, who continually spurns his crazed advances. You can see where this is leading. There will be passion. There will be envy. There will be blood.In addition to these very Shakespearean themes, including multiple quotes and soliloquies from The Bard sprinkled throughout, there is also the concept of time, weaving its way throughout Megalopolis. The sands in an hourglass. Time is running out. Cicero can actually make time stand still, with just a word, or the snap of his fingers. Yes, it\\'s definitely a bit of visual sci-fi, but it adds to the myth of the man. No one else knows he has this power because when he uses it, all life is stopped - until Julia sees the magic happen with her own eyes.Another standout character is Aubrey Plaza as Wow Platinum. She\\'s the gold-digging fulcrum in this saga, and her scheming sets in motion the fall, and rise, of various players. As a reporter determined to permanently tie her \\'Money Bunny\\' fluffy tail to one of the city\\'s men of influence, she\\'s a Catherine deMedici of Megalopolis, scheming against all who block her need for power and influence. Women don\\'t have much of a voice in this city, being relegated to Vestal Virgins or wives, and Wow is determined to grab the brass ring while she can.Not only is New Rome being threatened with destruction from within by the clutches of these connivers, but the sky above is literally falling. A rogue satellite has fallen out of orbit and will be crashing to earth... somewhere. Also, when\\'s the last time you heard \\'string theory\\' mentioned in a film? You\\'ll find it, here in Megalopolis. BTW, in the film, Megalon is the material that Catilina is using to build his utoptian city. The use of Megalon gives one the ability to control space and time, which explains Catilina\\'s secret power.The characters in the film are all completely ego-driven, each believing they have the best plan for the people, the best plan for the future, whether they are politicians or architects. Even though he conceived of the idea 30 years ago, Coppola commented that the events in this film mirror the current political morass in which the U. S. finds itself. His Megalopolis a sweeping, highly conceptual, visually striking exploration of love, time and T-squares.',\n",

       "  'Review': \"I do believe that this wildly creative, intellectual and consciousness-expanding film will be seen to be a classic in the years to come.Coppola has created a fantastic Gotham world with heightened actions, emotions and words, that allows for the classic fight of good vs. Evil, fear vs. Love, and separation vs. Unity to be put on mythic display.Yes, this allows for over-the-top characters like Aubrey Plaza as Wow Platinum and Shia LaBeouf as Clodio that seem cartoonish at times, but the grand gestures of the focus on money, sex. Looks, and worldly success are exactly the motivations of the old world that Coppola is criticizing - if they are in a soap opera, it is because the world, in this vibration, tends to operate as one, where vengeance, revenge, jealousy and ownership are the drivers to meaning in life. If movies like Batman, in its Gotham city, can have outsize characters, why can't Megalopolis?And the higher vibration and consciousness being brought into the planet by Cesar (Adam Driver) and Julia Cicero (Nathalie Emmanuel) focused on love, equity, peace, harmony, creativity is powered by the mythic building substance that Cesar has discovered and won the Nobel prize for that is alive, generates light, regenerates the body like stem cells, and allows for time to be stopped and reality to be re-created into a world that is flowing in unity, harmony and love.That Adam is almost finished and loses his powers without the appearance of Julia in his life is a nod by Coppola to the Twin Flame power of two souls in harmony, when they come together, are even more powerful than individually.Coppola not only puts forward a vision, a dream for a better world, but allows for the fantastic building materials to be a metaphor for working with energy and LOVE and LIGHT from a higher consciousness perspective to create whatever we desire. We are the creators of our reality, and we can create a better world.For those who are lightworkers on the planet, and can see how Caesar plays with time and building materials like we play with light and love clairvoyantly and in the consciousness of the 5th Dimension and higher, you will know that Coppola has written a story for the ages to share the rising of consciousness on the planet as a truth to humanity.Those who resist, like Clodio and Wow Platinum with be consumed by their own greed and selfishness as the world continues to change.I liked the triptychs as well, showing how reality is getting fragmented in a multidimensional consciousness and how we can process several pieces of information across time and space, simultaneously.\",\n",

Even if it's mostly hokey, partially done by half baked old folk, he still did sell off his wine company to make this hopeful film for the future, and I really respect that. He doesn't have any answers, but he certainly raises a few questions, and thats all you can ask from a true work of art.And no, the five star rating is not ironic, because in a black sea of Deadpools, Megalopolis is The Godfather.\",\n",

Aubrey Plaza - shone in many other roles, but carries herself and her vibe well on this screen IMO.This production leans heavily into art film territory while working with narrative film tools throughout.The story plays through as a near standard narrative but the path it takes to get there is meandering and skewed at times feeling like we've lost our way - only to be thrown back to the narrative thread that runs through.Megalopolis is heavy on message and to say it is a thinly veiled comparison to our current political themes would be a vast understatement. That said, this message both has a heart and asks the future to continue to carry the best of what humanity is forward.Not for children. Maybe not for elder grandparents but there is plenty spectacle and performative entertainment that asks us to carefully think about what the film means and what we want our future to mean.A man sold off half of his life to make this film because he believed in the message.GO SEE IT.\",\n",

Replete with corruption and sleazy imagery of the elite class in gaudy Romanist attire and behind the scenes mechanicians, Coppola incorporates both an intense love story and hope for a better tomorrow. Nathalie Emmanuel co-stars as the daughter of the mayor of the city, a man who despises what Catilina is doing as a playboy and the ego-driven destruction of his city for Catilina own sleek futurist design. Suggestive images from David Lynch's Dune (1984) and Sean Young's Chani's own resemblance to Nathalie Emmanuel as Julia Cicero come through as Coppola has created an unexpectedly reasonable continuity throughout the film though at times unevenly edited and paced. Unlike many criticisms directed towards this movie, there is an important romantic theme incorporated into this film and the idea of a stand-alone visionary dreamer can ultimately transform society into something better has a vital message in today's corrupted society. Julia's own elitist character becomes transformed herself and her role as a counter-balance to Catilina and how their interaction with each other sparks a new form of consciousness towards humanity speaks loudly for the essential need for love in today's world. Strangely enough one could if attentive enough might consider this a feel good movie, something that might even be somehow a holiday movie.\",\n",

And it works, to a certain point.Every scene has metaphors and symbolism, layers of meaning to be peeled back and analysed. This film is sure to be studied endlessly in classrooms and lectures in the future.Yet, there is something not quite right, the movie isn't sure if it's trying for a modern feel, a 60's sci-fi feel or even at times an 80's gritty New York feel, and what we are left with is none of them quite working. The plot is there yet at times is lost through psychedelic sequences that do more to confuse than explain. And the science, the science is more science- fiction and should have been left at that, yet the one scene that lets this down is the mention of string theory and the universe having eleven dimensions, which felt out of place and really unnecessary to the conversation being had at the time.Whilst watching the film, at times I was unimpressed and at other times in awe. Leaving the cinema all I could think about was the message I took away from it, from the social commentary that I feel Coppola was trying to leave the viewer with. The fact three hours later I'm still contemplating what the film means leads me towards a stronger rating than a 5, yet the problems with the film mean it can't be a 10.

Time will tell.The first thing that I noticed about this movie is that it appears to be remake/homage of sorts of Fritz Lang1927 classics German made silent film Metropolis. A few months ago I just happened to stream the recently restored version of the 1927 film. It has a similar plot and some scenes are right out of the classic. The movie was still fresh in my mind so this movie made more sense to me.Add in loose interpretation of the Catilinarian conspiracy of 63 AD in Rome, some modern day political events and influences of the 20th and 21st centuries with some Shakespearean style dialogue for effect and the result is Megapolis.My recommendation is see Metropolis first before you attempt to see this film. It will make this movie more enjoyable to watch.',\n",

       "  'Review': \"Megalopolis is the movie causing the most controversy in 2024. There are people who hated it, who thought is was mid, who thought it was solid and who loved it. I'm one of those who loved it.The movie doesn't really have a story, only characters, things happening around them and themes surrounding them. These themes are the most interesting part of the film. Themes of the importance of conversation in daily life, in politics, the importance of creating something new. Some characters are afraid of the change, while others welcome it with open minds. The movie is mostly shown from Cesar Catilina's point of view, who wants the world to change and evolve, so the film's point of view is that change is needed, but I must emphasize that it's also important to have people on the other side being afraid of change to make the others remain realistic.The main characters are interesting, each of them represents a point of view. Catilina enforces the change; Cicero is afraid of it. On the other hand, there are lots of characters who represent a type of person. Clodio is greedy and he wants to achieve power through scamming the poor with offering them total equality. Crassus III is a wealthy man, who loves spending time with pretty women. Wow Platinum is a manipulative, greedy and good-looking TV presenter, who wants to achieve more power and have more money. In conclusion, the writing is good, but not that layered, so there are no character arcs and there is no real story.The direction is great, the film's quite complete. The cinematography is even better. It sets the tone and there are a few outstanding shots. The editing is probably the most interesting part of the post-production, because there are many split screens, which was interesting, but I wanted to see all of what was happening, so it was a disadvantage at times. The score was okay, the sounds were great and the production design was gorgeous. All the residences of the main characters looked amazing, while each one is completely different and unique. The visual effects were also outstanding. It wasn't meant to be perfect, because some of it was unrealistic on purpose and I liked that.The movie lacks a coherent story or character arcs, which is not a problem for me, because this film is metaphorical on every level, just like a lyrical poem: no story, only a little plot and metaphors. The time jumps were pretty random at times and the editing was a little strange sometimes as I mentioned before.Megalopolis is a very strange, controversial, visually striking movie about today's society and the lack of discussion. I understand why some people dislike it, but that doesn't deter me from loving it. In my view, Megalopolis rocks.\",\n",

       " {'Review Summary': 'Suprised at the negative response to this singular vision.',\n",
       "  'Review': \"Firstly, I liked Megalopolis a lot. It's convoluted and indulgent, but never dull. I see the film as a hypnotic, psychedelic, allegorical Shakespearean fairy tale. It's a story of Roman decadence in shades of classic Hollywood spectacle, The Matrix, and Citizen Kane. The film is loaded with visual flare, creative ambition and dense with entertaining moments and dialogue.At the film's core the Architect genius Caesar (Adam Driver) calls out the corruption and failure of civilization and presents an optimistic hallucinogenic vision of the future. Being able to stop time allows the architect to see the future and a direction forward to a better civilization. To be able to depict that vision, Coppola has stylized the film and bent it out of reality into a remarkable cinematic live action theatrical cartoon.There are many sparkling unpredictable scenes throughout, like the little skit Caesar does before he kisses his mother, who tells him she is disappointed she did not bear a female. There are goofy and funny scenes too, and one moment that caused me to gasp out loud.The film is demanding but not difficult and the themes are obvious. Perhaps a little too obvious. The sentimental heart of the film is about the influence of love which also includes a few powerful female characters. The story could have been a little more ambiguous, enigmatic and abstract. It's like mainstream avant-garde. But even that seems a bit too much for many, given the disappointing attendance and reviews.I have a cynical feeling that many viewers are put off by Coppola's visualization of our decadent civilization competing with the architect's utopian positive vision, and the somewhat happy ending? This seems paradoxically sad given civilizations love for dystopic, nihilistic, disaster, horror and apocalyptic films. A film that is idealistic and quotes Shakespeare and Marcus Aurelius would seem to be terrifying.\",\n",

       "  'Review': \"Megalopolis is one of the most intriguing cinematic experiences I've encountered in a long time. Directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola, whose masterpieces include The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, this film is the culmination of a passion project he wrote decades ago. After facing years of funding challenges, Coppola even sold his vineyard to bring his vision to life. The result is a film that left me perplexed, making it a film I'm grateful to have seen on the big screen.At its heart, the story follows Cesar Catalina (Adam Driver), a visionary architect locked in a rivalry with Major Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito). Cesar's complicated relationships, particularly with Julia Cicero (Nathalie Emmanuel), the Mayor's daughter, further intensify this conflict. The plot thickens as Cesar develops a groundbreaking material called Megalon, envisioning a utopia while the Mayor is content with the way the city currently is, aiming only to build a casino. As Julia becomes pregnant with Cesar's child, the stakes rise, intertwining with several other subplots that occasionally veer the narrative off course.The film's most frustrating aspect is its endless amount of compelling ideas that, with a bit of refinement and external input, could have elevated it to brilliance. Megalopolis embodies the essence of a great filmmaker, perhaps in his later years, embracing creative freedom, even when the execution feels too much like how he probably wanted it 30 years ago. While the CGI may not always hit the mark, I admired the visual style Coppola aimed for, immersing viewers in a strikingly imaginative world that, unfortunately, doesn't always align with the story itself. The supporting cast, led by a dynamic performance from Shia LaBeouf in one of his most unhinged roles, alongside some wild choices made by Aubrey Plaza and a captivating Lawrence Fishburne as the narrator, all deliver enjoyable performances, despite the script's shortcomings.The film ventures into the abstract, showcasing some trippy and unique imagery. However, even as someone who appreciates the avant-garde, I often felt that Coppola's vision didn't fully translate to the audience. Ultimately, my experience with Megalopolis was a whirlwind of emotions, I was impressed, bewildered, intrigued, and thoroughly entertained by all the chaos. While the overarching message may have gone right over my head, I can't recommend this film enough to fans of Coppola; it's a mesmerizing journey that simply must be seen to be believed. Megalopolis may not be a success, but it certainly offers a wild ride that I genuinely enjoyed, leaving me with the question: Why does it exist?\",\n",

       "  'Review': 'Personally, I don\\'t understand all the negative criticism this movie has received. At its core, Coppola is trying to develop a vision of a possible future, or at least lay the groundwork for a purposeful discussion. It is the idealistic legacy of a wise old man. He holds up a mirror to humanity and points out that it is ultimately in control of its own destiny. To remind his fellow human beings of this message, he puts everything on the line - his reputation as a director, and what\\'s more, he financed everything himself. Personally, I find it upsetting that this goes down so badly with his fellow citizens. Here is a man desperate to inspire positive change in this world, to give it back hope, and his efforts are ultimately not being rewarded. I agree with others, before whose eyes this movie has found favor, that this movie is a \"melody of the future\". He and others, not excluding myself, want to work towards a better future. The fact that the dream of a utopian city is not new does not detract from Mr. Coppola\\'s merit. In the context of the movie, however, this becomes problematic in that everyone imagines a perfect city/their version of paradise a little differently. But the audience only gets to see one version - his. Mr. Coppola, to shorten this sermon, has made his contribution to a utopia that will become reality, as he surely hopes, and he is not alone in this hope. The limit lies where the imagination fails. If that is not the case, then there is no progress.',\n",

The recently elected mayor Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito) is finding his popularity crumbling as he clashes with Cesar Catalina (Adam Driver) the head of the Design Authority. The resentment is further stoked by Cicero\\'s daughter Julia (Nathalie Emmanuel) working for and then entering into a relationship with Cesar. Clodio (Shia LaBeouf), Cesar\\'s cousin and Wow Platinum (Aubrey Plaza) Cesar\\'s ex-lover plan to exploit both the wealth of Crassus (Jon Voight) and the frustration of the population to fuel their own rise to power.So, perhaps the oddest thing about \"Megalopois\" is that there is a relatively straight forward and potentially brilliant film at its core. The fall of ancient Rome, juxtaposed with comparisons with modern day America (or the West in general) is a great idea. I can\\'t imagine that Coppola would have struggled to get a studio to help, or completely finance that pitch. The trouble is - built on that skeleton of a good idea is a film chocked full of nonsense that I can only imagine that Coppola believed so strongly in, he wouldn\\'t let them go and the investors walked away. For example, and I don\\'t think this is a spoiler as it was in the trailers - Adam Driver\\'s Cesar Catalina can stop time. How and why is never really explained properly by the film, nor does this really function as part of the plot, he just can for seemingly aesthetic reasons.On top of the crazy ideas, of which time stopping is only one of them, you also have other more conventional problems, such as amateurish performances, perhaps stemming from the improvisational spirit that apparently was what Coppola encouraged. There are numerous bits of the plot that don\\'t go anywhere and way too many characters to service, both of which facilitate a bloated runtime.Still, I didn\\'t really hate it. Aubrey Plaza is excellent, and I suppose, on some level, I\\'d always prefer a big swinging failure over a safe and boring committee anodyned film. I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever feel the need to watch it again, but you probably need to see it, if only to believe it actually happened.', 'Rating': '6', 'Author': 'southdavid', 'Date': 'Oct 8, 2024'}, {'Review Summary': 'The Most Unique Film of the Year, If Nothing Else', 'Review': 'Pre-Megalopolis ExperienceSince this movie is about time, I will write this review before and after seeing it since I want to tell you how excited I am. You will know when the review begins; do not worry! I am not a die-hard Francis Ford Coppola fan, as I had only seen \"The Godfather\" and \"The Outsiders\" beforehand. The road to release has been interesting. It took 40 years for Coppola to complete and fund this, and its controversial Cannes debut led to the film struggling to find a U. S. distributor until Lionsgate a month later. And who can forget the AI-generated critic quotes in the trailer? How did they let that happen? Following these events from May onward and the film\\'s polarizing reception oddly excite me since it looks like the year\\'s most unique experience. I am not saying it will be better than \"The Substance,\" but its ambitions will carry it far. Good, bad, or mid, it has my curiosity and attention. Here\\'s hoping it is something wild!Post-Megalopolis Experience\\n\"Megalopolis\" is indeed something wild! However, its ambitions do let it down in a lot of departments. Thankfully, for better or worse, I was right in my assessment that it was the most unique experience of the year.On to the positives, aside from Shia LaBeouf in the first half, all the actors played their characters exceptionally well. Adam Driver was great as Cesar Catilina, an artist looking for what he believed to be the best future for New Rome. Nathalie Emmanuel delivers a surprising performance as Julia Cicero, the daughter of the mayor of New Rome. I was hesitant to know how she would do since the other films I have seen her in - her role as Ramsey in the Fast & Furious franchise and her miscast character Zee in this year\\'s disappointing John Woo outing \"The Killer\" - were not the best vehicles for her. I am pleased to report that she delivers a performance that stands out among the rest of the cast. Other actors like Jon Voight, Laurence Fishburne, Aubrey Plaza, Jason Schwartzman, Dustin Hoffman, and especially Giancarlo Esposito round out a dedicated cast.Additionally, the visuals are mind-blowing. From the trailers, I was expecting a visual marble, and it did not disappoint! Whether it is the moving statues, the City of New Rome, or the material of Megalon, this is the most impressive movie of the year visually so far!I also saw many incredible moments throughout the movie, such as when Cesar and Julia discover love in each other, the exceptional intro and outro for this movie, or when Cesar does drugs. Okay, for that last scene, I am mixed to positive on whether it is good since it goes on for too long. We will get back to the runtime when discussing the negatives.Furthermore, Francis Ford Coppola manages to impress directing-wise. Even though the script is not the best, which we will get to, Coppola did not phone it in. For a film that took 40 years to make, in which he had to use most of his money to market and release it, it amazes me how a director who is 85 can make a movie like no other.It is time to move on to the negatives: runtime. I am getting into the most blatant one then move on to the other drawbacks. The movie is 2 hours and 18 minutes, coincidentally the same run time as fellow disappointment \"Joker: Folie à Deux.\" I feel that that film utilized its runtime better, unfortunately. Many scenes drag or feel like they have no purpose, such as the drug sequence I brought up earlier. It makes the story feel less impactful than it already is.The narrative is confusing as well. That is not to say the story is confusing, as I understood what is going on, but in terms of engaging the audience, the movie does not understand what is necessary to bring up and what is not. It tries to show how Cesar\\'s dreams of the future may not help New Rome from falling and how people are not keen on Giancarlo Esposito\\'s Mayor Cicero\\'s ways either, but the film does not have scenes that make that point clear, at least in terms of leaving an impact. The confused narrative plays into the long runtime, keeping me from liking this film more than I thought I would.Now, the dialogue. It is trying too hard to be Shakespeare and be an Oscar contender. It is so evident and frustrating, leading to many lines of dialogue possibly making zero sense to a casual moviegoer checking this out. If there is a standout line, it would be when Cesar says, \"If you are pretending to be good, no one will notice. But if you are pretending to be bad.\" I never thought I would quote a movie in my reviews, least of all \"Megalopolis.\" There are some good lines like that here and there, but not enough to make the dialogue believable.On top of that, it decides to have a narrator in the form of Laurence Fishburne\\'s character Fundi Romaine. He is just a means to put forth a question to audiences and Megalopolis\\' overall purpose: if a city falls, does that mean the world falls with it? He does not add anything else narration-wise, at least for me. It is not Fishburne\\'s fault; it is more or less a problem with the script.For the remaining issues I have with it, the first and second halves are conflicted on whether or not to even focus on Cesar. I will not go into detail to avoid spoilers, but you will notice if you see the film.In conclusion, as one of my most anticipated movies of the year since May, I can not help but be disappointed with the film I got. Will this film get better with time, as Coppola claims it will? Moments from this film will, but I am unsure about the overall package. It has a chance, no doubt, and there are many fantastic elements, but it is one of the most disappointing films I have seen this year. Is it as much a letdown as \"Joker: Folie à Deux?\" Hell no, but it is still upsetting.Technically, it is a visual tour-de-force, the actors deliver solid work, and Coppola\\'s directing is second to none. The script, pacing, and runtime issues can not stop the technical score from being an 8/10.As for the enjoyment score, it may change, I will admit. After I posted my \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" review, it went from a 6 to a 5, so the same thing may happen for \"Megalopolis\" in a few hours, or the opposite where it gets better. Who knows? Check my 2024 Movies RANKED IMDb list to see if I am correct. As for me, there are things to love about this movie, but it undeniably has a lot holding it back. I feel it is a 5/10 as of right now. It is not the best farewell of one of the most influential directors in film history, but it is a predominantly enthralling experience. As to whether it is worth watching in theaters, however, if you have an increased curiosity or want to watch a visual spectacle, then yes, but renting, streaming it, or even buying it may be the best way to watch, in my opinion.', 'Rating': 'No rating', 'Author': 'a-j-kelly', 'Date': 'Oct 7, 2024'}, {'Review Summary': 'This is an incredible introspective allegory!', 'Review': \"I need to share some additional information because I think it is pertinent. I went, and watched this movie with my Dad earlier this evening. While we were in the Theater periodically different movie goers just started talking, and not in a faint whisper. They also laughed inappropriately at different parts of the film... Well before the film had even hit the half way mark all of the other movie goers had left the Cinema!Also while watching the movie I was considering going, and getting an Usher to deal with these rude people being obnoxious. So as the film went a long it just became more prevalent. Luckily though they started leaving before it was necessitated.Actually in a sense that right there is one of the main things the film talks about! The hedonism that encapsulated the Roman empire before it fell, and how that same thing is rampant in our world wide society now! I can go on, and on, but I think that will suffice. I say this because this film is something incredible that must be experienced! That is with the right audience.I need to put this film in another frame to help you understand what I am trying to convey. Imagine watching the Matrix, but there are no action scenes. That instead it forces upon you the malignity that is all around us. It wants the audience to take a deep look at themselves, and the world all around them.To start asking questions. Are they taking part of the evil that is portrayed? Are they being apathetic. Are they letting vice & sin rule over their lives? Are they being pessimistic, and in turn creating a self fulfilling prophecy? Are they being the best person that they are capable being for the betterment of mankind?After the movie my Dad brought up Fyodor Dostoevsky, and we started talking about the film. How it is an allegory, and well we delved into it. I don't want to give you any potential direct spoilers. We discussed the different subject matters correlated to what we just saw. Philosophy, politics, history, religion, etc...I hate to say this, but the candor of those other patrons shows their lack of understanding. By their immature response to this thing in the film, and an immature response to that thing in the film. Their lack of caring, and consideration for other patrons watching the movie. Even the manner in which they spoke.Now some people might correlate this film to the movie Idiocracy. In the sense that the USA is modern day Rome, and it to will fall unless people take action. I hate to break it to these people, but it would fall well before it approaches anything close to the film Idiocracy.I will say this about the film. The message in Megalopolis is that of an optimist who is in a world full of pessimists. These pessimists keep on destroying everything around them. Or rather time, and time again pessimists, and actually outright selfish/evil people, destroy society, governments, nations, and civilizations as a whole. As a matter of fact they destroy life itself. Including their own lives!!!! So we must be introspective if we ever hope to succeed! It is a fable of hope for those who have the eyes to see it!\", 'Rating': '10', 'Author': 'draverd', 'Date': 'Oct 10, 2024'}, {'Review Summary': 'Stunning visuals, weak story', 'Review': 'Francis Ford Coppola\\'s \"Megalopolis\" is not as terrible as some say. It is a strange film set in a fantasy/alternate reality world where New York is \"New Rome\". Adam Driver stars as Cesar Catilina, a Nobel prize winner who invented \"Megalon\", a revolutionary building material. In addition, Cesar has the ability to stop time (remember this is fantasy). Driver is joined by Giancarlo Esposito as the mayor, Nathalie Emmanuel as the mayor\\'s daughter (and love interest of Cesar), Shia LaBeouf as Cesar\\'s jealous cousin, Jon Voigt as Cesar\\'s wealthy uncle, and Dustin Hoffman as the mayor\\'s \"fixer\". The film is visually stunning, and the acting is fine, but the story is weak and convoluted. I think Coppola should have invested some of the $120 million he spent on the production into hiring a better writer. I would still recommend you see the film for the visual feast and good acting from Driver in particular. 6/10.', 'Rating': '6', 'Author': 'dlmiley', 'Date': 'Oct 8, 2024'}, {'Review Summary': 'Time Is on Our Side', 'Review': 'Megalopolis flashes with the declarative directness, self-importance, and stylistic overabundance of a whizz kid. Yet it was made by Francis Ford Coppola, an octogenarian wunderkind, who knows as much about the art of directing pictures as anyone who has ever lived. The movie is a curated ultraviolet trip to a place of wonder and awesome views, futuristic but with a downtown wash. Stunning shots and sensational scenes gift us an uplift of discovery. It\\'s a work of scope and dimension rarely achieved in personal filmmaking.Below the fantastical surface, the film\\'s straightforward storyline is a mashup of urban noir beats--desire and deceit, grand schemes and ties that bind, double crosses and empty promises--a mindful melodrama that immerses the viewer in the expressionist milieu of the moment, syncopated sidetracks included. Then there are fabulist takes on stopping the clock--effectively, imposing freeze frames--a spin off the metaphor that tech moguls and movie directors capture \"pieces of time\" in creating a gazillion gigabytes of data and dozens of feature films, respectively.Coppola may have drawn the seeds of the fable that became Megalopolis from his idea grab bag forty years ago, but it has emerged fully formed at a perfect time. Some now feel the U. S., a modern-day Rome on the world stage, should transition to a plutocracy, leaving pluralism and common cause behind. Salting his film with terse references to the Catilinarian conspiracy, an early threat to the Roman Republic, Coppola obliquely posits a renewal of our own republic via reaffirmed aspiration and inspired visionary thrust.Adam Driver plays a big picture guy for whom the Chrysler Building is a stepping-stone. His unstinting realization of character thrills from beginning to end. He\\'s a multi-hyphenate in talent and technique looking to redesign the city state of New Rome--an inchoate inertia drifting to dystopia--to better serve the needs of its people. In a movie whose overdrive supercharges realism, Driver grounds the proceedings by fully inhabiting his transformational hero, forging an expressive connection that promotes gains out of the shade of personal loss. He\\'s on a mission to infuse science, art, and higher consciousness into life, prompting people to progress, perceptions enhanced and promise fulfilled. With a story touching on chaos, the center holds because of Driver\\'s strong portrayal.In contrast to reports of improvisation off the cuff, the movie displays the fruits of improv nurtured within a coherent scheme. Coppola was sufficiently confident--having held iterations of the story in his head for decades--and the cast brave enough, to test varied approaches to scenes, unafraid of going too far out. Aubrey Plaza, delving into freeform creativity, pushes the bounds with emotionally wrenching moments in a film that is no holds barred. Coppola ends her key scenes with close-ups, allowing Plaza\\'s eyes and expression to speak volumes in the wordless aftermath of feelings exposed and risks taken. Nathalie Emmanuel displays performative choices of another sort. Her character is deftly contained, managing to choose figurative battles wisely, applying gestures and movement elegant but measured, in support of comebacks that are either rhetorical zingers, engaging entreaties, or words from the heart. Shia LaBeouf, full on, transforms himself into a disturbed, spineless, out of his crystal skull, populist pol, full of sound and fury, even as he suffers slings, et cetera.Giancarlo Esposito, as mayor, resounds with declamatory authority on political prerogatives and power, yet later lets glimpse the eternal flame of parental love in a sotto voce pleading for his daughter. Laurence Fishburne in narration and performance profoundly joins the symbiosis of a Boswell with the dedicated concern of an Alfred Pennyworth. Jon Voight, always adept at layers, masks multitudes of intention on the way to pointed resolution. Those three are joined by other Coppola alumni James Remar, Talia Shire, and D. B. Sweeney, and new collaborators Dustin Hoffman and Kathryn Hunter, in strutting their distinct stuff to bring essence to hellzapoppin\\' happenings.There is a reason why The Godfather movies are regularly broadcast at Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year\\'s Day, despite their overload of murder and mayhem. Coppola orchestrated indelible family gatherings and interactions steeped in love, understanding, and hope, deeply felt and nuanced scenes that have earned a place in our collective consciousness, underscoring holiday themes of gratitude, enlightenment, and the possibilities of someday. But unlike the losses and abyss rendered in that triptych, corroding yet not ceding the strength of family, in Megalopolis he paints a picture of regeneration. Conflicts are mitigated. Advances are made despite pitfall horrors and hits along the way. Familial ties are reasserted and multiplied, reflective of Coppola\\'s own extended clan and a bedrock of community.Driver\\'s phantasmic phenom lets the word go forth in fervently selling his blueprints for fulfilling the future, but Coppola delivers the essential goods through the imagery of his storytelling. He applies composition, framing, astute angles, camera movement, lighting, and editing in an unrelenting flow of imagination to put over the narrative--the work of a visual artist extraordinaire. That is his legacy.Legacy brings to mind Jeanine Basinger, the film historian, author, and professor, who recently received an award at the TCM Classic Film Festival for her dedication to creating new generations of filmmakers. Quoting Goodbye, Mr. Chips, Basinger makes a point of claiming \"thousands\" of children, in addition to her daughter, among students taught and readers inspired. In that vein, I imagine an untold number of emerging directors reupping props to Coppola for his commitment to personal filmmaking and for the filmic ode on regeneration and audacity that is Megalopolis.He completes his film with a formal stroke of picture-making panache, emulating others who have sublimely capped off masterworks. Think of the horizon adjustment that closes Spielberg\\'s The Fabelmans, or the young foal entering the frame after \"The End\" appears & fades out in Ford\\'s Wagon Master. Likewise, Coppola has crafted an unforgettable finale in a movie from a member of the cinema pantheon that is not to be missed. If you truly engage Megalopolis, the moment resonates beyond belief.', 'Rating': '10', 'Author': 'PeterMyette2194-784-55202', 'Date': 'Oct 8, 2024'}, {'Review Summary': \"Coppola's $120 Million Guilty Pleasure Destined to Be Cult Classic or Midnight Movie Pick\", 'Review': 'Megalopolis, the Francis Ford Coppola guilty pleasure he self-financed to the tune of $120 million, is partly a product of the very excess and decay his film decries. The writer-director represents the royalty of world cinema despite the impression he has not made an altogether aesthetically pleasing film since 1979 (Apocalypse Now) and his reputation rests on the three classics he made in succession near the beginning of his career: The Godfather, The Conversation and The Godfather II. His having the wealth and entitlement to throw so much money at realizing his long in hibernation vision for Megalopolis mirrors the elite and wanton family at the center of this fable. When you\\'re as rich and old and venerated as Coppola there\\'s a certain invulnerability built-in to protect against a pet project being ignored by audiences and skewered by critics. At age 85 though this is likely his last film, especially given the fact it\\'s projected to make back but a fraction of that enormous production budget (the film has made only $5 million worldwide as of October 2) at theater box-offices. Even accounting for whatever the film ultimately nets through streaming services, it may be many years, even decades, before it breaks even. That is Coppola\\'s business and concern, not ours, but it does seem more of a waste than a gamble.The thing that most stands out about Megalopolis is just how undisciplined and immature much of it is, and the fault Dear Brutus lies squarely in the writing, directing and acting. Despite this, I actually like the film as a whole for its unbridled conceptual take on the fall of the American empire. It has a weird energy that I got caught up in. Trouble is, none of the ideas in this inflated think piece are particularly new and too many elements play as if they belong to an overbaked and underdeveloped student film project rather than to the opus of a film master. Assuming that Coppola had nothing but yes men around him in the creative process, it\\'s a good example of what can happen when the most collaborative of art forms is hijacked by a single dominant voice and vision to the exclusion of other choices and second guesses.Coppola has been here before. His One From the Heart, The Cotton Club and Bram Stoker\\'s Dracula took wild, expensive, indulgent swings at big ideas with mixed results. The first two of those experiments failed miserably with audiences and critics while the third was a qualified success. His fever dream anti-war film Apocalypse Now nearly ruined him financially and physically but it\\'s also arguably his most satisfying and impressive film. On much smaller budgets he showed great daring and command with The Conversation, Godfather II, The Outsiders and Rumble Fish. A less successful stylistic reach came with Tucker: The Man and His Dream.For a quarter century following Apocalypse Now he was a director for hire and he had a series of commercial hits (Peggy Sue Got Married) and misfires (The Rainmaker, Jack) before he made three barely seen and mostly maligned personal, small budget films. Twixt, Tetro, and Youth Without Youth. I cannot personally assess these later works since I have never seen them but only one of them, Tetro, seems to be regarded as something like a success.Coppola\\'s ideas often overreach his talent or ability to execute them as evidenced by his first three major studio pictures, You\\'re a Big Boy Now, The Rain People(shot partly in Nebraska) and Finian\\'s Rainbow, all of which are interesting but uneven works whose weaknesses around character development and dialogue show up generations later in many of his films up to and including Megalopolis. I can only surmise that his best films avoided the lapses of those earlier projects because Coppola listened to others in the creative process and perhaps more to the point he felt extreme pressure to make magic happen. Indeed, much of his best work correlates to when he\\'s up against it with producers, executives, investors and the like. He seems to respond well to being embattled and at risk of losing it all. Seen in this light, Megalopolis is the work of a very wealthy man who can afford a hit to his pocketbook and ego. Whether he felt any real pressure like the old days in making Megalopolis is hard to know but he had very little to lose besides a small part of his financial security and a small dent to his critical standing because in the scheme of things both his fortune and reputation are secure regardless of how poorly this vanity film project performs. In the final analysis Coppola being untouchable in this way made him his own worst enemy in bringing Megalopolis to life. It is not so much an artistic failure as it is an example of absolute power\\'s corrupting influence. In this case, Coppola\\'s own hubris was the problem. Look, no one was harmed in the making (it should be noted he\\'s denied allegations of inappropriately touching extras on set) or viewing of this movie, but with some checks and balances the film might have been saved some of its more egregious lapses in judgment and control. While there is the spine of a compelling narrative story throughout, the mishmash of Shakespeare, Metropolis, Lost Horizon, Citizen Kane, New Wave, 2001, Monty Python, Ayn Rand, Terry Gilliam, The Matrix and a hundred other references makes it a top heavy watch. One that too often tests one\\'s patience and insults one\\'s intelligence.It is as if Coppola stored up all these ideas and references points and threw them all into the hopper on this one bold film and while some of them stick and fit, others do not, especially not in juxtaposition to each other. More curating and rigor was called for to give the film the cohesiveness it needs. Entire plot elements and characters are introduced without any real context and then, worse yet, never developed. Much of the film reads as unedited, unrefined notepad musings. Yet, for me at least there\\'s still enough there to hold one transfixed if not always satisfied. It is a beautiful, simplistic, trashy mess of a social-cultural-political-historical statement whose idealistic reach is often beyond its grasp, but that\\'s kind of the point of the film. Coppola is not a pure cinema visual stylist on par with, say, Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles, Ingmar Bergman, Akira Kurosawa, Stanley Kubrick, Terence Malick, David Lynch, Terry Gilliam, and that hurts the film\\'s attempts to take our breath away with the power of arresting images tied to meta ideas. That doesn\\'t stop Coppola from repeatedly trying to go there, sometimes to great effect but often not, and that unevenness is one of the film\\'s flaws but also one of the story\\'s themes: better to reach for the stars and fail than to do the same old thing or nothing at all.Megalopolis is about nothing less than human kind\\'s yearning and need for order and fulfillment in a society marked by conflict, greed, the lust for power and too much want. The story suggests that we are prisoners of the limitations of our own civilization. There are no answers offered, only questions. The danger in real life we are told resides in standing idly or passively by while Rome burns. We are encouraged to strive for more, for better, even if that means violently overthrowing the old for the new. History tells us and the film reminds us that all empires fail and fall, and everything points to America following suit. The real question is what will follow in its place? A repeat of all the past mistakes or something new, revolutionary, more humane, more divine? Coppola\\'s Megalopolis poses the questions. Even though it is wanting expositionally-speaking in how it frames these questions it offers an experience unlike anything else out there in theaters these days. If taken in the spirit of nothing ventured, nothing gained, then Megalopolis is a ride well worth taking. Just know that there will be plenty of bumps along the way. Then, too, don\\'t expect anything to be neatly tied up or resolved, even though it tries and fails to at the hopeful end. No, this experience is best taken as a dream with its own internal logic. I wasn\\'t high when I saw it but now that I think about it that might be the best way to appreciate it. Maybe then its flaws won\\'t be so obvious.Viewed in a different light, if this truly is Coppola\\'s last filmic hurrah, than it constitutes one of cinema\\'s all-time great \"f-you\" farewells. A defiant, unapologetic, indulgent, independent swan song that, for better or worse, brazenly says and does what it wants without any studio interference. He made the movie on his terms and his terms alone, which is more than most filmmakers are able to do at the end of their careers, especially careers like his that extend across seven decades. In that way, it is a kind of triumph for the octogenarian creative set.However he feels about it, his wet dream of a movie will go down as a self-indulgent guilty pleasure he could bankroll himself, otherwise he would never have found financing for it in today\\'s Hollywood. That it is destined to become a kind of cult classic that shows up on the Midnight movie circuit is probably not what he had in mind but that\\'s where it\\'s likely to find its most enduring life. That is both ironic and appropriate, too, since he got his start with Roger Corman exploitation pics before he became a prestige film director. In a very real sense, Megalopolis marks a return to his drive-in roots. We are left with a movie by an old man trying to recapture the anarchic spirit of his youth, and that is why the film is more than a little of an anachronism. Whatever is original about it is muted by all the rehashing and mixing of influences. Even with that qualifier, it is at least not another Marvel Universe or Harry Potter or The Closer franchise entry. At least he took a real chance at doing something to move the needle.', 'Rating': '6', 'Author': 'leomaple', 'Date': 'Oct 7, 2024'}, {'Review Summary': 'Going out with a fart', 'Review': \"Reading some reviews and watching Copplas earlier work had I no idea what to expect of this movie. Sometimes creative freedom can be good but in many cases does some boundaries have to be set, we have three arc structures because they work and we have Movie studios because they keep the boundaries of a movie (yes sometimes those boundaries can be to much) but in this case I believe someone would have had to come in and restrain this movie from not overwhelming itself. I really liked the idea of the plot, but the story didn't work as what I believe was expected. The movie can feel a bit rushed in structure and world buildup while the progression can feel really slow, some character arcs are not even fulfilled in the end which leads to the movie feeling undone. We get no explanation at all about character backgrounds or what the hell is even going on.The characters lack motivation and it is pretty sad to se that this makes almost every character in the movie feel underperformed, the acting does not in any scene feel genuine and it is a bottleneck of talent having these A+ actors get to play as unevolved roles as this.It was a good watch looking at the visuals but storyvise did the movie not have much to bring.\", 'Rating': 'No rating', 'Author': 'felixfelix-11207', 'Date': 'Oct 9, 2024'}, {'Review Summary': \"I can't believe it was this bad\", 'Review': \"I believe Coppola had 4 goals with this movie:\\n1.

This was supposed to be his magnum opus, the film to define his career-a bold, ambitious vision of an urban utopia plagued by ambition and decay. But, to put it mildly, the movie flops. While it's undeniably a spectacle, it's not the kind you'll be eager to behold twice. Even after two hours in the theater, I found myself searching online to understand what exactly I'd just witnessed.For those who don't know, Megalopolis was meant to capture Coppola's vision of a perfect city and the inherent flaws that come with human ambition. A depiction of the fall of Rome, but set in modern New York. This theme is intriguing but sorely underwhelming in execution. Perhaps it's a metaphor for Coppola's own career, from the glory days of The Godfather to the challenges he faced after founding Zoetrope Studios, a venture that nearly bankrupted him. Megalopolis seems almost autobiographical in a sense, a cinematic metaphor of his struggles in an industry that has not always rewarded his risk-taking.Shia LaBeouf is, without a doubt, the highlight of the movie. He brings a chaotic energy that makes his character both entertaining and memorable. He seems to revel in his role, creating one of the film's few bright spots. Following close behind is Aubrey Plaza, who plays a provocative character who schemes and manipulates her way through the film. Though her character isn't exactly likable, Plaza's performance is undoubtedly engaging.On the other hand, Adam Driver's performance feels like a missed opportunity. His portrayal is flat, lacking the charisma and intensity that might have brought his character to life. Though Driver is known for his powerful performances, here he seems overshadowed by his more eccentric co-stars.Jon Voight also deserves a mention as one of the film's funniest characters. His dry wit and perfectly timed one-liners add an unexpected layer of humor that keeps the movie from becoming unbearably dreary. He's the third most entertaining character, bringing a rare sense of levity to an otherwise heavy-handed narrative.Nathalie Emmanuel's character starts off unlikable but grows on you by the end. Her arc becomes more profound as the movie progresses, adding depth to a cast mostly focused on dramatics and extravagance.Dustin Hoffman makes a brief appearance, and although his role is small, he manages to deliver a couple of laugh-out-loud moments. Jason Schwartzman also pops up a few times, delivering a few laughs as well, though he doesn't steal the show as much as some of the others.And then there's Laurence Fishburne, whose narration might be one of the film's few redeeming qualities. His voiceover work is compelling, grounding the film's lofty, sometimes confusing concepts with a gravitas only he could deliver. It's easily one of the best narrative performances he's given in recent years.The viewing experience was bizarre. There were only four other people in the theater with me, and as the film progressed, it turned into a chaotic spectacle. Most of us were laughing out loud, reacting to how bad it was becoming. There were even moments of pure shock, where the absurdity of what was happening on screen left us all genuinely baffled.Megalopolis is a film that tried to do too much and achieved too little. It's ambitious, yes, and visually stunning, but ambition without direction leads to a muddled mess.\", 'Rating': '2', 'Author': 'mishahaynie', 'Date': 'Oct 8, 2024'}, {'Review Summary': \"It's Simply Awful. Worst Cinematic Experience I've Had\", 'Review': 'After reading the feedback on this movie I decided to give it a chance because several were suggesting that perhaps some simply misunderstood it or arrogantly suggested that for some reason others simply didn\\'t have the intellect or taste to understand the true art that it is. With all this in mind I gave it every effort to see where Coppola is coming from.I understood the movie and all that is on display is a heaping hot waste of 120 million dollars. In this work I see that Coppola is trying to make 3 main statements: that America is headed on a destructive course like Rome, that if only we could identify the \"enlightened\" amoung us and essentially surrender our liberties to them we could reverse course, and that American culture itself is decaying and that the construction of this film proves it.Coppola clearly sees modern film as unsophisticated and lacking intellectual value. In making this he\\'s trying to wind back the clock. The problem is that he\\'s forgotten that film in the past actually had stories to tell and that there are essential components to doing so. The fix to modern film wasn\\'t to make a boring movie with scenes that don\\'t connect at all attached with quotes with no relevance to anything simply because they were stated by famous people of the past. The movie is presented like a student who writes an essay with dictionary words they don\\'t understand in order to come across as more intelligent than they truly are. The amount of money put into the optics of the movie is essentially the same as the student also adding a title page with glitter. It makes it more shiny but doesn\\'t add anything to the substance.As for its contents, the idea of there being some individual who could create a new utopian world if everyone would just give into their ideas is no new concept. In fact, those ideas have resulted in the deaths of millions in real life. Nevermind the fact that one of the new technological features of this new utopian world presented by Driver\\'s character is a fancy shining airport-like crosswalk? Nothing about Driver\\'s odd but apparently brilliant character is intriguing or really convincing even that he could create a better world.I think perhaps even more confusing is how he presents Driver\\'s annoying jealous cousin played by Laboeuf as the want to be dictator and main barrier to the new utopian world. While he certainly is an unbecoming character , the fact that without his existence that everything would just be sunshine and rainbows is ridiculous.They also present the current mayor as behind on the times and somewhat of a simpleton for not understanding Cesar Catalina\\'s (Driver\\'s) grand city plans. In my view he made the most sense in governing in the world as it was and not simply engaging in thought experiments. They also presented the people complaining about Cesar demolishing their homes to create his utopia as simply not understanding the bigger picture. Im not sure why even once they didn\\'t present Cesar as a villain, the man was ruining peoples lives and they had every right to hate him for it.Beyond issues with the actual story, the largest issue beyond anything else is simply that it is just so boring. The minutes of the film drag on and on and with almost no coherence between scenes. I couldn\\'t help but continuously check my watch.

From beginning to end, I was completely captivated by its storytelling, themes, and characters. The film manages to balance entertainment with a deeper message, all while keeping the audience engaged without feeling too preachy. It was a wonderful experience, and I truly enjoyed every moment of it. The way it explores love, kindness, and society's more manipulative side was incredibly well done, and Francisco, the director, deserves high praise for his work. I'm so glad I didn't listen to the critics on this one.One of the strongest aspects of the movie is how it conveys a powerful message about humanity without being too overbearing. Instead of lecturing the audience, the film allows its story and characters to reveal the complexities of life, love, and human nature. The way it shows society's greed and manipulation is subtle but effective. It never feels like the movie is forcing a moral lesson on the audience, which is part of what makes it so compelling.The themes of love and kindness are central to the film and are portrayed in a way that feels authentic and moving. Whether it's romantic love, familial bonds, or the simple act of kindness between strangers, the film demonstrates how these elements can transform lives. The characters, while flawed, are depicted with such warmth and realism that it's easy to connect with them. There's an underlying message about the power of kindness in a world that can often be harsh and self-serving, and it's delivered beautifully through the characters' actions rather than their words.Francisco's direction is one of the film's biggest strengths. He has a unique ability to craft scenes that are both emotionally resonant and visually stunning. The pacing of the movie is perfect-there's never a dull moment, but it also gives the audience time to reflect on the deeper themes. The way he balances the emotional highs and lows of the film is masterful, making every scene feel purposeful and impactful. Francisco's vision for the film clearly shines through, and it's clear that he put a lot of care into making sure the story was told in the best possible way.The movie also does an excellent job of depicting the darker side of society, particularly how greed and manipulation can influence people's decisions. However, it does this without being too cynical or negative. There's always an underlying hope throughout the film, showing that love and kindness can triumph over these negative forces. The movie never loses sight of its core message-that in the end, it's the choices we make and the love we share that define us, not the greed or power we might pursue.What really stood out to me was how different my experience of the movie was compared to the opinions of some critics. I had heard mixed reviews, but I'm so glad I trusted my instincts and went to see the movie myself. It was a reminder that personal experiences with films can often differ from what the general consensus might be. This movie was truly an exceptional piece of work, and I'm glad I gave it a chance despite the criticism it received. Sometimes, it's worth making up your own mind, and this film is a perfect example of that.I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a meaningful and enjoyable cinematic experience. It's a film that not only entertains but also makes you think about the choices we make in life and the impact we have on others. With its thoughtful storytelling, excellent direction, and compelling characters, this movie is a must-see. I loved it, and I'm confident others will too. It's the kind of film that leaves a lasting impression, and I'm grateful to have experienced it firsthand.\", 'Rating': '10', 'Author': 'jycshdr', 'Date': 'Oct 8, 2024'}, {'Review Summary': 'A Confusing Masterpiece', 'Review': \"Of all the things that can be said about it, this is undoubtedly a piece of art from one of the finest masters in the genre. It's difficult to describe, and that may be the point.It's based on an ancient Roman event and treated like a modern day spin of an ancient Greek opera. It's packed with subtext from the obvious to the obscure. Comparing current day America to the Roman Empire right before its collapse is inspiring, like substituting Madison Square Garden for the Colosseum. It requires paying close attention and even then a lot of stuff doesn't seem to make much sense. It's not sloppy like a poorly made movie, but something purposely convoluted like an arthouse film. There's so much going on and so much that isn't explained or concluded, ultimately left to the audience to figure out.The cast is amazing. This is one of the most complex and dynamic roles Adam Driver has done, and he absolutely nails it. It's nice to see Giancarlo Esposito play someone other than the villain. Aubrey Plaza chews up the scenery. Shia LaBeouf disappears into the role. Talia Shire gives a touching performance.The film looks amazing. Stylized and not quite realistic. The scenes atop the clock high above the city are the best looking. Considering that Coppola hasn't done a special effects heavy movie before, he does an amazing job with it here.Ultimately, it's a movie that cannot be accurately described, only experienced.

We are accustomed to stories where there is no need to think at all. Everything is given to us already prepared. Most movies have become bland, repetitive stories, lacking imagination and, most importantly, with nothing to say. I enjoyed it from beginning to end, and it moved me to tears.

Looks, and worldly success are exactly the motivations of the old world that Coppola is criticizing - if they are in a soap opera, it is because the world, in this vibration, tends to operate as one, where vengeance, revenge, jealousy and ownership are the drivers to meaning in life. If movies like Batman, in its Gotham city, can have outsize characters, why can't Megalopolis?And the higher vibration and consciousness being brought into the planet by Cesar (Adam Driver) and Julia Cicero (Nathalie Emmanuel) focused on love, equity, peace, harmony, creativity is powered by the mythic building substance that Cesar has discovered and won the Nobel prize for that is alive, generates light, regenerates the body like stem cells, and allows for time to be stopped and reality to be re-created into a world that is flowing in unity, harmony and love.That Adam is almost finished and loses his powers without the appearance of Julia in his life is a nod by Coppola to the Twin Flame power of two souls in harmony, when they come together, are even more powerful than individually.Coppola not only puts forward a vision, a dream for a better world, but allows for the fantastic building materials to be a metaphor for working with energy and LOVE and LIGHT from a higher consciousness perspective to create whatever we desire. We are the creators of our reality, and we can create a better world.For those who are lightworkers on the planet, and can see how Caesar plays with time and building materials like we play with light and love clairvoyantly and in the consciousness of the 5th Dimension and higher, you will know that Coppola has written a story for the ages to share the rising of consciousness on the planet as a truth to humanity.Those who resist, like Clodio and Wow Platinum with be consumed by their own greed and selfishness as the world continues to change.I liked the triptychs as well, showing how reality is getting fragmented in a multidimensional consciousness and how we can process several pieces of information across time and space, simultaneously.\", 'Rating': '9', 'Author': 'shariqmahbub', 'Date': 'Oct 8, 2024'}, {'Review Summary': 'Wow times platinum', 'Review': \"Wow x platinum.

There are people who hated it, who thought is was mid, who thought it was solid and who loved it. I'm one of those who loved it.The movie doesn't really have a story, only characters, things happening around them and themes surrounding them. These themes are the most interesting part of the film. Themes of the importance of conversation in daily life, in politics, the importance of creating something new. Some characters are afraid of the change, while others welcome it with open minds. The movie is mostly shown from Cesar Catilina's point of view, who wants the world to change and evolve, so the film's point of view is that change is needed, but I must emphasize that it's also important to have people on the other side being afraid of change to make the others remain realistic.The main characters are interesting, each of them represents a point of view. Catilina enforces the change; Cicero is afraid of it. On the other hand, there are lots of characters who represent a type of person. Clodio is greedy and he wants to achieve power through scamming the poor with offering them total equality. Crassus III is a wealthy man, who loves spending time with pretty women. Wow Platinum is a manipulative, greedy and good-looking TV presenter, who wants to achieve more power and have more money. In conclusion, the writing is good, but not that layered, so there are no character arcs and there is no real story.The direction is great, the film's quite complete. The cinematography is even better. It sets the tone and there are a few outstanding shots. The editing is probably the most interesting part of the post-production, because there are many split screens, which was interesting, but I wanted to see all of what was happening, so it was a disadvantage at times. The score was okay, the sounds were great and the production design was gorgeous. All the residences of the main characters looked amazing, while each one is completely different and unique. The visual effects were also outstanding. It wasn't meant to be perfect, because some of it was unrealistic on purpose and I liked that.The movie lacks a coherent story or character arcs, which is not a problem for me, because this film is metaphorical on every level, just like a lyrical poem: no story, only a little plot and metaphors. The time jumps were pretty random at times and the editing was a little strange sometimes as I mentioned before.Megalopolis is a very strange, controversial, visually striking movie about today's society and the lack of discussion.

Directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola, whose masterpieces include The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, this film is the culmination of a passion project he wrote decades ago. After facing years of funding challenges, Coppola even sold his vineyard to bring his vision to life. The result is a film that left me perplexed, making it a film I'm grateful to have seen on the big screen.At its heart, the story follows Cesar Catalina (Adam Driver), a visionary architect locked in a rivalry with Major Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito). Cesar's complicated relationships, particularly with Julia Cicero (Nathalie Emmanuel), the Mayor's daughter, further intensify this conflict. The plot thickens as Cesar develops a groundbreaking material called Megalon, envisioning a utopia while the Mayor is content with the way the city currently is, aiming only to build a casino. As Julia becomes pregnant with Cesar's child, the stakes rise, intertwining with several other subplots that occasionally veer the narrative off course.The film's most frustrating aspect is its endless amount of compelling ideas that, with a bit of refinement and external input, could have elevated it to brilliance. Megalopolis embodies the essence of a great filmmaker, perhaps in his later years, embracing creative freedom, even when the execution feels too much like how he probably wanted it 30 years ago. While the CGI may not always hit the mark, I admired the visual style Coppola aimed for, immersing viewers in a strikingly imaginative world that, unfortunately, doesn't always align with the story itself. The supporting cast, led by a dynamic performance from Shia LaBeouf in one of his most unhinged roles, alongside some wild choices made by Aubrey Plaza and a captivating Lawrence Fishburne as the narrator, all deliver enjoyable performances, despite the script's shortcomings.The film ventures into the abstract, showcasing some trippy and unique imagery. However, even as someone who appreciates the avant-garde, I often felt that Coppola's vision didn't fully translate to the audience. Ultimately, my experience with Megalopolis was a whirlwind of emotions, I was impressed, bewildered, intrigued, and thoroughly entertained by all the chaos. While the overarching message may have gone right over my head, I can't recommend this film enough to fans of Coppola; it's a mesmerizing journey that simply must be seen to be believed.

At its core, Coppola is trying to develop a vision of a possible future, or at least lay the groundwork for a purposeful discussion. It is the idealistic legacy of a wise old man. He holds up a mirror to humanity and points out that it is ultimately in control of its own destiny. To remind his fellow human beings of this message, he puts everything on the line - his reputation as a director, and what\\'s more, he financed everything himself. Personally, I find it upsetting that this goes down so badly with his fellow citizens. Here is a man desperate to inspire positive change in this world, to give it back hope, and his efforts are ultimately not being rewarded. I agree with others, before whose eyes this movie has found favor, that this movie is a \"melody of the future\". He and others, not excluding myself, want to work towards a better future. The fact that the dream of a utopian city is not new does not detract from Mr. Coppola\\'s merit. In the context of the movie, however, this becomes problematic in that everyone imagines a perfect city/their version of paradise a little differently. But the audience only gets to see one version - his. Mr. Coppola, to shorten this sermon, has made his contribution to a utopia that will become reality, as he surely hopes, and he is not alone in this hope. The limit lies where the imagination fails.
