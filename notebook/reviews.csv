1097870,No summary,"Better than expected, but still not great. This Christmas comedy features Jack Black in a show-stealing performance, but even his antics can't rescue the movie from some dubious plot developments and a dreary backstory.The film's setup is that a dyslexic 6th grade boy tries to write a letter to Santa, but mistakenly sends it to Satan, played by Jack Black, who has some truly great lines. Our young hero, per Christmas movie protocols, is too good for his situation, throwing the deal with the devil into jeopardy. In the background, you have a dysfunctional mother and father whose relationship needs saving and a dead sibling, which comes out of left field later in the film.Overall, it's more fun than expected, and Jack Black really carries the movie, but the rest is too filled with awkward moments and inexplicable plot developments. I would have given it a 6/10, but I knocked an entire point off for the ending.",5.0,SpaaceMonkee,2024-11-29,0.0,0.0
1097870,No summary,I don't have cable or anything to keep me up to date what movies are out and at first glance I was like WTF Jack Black as Santa clause it ain't exactly my vision I got of him but then I watched this movie and realized he ain't Santa after all he is Satan's helper now that I could definitely see him playing and man what a great job he did. It was witty it was funny it was stupid just couldn't help the sense of humor. The actors and story line was perfect. Definitely check it out. Especially talking to a girl who have a mix feeling about Jack Black. Plus love the woman who played the mom she is an amazing actress if you haven't seen it watch her show Ginny and Georgia.,8.0,birchsandra,2024-11-28,0.0,0.0

1097870,No summary,Starts out cute. A sweet little dyslexic boy accidentally summons Satan instead of Santa.Goes downhill from there. Children selling their souls to Satan and it is played for humor. A big spiritual topic not to beade humourous for kids. It's confusing. The language gets progressively worse. Dead siblings used for laughs. Maybe the worst movie ever made. Save your Christmas...this was was a terrible and sad start to our holiday. Wish we could rewind our lives.Protect your kids...innocence mattes. Disappointed in Jack Black and Post Malone. Watch anything else...anything at all. Shame on the makers of this.,1.0,pjrag,2024-11-28,2.0,2.0
1097870,No summary,"You think , Jack Black is funny, how bad can it be? It's so bad, it's unbearable it's so bad. If you are thinking that this will be quirky and slightly cringe like Spirited, big no. This just reeks of below mediocrity in every way. The acting is terrible the story is non existent, the funny is not there. I hated every second of it and my poor family hated it as well. I feel guilty even making them sit through it. Save yourself and your loved ones from this atrocity of a steaming pile of crap that is being passed off as entertainment.

1097870,No summary,"Yes I know this movie is about a kid whole sold his soul to the devil. But if you understand it what was the true purpose, there was nothing like that. He did no wrong. The devil never took his soul. Don't know why people hate it so much. It's not that bad as it says. The movie it's good itself. It was very emotional, but entertaining. I would be watching this again. Overall it lived up to the hype it had no wrong doing. Very comedic, not that much horror to it. It definitely showed a lot of Christmas spirit. But it was such a great movie. Anyone should be able to watch it. I don't care what people say, it was amazing.",10.0,xsiple,2024-11-28,0.0,0.0
1097870,No summary,"My family really enjoyed this film, it's a great choice for the families that can enjoy toilet humor together. Great for families who have older kids. The story was enjoyable with laughs trickled in. It's not jokes from start to finish but enough to keep it fun. Don't expect Oscar worthy performances, remember it's a fun holiday movie not to be taken too seriously. The story never felt like it wasn't progressing and it had a suitable ending. The casting throughout fit, no one felt miscast. If you are on the fence about watching take the time to watch the trailer to see if you find it humorous. It's not going to be for everyone but it is fun nonetheless.",8.0,john-23100,2024-11-28,0.0,0.0
1097870,No summary,"A Charming Twist on the Holiday GenreAs much as I don't care for Jack Black personally, he's always been one of my favorite actors, and Dear Santa was a surprisingly cute little Christmas movie. It's not a perfect 10 out of 10, but for the genre, it's actually very clever. The writing is fantastic-whoever wrote this did a spectacular job. The plot is original, fresh, and offers a nice twist on the usual holiday themes, making it stand out from the crowd.Jack Black truly shines in this film. He's the standout performer, bringing a lot of heart and charm to the role. The other actors do a solid job, but it's really Jack Black's performance that elevates the film.I don't understand why anyone would give this a low rating-it's a delightful, feel-good movie that's perfect for the whole family. It's got humor, warmth, and just the right amount of holiday spirit to make it enjoyable for people of all ages. If you're looking for a sweet and original holiday movie, this is definitely worth a watch.",8.0,josborn5136,2024-11-28,0.0,0.0
1097870,No summary,"Only funny parts, really the only good parts are those that have Jack Black in them. Kid actors are kid actors, adult actors are mediocre at best. Writing, again other than Jack Black's bits are eh... Don't think it would hold anyone under the age of 15's attention and even then I only focused when Jack Black was on the screen. Jack Black was on point, his wardrobe was fantastic, and I don't think he's capable of NOT looking like he's having a blast on any film he makes. He's energetic, enthusiastic, and makes every moment he's on screen worthwhile. Watch it for Jack Black, fast forward through the rest.",4.0,pixikinz,2024-11-27,0.0,0.0

1097870,No summary,"Jack Black is undoubtedly the star of this film.His acting, eccentric mannerisms, and slapstick comedy evoke Jim Carrey's style - both actors light up the screen with their infectious energy!The film cleverly weaves witty and darkly satirical dialogue into a broader commentary on contemporary Western society, particularly addressing issues of childhood bullying and dysfunctional parent-child relationships.Yet the movie never wallows in darkness; instead, it remains vibrant, colorful, and full of laughs.Post Malone delivers an entertaining cameo, and true to Christmas movie tradition, it wraps up with a heartwarming ending!Perfect for holiday season viewing...Recommended!",7.0,rahkkas,2024-11-27,5.0,3.0

1097870,No summary,"I adore Jack Black so this review has nothing to do with him although it's not his greatest work. Indifferent to Post Malone, don't care either way.The children were the worse possible choices they could have picked. They didn't give the 'this is my first movie' jitters vibe, it was more like 'they literally dragged me from my walk home after school and told me to read from a paper' and they did so as blandly as they could. Not only was the acting actrocious, the writting is some of the worst their is. I HATED Little Nicky but as least on occasion a humor line was delivered, this movie had zero comedic value. I mean come on, a nervous kid mentioning his cat licking her nipples? Not a chance. Awkwardly saying toodles? Yeah that's believable but then turning around to clarify that he never says that? No. Not funny and just painfully cringey to watch, let alone listen to.I will never get that time back. Read the story Every Year Santa Left Me a Strange List of Rules.

1097870,No summary,"Everything from script to cast has all the elements of a good comedy. We aren't talking masterpiece by any stretch but at the very least a good family popcorn flick.To say that the Farrelly brothers phoned this in would still be giving it too much credit. If there is anyone to blame, it's the Director for not coaching the actors to the finish line to get a good performance. IT COMES SO CLOSE!! Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, moves so stiffly. It's almost like the crew got confused and has the camera rolling during the rehearsal instead of the actual take.This (lack of) effort amounts to what you could consider a really good student film.",3.0,mattegallegos,2024-11-27,3.0,3.0
1097870,No summary,"To be honest, Jack Black's career has been over for years now. He's been playing in worse and worse movies, starring behind anyone and everyone for the last decade. But this is a new low.In Dear Santa, Jack Black plays second fiddle to a 12-year-old newcomer. Not only is that a nail in the coffin of his career, but the story is just plain terrible and the acting far worse. Jack has faded to black.I admit, I used to like Jack Black. Back when he was new and didn't care to do roles that were insulting like hallow Hal and Tropic Thunder, but now, I'm glad that he's disappearing.Jack has faded to black.",1.0,studionorthproductions,2024-11-27,7.0,8.0

1097870,No summary,"Dear Santa (2024) is the newest Christmas-themed horror movie and it was fine at best.Positives for Dear Santa (2024):
Jack Black was very good as Satan and he is the only reason why anyone should watch this movie. The little boy in this movie was fine and I can say the same for his parents. Jack Black and the kid work off each other pretty well. I like that the kid learns to stand up for himself by the end of the movie. And finally, the last moment in the movie was funny.Negatives for Dear Santa (2024):
The movie doesn't really do anything to make an impact to help it stand out among the other Christmas-themed horror movies. There is a lot of humor that didn't work for me personally. I really didn't care about the rest of the characters and they were either very bland or very annoying.Overall, Dear Santa (2024) is a fine and harmless Christmas-themed horror movie that does its job fine and that's good, but it doesn't do anything else that can get me to love it.",6.0,jared-25331,2024-11-27,1.0,5.0
1097870,No summary,"Jack Black, you've done it again! This movie made me laugh, cry, and kept me hooked from start to finish. The story is engaging, and the comic timing is simply spot-on. Every scene has its own charm, and Jack Black's performance brings so much life to the movie.The ending? Absolutely crazy and hilarious! It's one of those twists that you don't see coming, yet it wraps everything up in the most entertaining way possible. I couldn't stop laughing. It's the kind of ending that leaves you wanting more, so here's hoping for a sequel soon!What I loved the most was how the movie delivers its moral message in a very relatable way. Beneath all the humor and fun, there's a heartfelt story that connects with audiences of all ages. The lessons about family, friendship, and staying true to yourself are meaningful and delivered in a way that feels genuine and not preachy.Overall, it's a perfect movie to enjoy with your family, especially during the holiday season. It has everything you'd want: laughs, emotions, a bit of craziness, and a beautiful message. Watch it with your loved ones and make it part of your Christmas traditions.

1097870,No summary,"I was genuinely excited about Dear Santa-the concept felt fresh and intriguing, and having Jack Black on board made it even more promising.But watching the movie left me utterly disappointed. They didn't do anything meaningful with the concept! If you're hesitant to fully explore an idea, why even start it in the first place?The writing was uninspired, the dialogue felt weak, and the acting was by far the worst aspect.The acting felt robotic,
Honestly, my high school theater group could've delivered better performances-and we weren't good! I can't fathom how a director watched these lifeless performances and gave them the green light!!!",2.0,Alba90,2024-11-26,15.0,8.0
1097870,No summary,"I am not one to generally watch or like Christmas films, but Dear Santa had an intriguing premise and so I decided to give it a try. I was honestly surprised by how much I liked it.I was concerned the film might lean too hard into slapstick or over-the-top silliness, but only one literal toilet joke dragged on a bit too long for my tastes. It focuses more on witty dialogue/situations and has some surprisingly touching moments.This film will no doubt get flak from the religious crowd for invoking the devil, which likely explains part of the low review score. However, I thought it brought something fresh to the table without feeling disrespectful (It even lightly touches on some theological arguments).The one downside for me was the acting among the child actors was a little rough in parts, but it is a minor issue and a common complaint in films with younger actors.Whatever the case, I'd definitely recommend giving Dear Santa a chance if you're looking for something heartfelt and unconventional that is still very much a Christmas film.",7.0,solemnphilosopher,2024-11-26,4.0,6.0

The storyline is well-crafted, blending heartfelt moments with sharp comedy that keeps you engaged throughout.

1097870,No summary,"Jack Black has really made a strong comeback in the last few years and I was stoked to see him in the role here. The introduction and the main character as a boy who believes in things his peers might make fun of him for and yet still wanting to retain who he is stood out a lot to me. It was also interesting to see the dynamics between his parents who clearly had entirely different parenting styles and either are too rigid and unempathetic or helicoptering over the boy in a way that nearly stifles his own individuality and labels him. Its almost as if the consideration for the kids welfare is somehow erased by being too much of either extreme instead of balancing things and respecting the boys personality, Likes and interests. It's a nuanced family film and though a dark comedy, still has a beautiful and heartwarming Holiday tale at the core. I enjoyed it thoroughly.",9.0,saimariejohnson,2024-11-26,10.0,9.0

But the cursing and nasty sayings were way over the top! I'm pretty much writing this to warn families with a loss of a loved one recently and letting kids watch it - basically at the end a demon becomes Santa? He ends up changes history and raises a dead brother from the grave and everyone is happy merry Christmas! Like Santa or Satan could change that- what a horrible thing to make a Christmas movie about what a lie. How horrible to think a child would think Santa could do that for them.That is not even including all the weird satan and God conversations and throwing Santa and the Easter bunny into the same category with them several times and several other things

The movie overall is basically a class ""C"" movie with no real reason to it. For a comedy movie, I do feel as if it were missing the comedy portion. Definitely not funny and definitely not a family favorite film this Christmas year.I see why it was released on paramount and not in theaters because it would not have done as well as they had hope.

1097870,No summary,"So Jack Black is playing a fun, loveable, goofy, version of Satan. He is everyone's pal and wants to be a friend to a kid. Christmas is about celebrating the birth of Jesus. The enemy of Satan. So for someone to write and produce this, they are intentionally trying to go against what Christmas is truly about. If you raise your kids to have a magical Christmas to include Santa delivering presents, I have no problem with that. My own son believes in Santa, teenage mutant ninja turtles, bluey, and more fictional characters. At a certain age, they grow out of that.

I was genuinely excited about this film and had high hopes, especially with a big name like Jack Black involved. But after watching, I'm completely baffled as to how he signed on to this project. The acting is so terrible that it makes low-budget Hallmark movies seem like masterpieces. The performances are awkward, cringeworthy, and downright painful to sit through.

1097870,No summary,"This movie is perfectly watchable.The humor isn't groundbreaking, but it's decent enough. I didn't find it offensive, except for one scene in the park that was downright ugly. The humor in that part relied on cheap, gross-out elements like farting, which I found unnecessary and unpleasant-perhaps aimed at the lowest common denominator. Personally, it just didn't work for me.The casting is solid. The boy was funny and, thankfully, not an annoying brat (unlike the kid in Young Sheldon). The girl from his class was cute, which added a nice touch.His friend with the medical issues, however, felt a bit over-the-top. While I didn't completely dislike it, it leaned into excessiveness for my taste.Overall, it's a decent Jack Black movie, but I docked 3 stars for the following reasons:The scene in the park was unnecessary and unfunny.The random 3-minute singing sequence-why did we need that?The exaggerated portrayal of the friend's medical condition.",6.0,klusik,2024-11-25,9.0,10.0

Great acting the two main kids are brilliant. Jack Black is perfect for this role and with all together it was worth watching. Both sad and funny moments.The story is a little bit all over the place at times and there is a part that you are trying to work out as to why the family had to move.

Jack black delivered an excellent portrayal of Satan enjoying the spelling error that changed a kids life. Many familiar faces that make up a great supporting cast. The kid was cute and genuine and relatable. You root for him. Jack Black is the light of the party though as you might expect.There is some light swearing but it's used comically and not for the sake of it. There is a cute relationship that develops with the kid and his crush and the behavior never feels outside the norm. Post Malone was cool, as expected. Big shout-out to the friend with big teeth, he's a real homie.I liked it. Others won't for reasons but some won't for some very specific reasons.

Each performance from her new movies gets better and better and in this one she really brings her movie star game!Ian Harding is very charming as Logan and one of my other favorite characters in the film along with Kristin Chenoweth who's a real standout as the hilariously overbearing mother!Other standouts were scenes featuring Avery, Logan and Callum (played by Jake Brennan).

I also just like how Lindsay Lohan come back from her roots, making rom-com movies the same way again like her old stuff. This movie is like one of those Christmas movies that you will like to watch again and again on the Holiday season, either with your family or friends. Also, the soundtrack after plot twist scene truly made this movie an absolutely unforgettable and very touching film.

1234811,No summary,Boring - with the actors hired I was expecting it to be funnier. Watched for Lindsay Lohan as will watch anything she's in but hadn't it of been for her would have switched off after about 20 minutes. The worse of the three Netflix films she's done recently. The other two were silly but atleast they knew what they were and had a bit more fun with it. Looking forward to freakier Friday and hoping Lindsay Lohan gets more movies with bigger budgets and better scripts in the future as this was a total let down. With this being said it's great to see Lindsay doing well again and will continue to watch anything she's in - even if it is something as boring and uninspired as this movie was. :),3.0,benjaminliepins,2024-11-28,7.0,5.0

1234811,No summary,"The rating of 7/10 is perhaps a bit too high, but I just liked ""Our Little Secret"". You turn on the film and you know perfectly well after the first minutes how it will end - the definition of Christmas cinema. So there are no surprises. This film doesn't revolutionize anything, but it doesn't have to either. It's just a pleasant, warm film.There isn't even much to write about plot. It's a typical story about two ex-lovers having to pretend they don't know each other, and that makes they fall in love again. Cliché - which is also not a flaw of this film. This is how it was supposed to be and it is.So it's another light Christmas movie that you watch to cheer yourself up and kill time. What distinguishes it, however, is the humor. These (christmas) films are practically never funny (to me). This one was and I treat this as the best recommendation. There is no complex plot, the characters are interesting at times, but nothing more than ""two personality traits and a pretty face"" cannot be counted on. Here also without any surprises - which can be treated as a plus, because you turning on this film you get exactly what you expect.Lindsay Lohan and Kristi Chenoweth shine on screen. They squeeze everything they can out of their roles, and their acting are extremely (by the standards of Christmas cinema) pleasant to watch. The rest of the actors are the background for them - which doesn't disturb the viewing at all. The most important thing for me is that there are no actors who clearly can't act, because it always knocks you out of the atmosphere when someone plays like a dummy.To sum up - the film as a light Christmas cinema is fantastic choice. It has a few silly things typical of the genre and a simple story and characters, but the film as a whole is pleasant to watch. There are moments when it is really funny, which makes it clear that Netflix has finally managed to make a decent movie with a Christmas tree in the background.",7.0,Podkowa,2024-11-28,6.0,3.0

A couple that broke up to find 10 years later they bump into each other at a family gathering. It could be the script that dulls the movie. Lindsey has star quality and we watch because of her, however the other actors are dull. Again, I think it's down to the script and directing to get the best out of the actors. I think Lindsey is doing her best with what she's got from the script.

Note that the ""7"" rating is from the context of Netflix Christmas movies and this is probably my 2nd favorite one (don't hate me but Holidate is my number 1). This movie is bolstered by good performances from seasoned actors, who made up for the not-so-great ones from the younger ones. I have an issue with the leading man though, or perhaps how he was written. He was so terrible at the start. So many red flags in early scenes and a rather nasty angry management problem. Sure, people can change but the running time did not give enough time to delve into that aspect so it took some time for me to warm up to the character. There were the familiar twists and turns but also some that surprised me. Not the best Christmas rom-com but not the worst.

1372028,No summary,"Overall, this was a watchable movie, that describes a somewhat steamy affair between two attractive stars, which, apparently, leads to real love. Considering the personalities, how durable? At least three aspects of the production make me question it. For one, and this is becoming common in movies, it confers excessive emphasis on the role of a child getting involved in adults love relations. Maybe, I am willing to consider it, children are not the same I remember in my generation. Second, the dramas are overplayed. The need to keep the relationship between the leads a secret, and the way they go about it, seems unnecessary, and ridiculously enacted.The family strains are also too harsh and feel forced in the contest. Third, why is this a ""Christmas movie""? Either than the events occurring at year's end, the story has no real connection with this holiday and its values. It could have happened at Easter, during Ramadan, or any other time of the year, without changing an iota of its spirit.Lifetime, in the past two years, has markedly pulled out of the frenzy of Christmas movies competition.

This one is also hilariously influenced by the Taylor Swift/Travis Kelce relationship, with copious subtle/not-so-subtle nods to each of them. I feared this would be really cheesy, but was actually endearing and funny. At the end of the day, it is hard to escape the classic and predictable rom-com plotline, and although a fun and appealing idea, the writing was lazy at times and would have benefitted a little more to have better small sport specific details. It would have been just another average holiday TV rom-com, but I think the casting director really saved the day. I don't know where they found the leads, but they really shined! Surprisingly enjoyable execution and believable chemistry. It seemed life they were actually enjoying themselves- sounds silly to say, but there are plenty of these movies where it seems like the leads don't like each other and can't hide it. As a lifetime movie, it allows for a little more PDA than Hallmark/GAFam, but was still very clean and appropriate for all audiences. I hope to see these actors in more films in this genre in the future. The supporting cast was also good.

1372028,No summary,"There's been a fair bit of Christmas buzz about this movie that tells the story of a pop star and a football player's unlikely romance. No idea where Lifetime got that idea from...!!Jokes aside, the film that is oh-so-loosely based on the Taylor Swift/Travis Kelce romance features plenty of nods to the famous couple along the way and when you set that aside, it's still a very good Christmas romance movie, one of the better Lifetime efforts in recent years. Sure, parts of the movie are contrived and you can see the conflict coming a mile away, not to mention the ending. Not that any other Christmas movie isn't similarly formulaic.Jessica Lord (who is absolutely gorgeous, and has a chance to look radiant in some of her costumes) as Bowyn and Laith Wallschleger as Drew Gonville bring their characters to life. I've never seen either actor before, but they play their parts well. Their scorching chemistry is evident right from their first scene together and it's what makes this film so successful. Very-well cast. Sometimes you wonder what the casting people see in a couple who are terrible on screen. Indeed, a lesser coupling than Lord and Wallschleger would have sent this movie down the crapper. Instead, their presence elevates ""Christmas in the Spotlight"" above the rest of the pack.Not an Oscar-winner, but great entertainment nonetheless.

1299652,No summary,"Rorschach's journey in Watchmen is a testament to unyielding heroism in a morally complex world. Despite his flaws, he embodies the purest sense of justice, standing firm against corruption and compromise until the very end. His unwavering resolve, commitment to truth, and ultimate sacrifice solidify him as the story's greatest hero.Rorschach's heroism begins with his refusal to conform. Unlike his peers, who either retire or work within the confines of the law, he continues his vigilantism despite the Keene Act banning masked heroes. For him, justice is non-negotiable, and his actions are guided by a strict moral code. He patrols a decaying society not for fame or power but because he believes it is the right thing to do.The murder of Edward Blake (The Comedian) sets Rorschach on a path of relentless investigation. Where others see a random crime, he uncovers a conspiracy that threatens millions. His determination to expose the truth, no matter the obstacles or dangers, highlights his greatest quality: an unshakable belief in honesty and justice. Unlike his colleagues, who grow weary or disillusioned, Rorschach never wavers.In the climax, his moral integrity is tested. Ozymandias reveals his plan to sacrifice millions to unite the world and avert nuclear war. While others, including Dr. Manhattan, accept this as a necessary evil, Rorschach refuses. For him, the ends do not justify the means. He boldly declares, ""Never compromise. Not even in the face of Armageddon."" This line captures his essence: a man who would rather die than betray his principles.Rorschach's refusal to stay silent about Ozymandias' crimes ultimately leads to his death. Confronted by Dr. Manhattan, he demands to be killed rather than live knowing the truth will be buried. His death is not a defeat but a final act of defiance, a statement that justice and truth are worth more than life itself.Though brutal and uncompromising, Rorschach stands as the moral heart of Watchmen. In a world of moral ambiguity, he is a rare figure who holds firm to his ideals. His tragic end serves as a reminder of the cost of integrity in a corrupt world.

1299652,No summary,"The alterations in this variation of the Watchmen graphic novel was more extreme than in Chapter 1 & the 2009 film in some ways , taking some big liberties with the story structure & certain scenes. However it retained the basic story elements of the original source, which the film version altered notably at the end.For me the structural changes & additions didn't improve the story at all & jarred a bit at first.Then I began to appreciate the fact that the original source would be impossible to do justice to in such a short space of time, & the changes didn't distract from the momentum of the film.So, maybe someone who is unfamiliar with the graphic novel may find it easier to 'work out'.Everything about the production & design of this animation is great. The music is superb , except that it be occasionally overbearing - drowning out the actors voices a bit much for my old ears.The animation itself is brilliant with many superb moments. Some people have complained about it, tho I imagine the same commentators wouldn't be able to watch any animation pre the CGI if their sensibilities can't appreciate the work on this. Animation is not meant to be solely 'hyper-realistic & ray traced', it is often about a 'broad stroke & impression' than seeing the texture of fabric on a CGI model. The animation should be in the service of the story, & here it does the job superbly.It should be remembered that the graphic novels 1st animation, that told the story most faithfully to the original, was about 12 hours long , 3x longer than the combined length of these two chapter. So there is no way it could be adapted in a one-for-one manner & it would be unfair to judge it as such.The changes in this version are noticeable, but it is also refreshing seeing how another writer (J. Michael Straczynsk -of Babylon 5 fame) would approach & handle the story without totally ruining it. Here he does a good job, that in places expands on some 'vaguer' moments in the graphic novel that are only more comprehensible after finishing the story.",8.0,rossmcdee1,2024-11-27,5.0,1.0

The featured people in this documentary tell a great story of the times. It is full of emotion. It's often funny, sometimes sad and equally maddening at times. It is interesting that we seem to have made so much headway in terms of equal rights but lately we seem to be regressing with regards to this.

It's a true story about how a gay owned and gay run dance and drag club opened in the late 70s in cold and conservative Edmonton and how it provided a warm and safe space for queer folks and their friends. The archival footage they uncovered shows all the action and I loved how they interspersed that with scenes they recreated dressing actors up as if they were in the 80s.And with the wonderful disco music of that era.I think everyone in the room, like me, was reminded of the queer space where they first made friends and had fun and where we began to feel the shame lifting.

It's also very cool that the original neon sign was found restored and raised on a wall near the club location!

Yes, it's about treasure hunters, as seen in many other films, but the backstory is genuinely new and well-told-it's cohesive and doesn't leave any glaring logical gaps that would make the plot hard to follow.This is a relevant point, especially considering that even many high-budget Hollywood productions today lack this level of consistency in storytelling.The acting may not be top-tier, but the performances are noteworthy. While the dialogue could have been further refined, as it sometimes feels stiff and underdeveloped, the actors deliver with genuine effort.I'd love to see this film picked up by other studios with a larger budget for a remake because its storyline brings fresh ideas to the sci-fi genre and is well-suited to serve as the basis for sequels or even a series.

The cgi is impressive for an indie film and I totally loved the use of miniature models and pyro for some scenes. The sets and costumes are impressive when you consider how many were required in addition to the cgi backdrops which must have be a huge task!

Writer/director, Philip Cook, did a great job of bringing a larger than life story to the screen with a modest budget. Though the visual effects were done on a budget they did a great job of bringing this new Sci-Fi world to life. At times I felt like I was watching a speeder chase in Star Wars Attack of the Clones, other times it was like watching a bar scene from Sin City, or even yet the scale and look of the world felt like that of Blade Runner. You can tell that Phillip Cook is a lover of classic Sci-Fi Films like these. And you can't help but smile at the nods to those worlds.From a technical stand point the film looked good.

1272422,No summary,"Ok, credit where due first. Not bad CGI ... then again even for a budget film you had better be able to pull that off in 2024! The staging was acceptable and the camera work showed some promise, but wasn't really there , especially when they had to meld the live with the CGI..And this is where I diverge from a bunch of reviewers that either only reviewed one or two movies (hmmm, friends and family?) or someone that rates EVERYTHING a 10. (Really? Just stop the BS.)The script does not even garner a 'meh'. Not only can you tell there is no polish, it sounds like an original write that never went through ANY thoughtful review. The acting was stiff as a 2x4. Did they even feel the parts, because I got nothing. And lastly, as someone with a modicum of science knowledge your premises, descriptions, and implementation IN A SCI-FI FILM where laughable at best.

1272422,No summary,"""Ghost Planet"" is a refreshing sci-fi movie that stands out for its originality. The story about siblings navigating space in a ship built by another race, with little knowledge of its technology, is truly engaging. While the plot occasionally slows down due to the competition for alien tech, it doesn't overshadow the film's captivating narrative and impressive CGI, particularly for an indie production.The blend of practical effects like miniatures, props, and built sets with CGI elements such as interface screens, projections, and the giant Tesseran robot, brings the film's environments to life. Memorable moments like the Babagaba Gum, the pizza delivery drone, and powering up the Galumpkis ship for the first time add to its charm.As a prequel to ""Beyond the Rising Moon"" (Outerworld), it provides a fascinating look at the origins of the corporations and their rise to power. As a sci-fi fan, I appreciate films like this that aren't just sequels, prequels, or reboots.

There flying car chases, interstellar jump points and the search for alien technology, It has a Babylon 5 look to it, which is not a bad thing at all.

1272422,No summary,"I drove from Milwaukee to Virginia to watch a new Philip Cook film in a theater and I was NOT disappointed!The film is packed to the brim with extremely ambitous concepts and visuals, which is especially impressive when you figure that it's almost entirely shot on green screen in the director's garage.The film essentially follows three siblings who work together as astronauts in a space-junk salvage operation. After coming across a trove of alien tech, they're forced to head back to Earth, all pretty bummed at the loss. They soon get a second chance to go back there under the supervision of Trudy, a questionable love-interest of one of the siblings who also happens to work for the corporation that hired them.For such a low-budget DIY kind of film, it's amazing the type of story that was pulled off here. Not only is the scope and imagery impressive, but the plot goes into some fascinating directions that I haven't seen before. There's some cheesey dialogue for sure, but it kind of adds to the experience for me personally, giving it some levity to balance out the cerebral elements and some of the more surprisingly emotional moments.It was great getting to meet some of the cast and crew from the film. Even though I was not involved in the making of (aside from a small Kickstarter donation) I felt proud on behalf of everyone there. It takes a lot to make a film at any budget level, but when you're shooting on green screen a garage, and are able to come up with something that's as rich and as satisfying this, you've got a lot to be proud of!Fortunately, you can now watch Ghost Planet from the comfort of your own home on Amazon Prime, which is way easier than what I did.",8.0,Captainnn,2024-07-14,6.0,5.0

It's fun, fast-paced, without any heavy-handed activism choking the dialogue and suffocating the plot. It's reminiscent of the classic space-opera formula, and that formula's roots in the classic serials. Favoring digital effects not unlike Babylon 5, rather than the expensive motion capture of hand-crafted scale models of Star Trek and Star Wars. Ghost Planet is filled with a distant future atmosphere reminiscent of a wild frontier, rather than a progression of the hyper regulatory world we continue to move towards. It's pure escapism: a trio of siblings, hunting for Tesseran artifacts. Treasure hunters, intergalactic dog fights, and a fast-moving plot.

These folks have managed to create an entire believable Universe - all in the confines of someone's garage.The plot starts off quickly and doesn't loose pace throughout the entire production. Some of the quirkier plot elements still make me smile when I think about them! The creative ""repurposing"" of items for costumes, sets, and technological objects is one of the few places that the true (much lower than you'd imagine by watching the film) budget of the movie shows through. They remind me of the pure joy I felt as a kid when I realized that the arms of the Daleks in Doctor Who are actually made out of old toilet plungers!!!Director Philip J.

1380717,No summary,"""Summer Rain,"" directed by Josiah David Warren, unfortunately misses the mark on many fronts. While it aims to share a heartfelt Christian message, it instead delivers a painfully predictable melodrama that feels more like a chore than an enjoyable film.Right from the beginning, the plot is so formulaic that it quickly becomes tiresome. The characters, played by Warren, Mary Becquet, and Ammie Masterson, lack the depth and development needed for the audience to truly connect with their challenges. The dialogue often comes off as clumsy and overly preachy, with the name ""Jesus"" mentioned repeatedly. This constant repetition not only distracts from the story but also risks trivializing the very message the film seeks to promote. I would argue that it almost makes the biblical commandment, ""You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain,"" feel irrelevant in its execution.The pacing of the film is another major drawback; it drags with extended scenes that add little to the overall narrative. Instead of creating tension or emotional depth, these moments feel like unnecessary filler, leaving viewers glancing at their watches rather than engaging with the characters' journeys.Visually, if there was not that opening scene from the birdview, does not provide much to counterbalance its flaws. The cinematography lacks inspiration, and the production quality feels low-budget, which further undermines the film's credibility.This is a real letdown in the realm of Christian films. It falters in storytelling, character development, and overall engagement. Rather than uplifting its audience, it leaves them feeling drained and unsatisfied.

All lead performances are fantastic, with Nili Bassman's Susan and Caleb Scott's Edgar at the heart of the story. The director, Chris Messineo, was a film school teacher for over a decade, and his directing here shows that although it's a feature-length debut, he is still an expert at controlling a scene and a set. Another aspect of The Strange Dark that shines is the comedy. While the film is a thriller first, it is still exceptionally funny due to its comic relief characters of Frank, The Kid, and Cole. The entire theater fell in love with these characters and quoted some of their lines on the way out. The film is paced perfectly between its tenseness, comedy, and touching moments involving Susan, Edgar, and their daughter Taylor.

Riley's emotions are hard to control and now that she's a teenager, her new emotions start to take over. Complexities of teenage life filled with drama, uncertainties and a myriad of other things that don't make sense makes Riley's life so difficult. But remember we have someone that is always there to restore balance in Riley's chaotic life. Finally, Riley realizes that it is okay to make mistakes, to be angry, sad, envious, anxious, bored, but in the end, you need to accept that it is what makes you ""YOU""

1022789,No summary,"Like a lot of people, I felt that Inside Out was one of the few Disney films that needed a sequel, due to there being so much potential in showing the inside of its main character's mind as she grows up. Now, after a string of, let's say, less than stellar films, Pixar finally bounces back with a sequel that's not better than the first, but about even. First, the bad: I have two notable complaints about this one. First, the basic beats of the story are a little too similar to those of the first film, a common problem with sequels. But to its credit, where it ultimately leads is completely different, though that does lead me to the other problem: the message. It isn't a bad one by any means, I just don't think it's made all that clear, though maybe I would understand it better on a second viewing. Despite all my grousing, though, this is still a really well written movie with plenty of funny lines and neat ideas (more on those soon).The returning characters are as strong as ever. Riley is still a really likeable protagonist and I love watching how her further development as a person is represented through what goes on inside her mind. She's also just as relatable as ever, experiencing all the concerns and worries we all felt as teenagers. Meanwhile, the returning emotions are all great as always, and I'm glad they all get in on the adventure this time. While I was annoyed at first that it took a while for the new emotions to appear, they made the wait worth it once they did. They're all as funny, relatable, and likeable as the returning characters. Anxiety in particular is a fantastic new character with enough energy to match even Joy and turns out to be one of the deepest characters in the film.The animation is as amazing as ever. More than that, while the story is similar to the first film, the scenarios couldn't be any less so. There are so many brilliant concepts explored here that feel as fully realized as if they alone were the focus of the film. Highlights include the sense of self, a massive system of beliefs that wouldn't look out of place in Avatar coalescing in a singular opinion, and the sar-chasm, a massive crater that forms when Riley says something she doesn't mean that makes anything shouted across it sound sarcastic. All this, plus the stuff outside, is beautifully represented by Pixar's signature gorgeous 3D animation, especially the plethora of amazing colors.Overall, Inside Out 2 is definitely on the higher end of Pixar sequels, Disney sequels, and just animated sequels in general. Is it as good as the original? That's debatable. But honestly, it doesn't need to be. In my opinion, it more than stands on its own. While I recommend watching the first, you don't really need to in order to watch this one. And in my opinion, that's always a sign of a good sequel.",9.0,gnperuti,2024-11-24,0.0,0.0

1022789,No summary,"Wow.I was really intrigued in Riley's story, and how once anxiety takes over due to puberty she pushes her friends away and tries to be somebody she's not (both figuratively and literally, as we see when anxiety replaces her physical sense of self)I wish the interactions between the other emotions and their story was as gripping and strong as it was in the first film, even though it is still decent here.It's not the best, but it's still pretty good and a great sequel to a film that I really liked as well.It didn't feel disjointed like a lot of sequels, nowadays but actually feels like a natural continuation of Riley's story, and honestly I would really be interested in a third movie where Riley is a lot older.The unique concept is very well expanded upon with the different emotions.It's not the best animated film this year but I would be surprised if it wasnt nominated.",8.0,ibbyrahimk,2024-11-19,1.0,0.0
1022789,No summary,"Inside Out 2 takes the emotional journey of the first film to a new chapter, focusing on the challenges of adolescence. This sequel explores how Riley's emotions handle the upheaval of puberty and the pressures of trying to fit in, particularly with her involvement in an ice hockey camp. The movie introduces new characters like Anxiety, Envy, and Embarrassment, who add complexity to the mix, representing the turmoil of growing up.While the film is visually vibrant and packed with humor, it's somewhat lighter on the emotional depth that made the first movie so impactful. The humor is more slapstick at times, and while the new emotions add an interesting dynamic, they don't fully capture the heart of the original, like the emotional sacrifice of Bing Bong. Nevertheless, *Inside Out 2* offers a fun and relatable take on the teenage experience, addressing themes like anxiety, self-doubt, and the messiness of finding your identity.

1022789,No summary,"""Inside Out 2"" left me with mixed feelings. The scenes focusing on Riley are fantastic, worth a 9 or 10 rating on their own. It's remarkable how Riley captures real-life situations, making her a relatable and genuine character. However, the parts involving the ""Inside Out"" emotions themselves felt tiresome. The charm of the first film seems to have faded, especially with the addition of the new Anxiety character, who ended up more irritating than Joy in the original.That said, there's a standout moment where Joy observes Anxiety and sees a resemblance to herself. It's a surprisingly deep scene, showing the complex ways emotions relate to each other. Still, the flashback felt unnecessary; the scene could have been even more impactful if left for the audience to interpret.

A few years have gone by and our beloved Riley is now a teenager, but with a new developmental stage also comes a new corps of personified emotions, and by extension a new set of personality clashes and obstacles to overcome as she struggles to maintain her true Sense of Self. In addition to the welcomed new personifications of Anxiety, Ennui, Envy, and Embarrassment, this also features a wonderful wealth of visual imagery, the kind only Pixar can deliver. Fitting in, valuing friendship, and honing up to one's mistakes are coming-of-age themes that get explored, and even though the overarching plot is a predictable one, the emotional impact is still enough to tie this all together. ***",,Special-K88,2024-11-08,0.0,0.0

Compared to 'Toy Story 2,' it may not be as rich in genuine sentiment, but it returns all viewers, children and adults, to the challenge of the act of growing up.I also enjoyed the comedy and the themes present in it and maybe because of the continuous showings or better comprehension of it allowed me to have less of the feeling compare to the first one although at some parts it is sort of teary.

1022789,No summary,"Part of the Pixar formula dating back to Toy Story was the ability to put heart into their animated characters, a real difficult feat. Not just a plot telling a story but real emotions behind it. It's no secret how this is accomplished. The script is honed and refined many times over. For instance, the Blu Ray release of this movie has a lengthy amount of deleted scenes, illustrating how the story changed and improved over time. This was quite noticeable how the focus of the story would require some abrupt transitions, almost becoming mechanical instead of natural.A lot of credit goes to Amy Poehler, the character of Joy. Her exuberance anchors the movie and carries a heavy emotional weight when she is sad. Same goes for the turbulence of adolescence as our main character starts encountering new emotions; anxiety, envy, embarrassment, and ennui (boredom). There is also the emotion of nostalgia. When she appears, the rest of the team shoos her away, too early for that. That got one of the biggest laughs in the theatre. While watching this movie for a second time, I marveled at how much depth there was to this concept. The potential for exploring this emotional world is just starting to get tapped in the Inside Out franchise. Certainly subsequent visits to the emotional world can tap territories barely explored. Like the emotions going on in adults, a teenage guy, and so on.One wise move for this story was to leave the console room for extended periods of time. We spent a long time in that space in the first movie. The story requires our heroes to journey to the back of the mind. What makes this especially appealing is that this subject works for adults as well, by displaying some real psychology. What also works is the fast pacing, giving the large number of characters their own moments in quick little skits. I liked how the character of anxiety was portrayed as having good intentions. The movie posits that anxiety might even be a good thing, forcing us to improve ourselves in the face of insecurity.So there are strengths to probably one the best Pixar outings in a while, not counting the first Inside Out. The new dimensions make this sequel not a carbon copy of the first film. The lively emotional leader Joy. The tight script. The story with heart. These are some of the ingredients that give this movie that Pixar Feeling. 7 out of 10.",7.0,kgprophet,2024-10-16,0.0,0.0

Are reviewers afraid to give a Disney movie less than a five?All the animation, colors, and world building are the exact same as first movie..no new changes.

My sister always says that when a niece or nephew turn 13, we shouldn't bother with them for 8 years until they go to college. This should apply to this movie. Given that the protagonist is a sweet lovely child in the first version, they went out of their way to making her very unpleasant and unlikeable and that includes her new main emotion, anxiety. You would think, given the obstacles she faced in the first movie, that she would have the confidence and strength to get through her teen years, but no...it's the opposite. She is mean to her new friends and parents and a brat to her new group.

There were times that the animation also got trippy at some intense parts.The new emotions are introduced as Riley is now a teenager. Their roles were of an antihero and it was Anxiety who took center stage that made it all the more thrilling. Putting pressure on the heroine. Getting her worked up to be accepted by new peers at the expense of her old friends. Overthinking. Lying to oneself to please others. All for a not-guaranteed future that she will not be alone. The other new emotions were underused in favor of Anxiety though it makes sense because of the setting and they all made their point and when they go to spotlight they are hilarious. Funny as well were the banters of old emotions Anger and Disgust. The puns are witty. Sar-chasm got me chuckling in delight. And stuck the landing.Bingbong got me teared up from part one but this second one is more mature and darker that made me like this one more.

1022789,No summary,"When Pixar returns to explore the inner emotions of Riley, it's unfortunately without the whit and astonishingly clever writing of the predecessor. Firstly, the plot feels at times like a revamp of the first film; the Emotions set out on a journey and end up realizing that whatever new emotions their host has, is natural and needed. Secondly, the new Emotions added to the cast (with the exception of Anxiety) come across as redundant. ""Inside Out 2"" never deals with teenage struggles in a satisfying way. Messages would have been conveyed much more heartfelt if Reily had a high school crush for instance. It's not a bad sequel. It entertains and has charm, but ""Inside Out 2"" simply doesn't resonate as well as its predecessor.",5.0,snowfre,2024-10-09,2.0,0.0
1022789,No summary,"Inside Out 2 is an absolute triumph, not just as a sequel, but as a movie that perfectly captures the emotional complexity of growing up-both for kids and adults. Pixar has done it again, blending stunning animation, heartwarming characters, and a message that resonates deeply in today's world.Let's start with the animation, which is nothing short of breathtaking. The world inside the mind feels just as rich and vibrant as it did in the first film, and this time, it's even more imaginative. The design of the various ""Emotions"" and the environments they inhabit feels fresh, with every little detail adding to the immersive experience. It's Pixar at its absolute best-beautiful to look at, but with so much more going on underneath the surface.But where Inside Out 2 really shines is in its characters. The original gang-Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust-are back and still just as lovable, but this time, we get a new character who is a game-changer: Anxiety. Introducing Anxiety was such a smart and timely decision, especially with the growing conversation around mental health. It's a character that kids can easily relate to, and its inclusion feels like a natural progression from the first movie's exploration of emotions. Anxiety isn't just an abstract concept here; it's a character kids can ""meet"" and understand. For my own kids (7 and 9), watching Anxiety navigate the challenges of daily life was eye-opening. It was like a light bulb went off-suddenly, they understood some of their own feelings in a way that was both accessible and comforting.The way the film delicately and thoughtfully handles mental health is one of its greatest strengths. It's funny, it's emotional, and it's so incredibly well-crafted that it speaks to both kids and adults on different levels. As a parent, it was so rewarding to see my kids not only laugh at the silly antics of the characters but also have genuine ""Aha!"" moments about how their own emotions can sometimes get the better of them. It opens up conversations about emotions, stress, and the importance of managing your feelings in a way that feels natural and not forced.And let's not forget the heartwarming moments that Pixar is known for. There are several scenes that will tug at your heartstrings-moments where you'll find yourself both laughing and wiping away a tear. It's the kind of storytelling that Pixar has mastered, striking a balance between entertaining and educating without ever feeling like it's talking down to the audience.All in all, Inside Out 2 is a brilliant sequel that will leave you smiling, thinking, and maybe even hugging your little ones a little tighter. It does what great animated movies do: it entertains, it teaches, and it brings families closer together in understanding the emotions that make us human. My kids adored every minute of it, and I did too. Whether you're a parent, a kid, or someone who just loves great storytelling, Inside Out 2 is a must-see. Pixar has once again nailed it, and this time, they've done it with even more heart.",10.0,BaronBadger,2024-10-07,0.0,2.0

That said this is an enjoyable sequel full of the stuff that made the first one so touching.

1022789,No summary,"Personified emotions wear furry, colorful skins and mash a mental control panel in Pixar's latest half-baked sequel. Apart from the Toy Story franchise, which excelled in its second and third entries before succumbing to the law of averages (can you tell I'm not excited about the forthcoming Toy Story 5?), the studio doesn't have a great track record with follow-ups. This example doesn't buck the trend. Where the first Inside Out was primarily concerned with Joy and Sadness, forced to cooperate in an uneasy metaphorical alliance, Inside Out 2 wrangles the whole gang into a very similar extra-cranial adventure. Everyone apart from Sadness, that is, who's volunteered for an off-screen stealth mission and forgotten for large portions of the film.The bigger party doesn't make for an improved rapport. These characters have already worked through most of their issues, so there's very little internal conflict, and their relations aren't as diametric and well-matched as the previous expedition. It also seems that many of their core attributes have been softened in the interim. Joy loses hope; Anger doesn't blow his top so easily; Disgust nearly becomes Lust when she meets a masculine video game character; Fear... well, okay, Fear remains in a constant state of alarm. They're confronted by a new set of emotions, sprung by overnight puberty: Anxiety, Jealousy, Embarrassment and Ennui. Of these, only Anxiety has any real bearing on the plot, spinning her nervous energy into an attack (get it?) that threatens to ruin the inner harmony our original crew worked so hard to maintain. If I thought the first supporting characters were disposable, these guys already have one foot in the can.There's always ripe fruit to be picked on the tree of adolescence. That's especially true for a film series that's so essentially connected with emotional turmoil. On a few occasions, we can feel Inside Out 2 touching those sensitive strings. Then it draws back, as if afraid to institute any major changes to the status quo. It's primarily a kids' movie, so I can somewhat understand that reluctance. Problem is, without any heady spiritual beats, the heavy lifting falls to the film's more creatively-inclined aspects. And those, by comparison, are just a weak impersonation of the first film. We visit many of the same locales and find them significantly reduced in color and energy. The story is a mildly re-heated iteration, at best. The old team feels played out (especially with a pair of unwelcome re-castings) and the new members add very little. It took me a couple viewings to really warm to the original, so maybe that'll also be the case for Inside Out 2. Until then, my thoughts can be summarized in just two words: nothing special.",5.0,drqshadow-reviews,2024-10-05,0.0,1.0
1022789,No summary,"I must say there is quite a leap in character model animation quality, compared to 10 years ago regarding Pixar. The human models move and animate much more realistically compared to the first film. Same for their expressions.Film tries to go a different route compared to the first film, exploring puberty and adolescence. And it could have succeeded if it were not for the 6 year age rating that severely limited such a possibility. Essentially the audience follows a middle school girl that feels like an elementary school girl.I seriously expected some sort of bullying or cyber bullying later on the way the film went through, which would have made it much more dramatic. Also the friction with her parents is much less tense when compared to the first film, despite the fact she reached puberty.In the first film she even has a short encounter with a boy in the finale. No such thing in the sequel and no love interest at all.As a result all those extra emotions are not fully explored like in the first film. I'd say the first film explores the character of an elementary school kid in much more detail and more dramatically than the sequel does, when the character goes to middle school.Film would have been better with an age rating of 10 years.",6.0,petronius79,2024-10-05,1.0,0.0

1022789,No summary,"Inside Out 2 talks about ""growing up"" in an emotional way and depicts how growing up is challenging inside our thoughts. The film introduces the emotions we had from the previous movie: Joy, Anger, Sadness, Fear and Disgust. We are also introduced to new emotions: embarrassment, Ennui (boredom), Envy and Anxiety.Riley is about to go to high school but the story focuses on her preparation to officially join the FogHorn Hockey team. As the story progresses, Riley finds herself challenged with her hopes to join the team. Her friendship was wounded, her emotions went all over the place and the pressure got into her head. But eventually, everything goes into their proper places.This sequel film may be animated and made for kids but as an adult, it just hits differently. I can say that this film was partially made for adults and for anyone who is in a bad mental situation. It reminds its viewers how growing older can be tough, how overthinking affects everything else, how decisions that are made today may affect what's next. But it is also a strong reminder that problems, fear, worries and anxieties will come. They are all inevitable but everything will pass. Take a deep breath, stay calm and do not overstress everything. Having a calm mind also affects the way we think. We may feel pressure at any given time but we have to sit back and relax.Do not overstress things at the present. Live at the moment. The future is there but we live at the present, right here, right now. Enjoy life. Remember that you are not alone on whatever you are facing. Keep your friends and family close.

1022789,No summary,"Truth be told, I wasn't the biggest fan of the original. The 'mechanics' of how the emotions worked overwhelmed the human story of Riley (voiced by Kensington Tallman). INSIDE OUT 2 not only doesn't alter that, it seems to double down on it.The one potentially major shift is Riley's puberty kicking in. Unfortunately, by setting the entire movie in 3 or 4 days, there is little time to explore or expand on it. Instead, a few new Emotions get introduced including a frenzied Anxiety (Maya Hawke) and goofy Pouchy (James Austen Johnson). The overall effects is that parts of INSIDE OUT 2 play as even more juvenile than the first.The animation is good, as is most of the voice work, but, it's a missed opportunity. It's merely a direct sequel set two years after the initial movie. That it became the biggest animated feature in box office history (not inflation adjusted) says more about how current audiences crave the familiar comforts of sequels than anything else.Once all the chatter and clutter is set aside and Riley and her two closest friends, Grace (Grace Lu) and Bree (Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green), actually get a chance to have a scene together, it's a touching and heart-warming one.

1022789,No summary,"A lot of films that don't need them get sequels; Inside Out is that rare film that not only has the probability of a sequel written into its DNA, but with the deft execution of its idea genuinely earned a second outing. This second installment sees the centra character Riley hit adolescence, and with a raft of new emotions to add to the cast. The bones of the plot follow a similar structure to the first film - learning to assimilate and use 'difficult' emotions well. And whilst you can see that coming quite a long way off, it bears all the strengths of the first film - hitting its marks with open-hearted compassion, wit, and intelligence. It's genuinely laugh-out loud funny, much of what it says about adolescence is poignantly truthful - and applicable to much of the rest of life. Quite how far this franchise is an interesting question - young adulthood? Middle age? Old age? Are we heading for an animated Malone Dies style internal monologue for the final film? We'll find out - but for now, this is every bit as good as you hope it will be, more than earning its place in continuing to be an important source of thought provocation and conversation starting, not to mention as a general resource for coping well with life.

1022789,No summary,"This movie is good for kids and tweens/teens, but I feel like it's perfectly suited for parents. As a parent, I often wondered what in the world was going on with my young teens as they exhibited completely different personalities and behaviors than I knew them to be, and this movie explores that phase beautifully and imaginatively.I watched this with them (now in their 20s) and I had way more laugh-out-loud moments than they did, remembering those days (I have Nostalgia now lol). I thought Ennui was a great addition to the characters, and laughed every time she took over, remembering how annoying that phase was.I would love for one when Riley graduates, or even an adult and has a baby. New emotions come up all the time, especially during major life changes. I could see a future Inside Out when Riley has a baby and goes through the postpartum blues, and Joy, Anxiety and Guilt have a showdown.Overall, this one isn't as much a movie for little kids as much as it's for teens and parents, and if you go into it knowing that, it's amazing. If you watch it with your 6-year-old, the meaning is lost, but it's still enjoyable. The animation is still gorgeous, and the script is fun and fast-paced. I thought the new characters were introduced with sensitivity and nuance. Even though Embarrassment didn't have lines, and rarely touched the control panel, it's completely realistic that he was behind bringing back the old crew. In a conversation with my son, he revealed to me that he was often embarrassed of how he acted during this phase, but he was more embarrassed to be humiliated in front of his friends.",8.0,mandyrstrickland,2024-09-30,0.0,0.0

We missed it so much we didn't even realize it's essentially the same dish reheated. But don't worry, it's still tasty, especially if you loved the original. We reunite with Joy, Anger, and the whole crew-it's like catching up with old friends after 10 years: it feels good, even if there's not much new to talk about.Riley's a teenager now, so of course, there's drama. This is where Pixar throws in new emotions that crash in like annoying roommates: Anxiety, Embarrassment, Boredom, and Envy. And let me tell you, they create chaos in headquarters. Joy and the gang are overwhelmed, and things go off the rails faster than ever. If you've survived adolescence, you'll immediately recognize the mess.The formula stays the same: the emotions fight while Riley fumbles through life. But instead of getting lost in the mind's abyss like the first time, the old emotions are on standby. Meanwhile, the new ones take over, and guess what? They mess everything up, of course. Nothing groundbreaking, but it still works, because who doesn't love watching Joy try to keep things together while Anxiety loses it?Riley is now that girl you see in every middle school: going through an existential crisis over just about anything. One little shake-up in her life, and boom-it's a disaster in her brain. What's funny is that it all gets resolved in the end because, well, it's Disney-let's not go too dark. But that's why we're here, right? To see the characters struggle, but end with a heartwarming smile. A quick hug, and we're back on track.Let's be honest, Inside Out 2 is mainly a reminder of how much you loved the first one. We get all the ingredients that made the original a hit, but with a little less magic and a lot more of the same. But you know what? It works. We're not bored, but it's more of a reunion than a brand-new adventure. We could've hoped for more, but hey, we're not complaining too much.Inside Out 2 is like microwaving leftover pizza: you'd prefer it fresh, but it's still just as good, especially when you're starving.

Each emotion is allowed here to experience a range of actual emotions aside from the one they're named for, and that they primarily drive.Riley's journey throughout the movie is also pretty easy for most people to identify with even if they never played hockey, or any other sport really, when they were younger.

The climax doesn't make sense, really, the jokes are not consistent and funny,, the movie is so choppy and all over the place, it lacks the charm of the first film. While clearly being a rehash of the same plot. Pixar made a rule for its movies that they would never make a sequel unless it was as good or better than the original. Which with toy story two and toy story three, they certainly did. This movie is so far below the first Inside Out that it's a disgrace to the Pixar Legacy and represents what we have been seeing lately. That Pixar is not what it used to be. And that is so tragic, and it is so conspicuous, under similar management like Pete Docter and others who have been there for a while, that this movie deserves a 1 rating just to send a message that this movie is hack work by Pixar standards. I'm so glad I didn't watch it in the theaters, and waited to watch it on Disney+. That would've been even more painful. That this movie became the highest box office grossing animated movie to date is far more on the strength of the first movie, and the world being starved for a decent animated film lately, than the movie's merit.",1.0,frisco2007,2024-09-28,3.0,7.0

There should really be a male version of this movie where Reason shows up to bring all these emotions into line to create an orderly mind that utilizes these emotions as needed for positive ends. Sons watching this movie may be led to believe that emotions rule the mind which is surely true in this context, but would be misleading at best to young male viewers, and potentially damaging to their Patriarchal development. Now if the goal of this movie is to promote a movement to undermine the thousands year old reality of the supremacy of Reason and the process of maturity whereby emotions are subjugated to Reason, it is right on the mark.

1022789,No summary,I definitely understand why people say the sequel trumps the first film after witnessing it first hand. What the first film lacked the sequel made up for in spades. The biggest being the addition of 5 new emotions that were sorely needed from the get-go. They added a much needed spice and flavor to the story that made it that much more interesting and had me invested that much quicker. The jokes and humor I felt landed way more than they did in the first film as well. The casting once again were mostly solid choices although Mindy Kaling as Disgust and Bill Hader as Fear were missed. It's a shame that Disney couldn't pay them what they were worth to get them back for the sequel but I digress. It was still a very enjoyable movie that even had me tearing up the good old fashioned Pixar way in the end. Pixar returned to almost full form in this one for me and I can safely recommend it to just about anyone who wants a quick 90 minute piece of entertainment that's filled with laughs and some feels along the way.,8.0,psgorio,2024-09-26,1.0,0.0

1022789,No summary,"I am in my thirties and find myself overcome with emotion after watching this movie. I was a bit skeptical because technically the new emotions aren't emotions, they are more so feelings. These feelings are not to be neglected though and absolutely play a vital part into growing up. I didn't even know the word anxiety until I got into college and it was a big sigh of relief that there is actually a word describing how I am feeling and that I'm not some weirdo who is overthinking herself into yet another panic attack. The ending is what really won me over, I won't give it away, but even as an adult I wish I had a movie like this to turn to. Sure I read books, saw a therapist and had a support system, but this wrapped it up so nicely! Anxiety is scary, it can snowball and turn into panic attacks, paranoia and worse. It isn't inherently evil either, it's something you learn to live with. It is not you and you have more to offer. It's scary to be yourself and radiate confidence, but it will make life much more enjoyable and easier.

The script is tight, witty, and heartwarming, perfectly capturing the emotional complexity of growing up while maintaining a light, humorous tone.

The pacing of the plot keeps viewers, both young and old, hooked from start to finish. The film's ability to explore mental health and emotional balance with such nuance is impressive, and yet, it never feels preachy or heavy-handed.Unlike some other recent animated films (*ahem* Buzz Lightyear), ""Inside Out 2"" steers clear of unnecessary distractions. It sticks to what made the original great - emotions, humor, and heart - without throwing in any controversial themes or forced representation.

1022789,No summary,"Starting off, Inside Out 2 is as good as the first one. I find it does a good job at continuing the predecessor's themes of emotional health. It does that by introducing new emotions that come out after puberty. Though I could see the complaint about the new emotions is that we didn't see them in the adults' heads in the first one. That's something I like to see them explore in an Inside Out 3. No denying that they should make one after how good this one did at the box office and there's the room for a sequel. As well, I'm a big fan of completing trilogies
I liked how it expanded everything with the new emotions and the sense of self it introduced and it leaves room for further explanation in future entrees. I do like to see a series focusing on mental disorders like depression. Each episode focusing on a different disorder. Though that might have a harsher rating than TV-PG depending on what a certain disorder deals with.I still feel the emotional storytelling Pixar typically has. What I like about Pixar so much is they always seem to put some effort into their movies and has a layer or two of mature storytelling. Pixar doesn't have anything with a rating harsher than PG but it seems to be more mature than movies that have the harsher rating at times.That's at least why I like Inside Out 2 and even the first. I would recommend both Inside Out movies and like to see a Inside Out 3 down the line (so, Pixar, if you're reading this, start on it if you haven't already).",9.0,auskooper,2024-09-22,4.0,2.0
1022789,No summary,"The sequel to the first Inside Out is centered around the new emotion called Anxiety, who's easily taking over and starts controlling the teenager's life, which opens a new can of worms, and we are all eyes, watching how Anxiety deals with those. The emotion is shown as very energetic and willing to actively work its way into the girl's life in order to secure her safe future - an interesting, and not incorrect way to perceive anxiety. Additionally, new puberty emotions are introduced: embarrassment, envy and ennui (look who's the voice-over artist for that one!).

A film completely centred around the white experience at the expense of people of colour - let's start with the not-so-subtle stereotypical associations of negative emotions to voice actors who are people of colour with the positive emotions tied to white voice actors. Then to the plot where it's all about a white girl who harms non-white characters and then is comforted by the non-white characters she harmed. How ludicrous of a plot line is that?!?

The movie still had Pixar's signature charm, visually stunning with vibrant, imaginative scenes inside Riley's mind. The addition of new emotions, especially Maya Hawke's portrayal of Anxiety, was definitely a standout. She brought a fresh energy and quirkiness to the character, making Anxiety both chaotic and relatable. However, some of the other new emotions, like Envy and Ennui, weren't as memorable or impactful as the original crew.One thing I found a bit lacking was the humor. While there were still plenty of clever jokes, like the pun-filled ""Sar-Chasm,"" the film didn't feel as consistently funny as the original Inside Out. It relied more on familiar beats, and that initial surprise factor from the first movie wasn't there. However, the core message about growing up, handling anxiety, and navigating teenage emotions resonated well, even if the story felt somewhat predictable at times.

I'll get back to that.Inside Out 2 is sort of an ok sequel to a pretty good movie. I would have given it more marks, but then I'd had to redo my whole disney pixar rating thus far. My initial impression was that I didn't like it as much as I like other pixar movies, including the first Inside Out. When I thought about it though, I can't figure out why. If I were to come up with a sequel myself, I'd hardly do any better.The plot is about growing up, fitting in, changing suroundings. There are plenty of new concepts introduced and there are more than a few funny gags. As far as I can tell, the movie as a sequel does everything right. As I wrote that line, I increased the rating even further. If I'm being objective, I don't think there is much wrong with the movie, it just didn't quite spark as other pixar movies do. The only thing I'd point out is that Envy and Shyness don't get much to do in the movie. It is all about anxiety but then expecting to flesh out each character in such limited runtime would be difficult so I guess it was a good call to give Anxiety more room because it is indeed a major emotion when growing up.To the topic how the new emotions or lack there of in the adults is explained.

1022789,No summary,"Inside Out 2 has received widespread acclaim for its ability to build upon the original film's success while introducing fresh elements. Critics have praised the returning cast, including Amy Poehler(Joy) and Phyllis Smith(Sad), for their outstanding performances, and so have the new voices like Maya Hawke(Anxiety) and Hauser(Embarrassment).The animation quality in Inside Out 2 continues Pixar's tradition of visual excellence. The imaginative and detailed animation has been highlighted by The Guardian's Catherine Shoard, who remarked, ""Pixar's animation continues to dazzle with its imaginative landscapes and emotional depth.""
Talking about the new characters, they are amazing too, as Entertainment Weekly's Leah Greenblatt commented, ""The new emotional characters are visually stunning, adding a fresh layer to the world of emotions."" Moreover, the fight between Anxiety and Joy is funny, but at the same time, you can be really mad with Anxiety, like how we usually feel in real life.When we look at the movie's sound, Michael Giacchino's score was praised for its ability to complement the film's emotional beats, making emotional highs and lows beautifully, so the soundtrack became a memorable part of the movie (we can't get this song out of our minds when we left the cine).So, ""Inside Out 2"" it's a funny art production that will make all the family laugh, but also be impressive about the animation quality and be involved with the story. Although, more than great storytelling, the film had a great research work about designing the feelings, showing us how the feelings inside of us are, how they get stronger (and a little confused) when we are teenagers and how it's normal not to understand it (the same for parents who have children at this age).Because of all these things, we think it's the best animation of the year, and maybe over the last decades, since this movie is even better than the first one, which was already a great film, and It's an example of those movies that everyone can enjoy and get out of the routine.",10.0,miguelbertolezo,2024-09-14,0.0,1.0

But due to the lack of coherent structure, and the more ""free-hand"" approach, it didn't have as strong of an impact as other pixar or animated movies.

1022789,No summary,"Pixar strikes gold once again with Inside Out 2, a brilliant follow-up to its 2015 classic. Directed by Kelsey Mann, this sequel dives even deeper into the complexities of growing up, blending humor, heart, and profound emotional insight in a way that only Pixar can. While sequels often struggle to live up to the original, Inside Out 2 not only meets expectations but exceeds them, delivering a moving and resonant experience that will touch audiences of all ages.The film picks up with Riley now in her teenage years, a time of rapid change, heightened emotions, and new experiences. As her inner world becomes more complex, so too does the emotional landscape in her mind, introducing new emotions and greater challenges for Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), and the rest of the gang. The introduction of new characters, including the unpredictable Anxiety and the bold Confidence, adds fresh dynamics to the story, creating endless moments of hilarity and tension.One of the film's biggest strengths lies in how it explores the changes in Riley's emotional development. Where the first film focused on the transition from childhood to adolescence, Inside Out 2 tackles the turbulence of teenage life-relationships, identity, and the struggle to balance a whirlwind of feelings. The story is rich with metaphor, yet always accessible, making it a perfect mix of entertainment and deeper emotional themes.Visually, Inside Out 2 is a feast for the eyes. The vibrant animation brings Riley's mind to life with stunning colors, creative environments, and new areas of her brain to explore. The Imagination Land sequence, in particular, is a dazzling display of creativity and innovation that showcases Pixar at the peak of its artistry.The voice performances are stellar once again. Amy Poehler shines as Joy, delivering a performance that balances optimism with the growing complexity of Riley's emotions. Phyllis Smith's Sadness remains a standout, offering tender, heartfelt moments that anchor the film in emotional authenticity. New additions, such as Maya Rudolph as Anxiety and Auli'i Cravalho as Confidence, seamlessly blend into the ensemble, each adding their own unique flavor to the story.Another great film to watch!",10.0,GojoSoto,2024-09-13,0.0,0.0

Let's just say, that Disney has wasted their opportunity, and this is going to be the start of a downfall for Pixar as recently as 6 years ago. So like from the start they're making good movies that perform well and succeeded at the box office, and now it's getting worse, it's already becoming a box office failure for Pixar beginning during the pandemic almost every movies didn't make the cut to the box office because of a low budget and was underperformed on debut.

It was really original and something we never seen before by making our emotions having a personality and feelings. I watched that film so many times but I feel that's enough, I don't need to watch the film anymore. Now that the sequel came out, I watched it and man, not only it was wonderful, it surpassed its predessecor by a wide margin.Inside Out 2 was everything I ever hoped for a Pixar sequel. The new characters, Anxiety, Envy, Embarassment, Ennui and Nostalgia are all lovable (especially Anxiety & Envy). Great storytelling, relatable elements, etc.7.7/10 score is too low for this film, it should be at least 8.2/10. For me, this is the Terminator 2 of Pixar, where sequels surpass the originals in every way possible. It's on my top 2 favorite animated movies of all time along with Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse. I've seen a lot of the Pixar films, and Inside Out 2 is by far the best, yes way better than any Toy Story film.The first time I watched it was a day after my high school graduation, and the ending almost made me tear up.

1022789,No summary,"""Inside Out 2"" brings back the charming emotions from the original, but struggles to capture the same magic. The movie once again dives into the complexities of human emotions, offering a heartwarming yet familiar journey. This time, it explores the transition from childhood to adolescence, introducing new emotions and situations that are relatable for many.However, the film often feels like a rehash of the first movie. The emotional highs aren't as impactful, and the plot lacks the freshness that made the original so memorable. While there are moments of genuine emotional depth, much of the story follows predictable beats, and the humor, though charming, doesn't quite hit the mark as often.Visually, ""Inside Out 2"" is stunning, with vibrant animation and creative designs for the emotional characters. The voice acting is also top-notch, bringing life to the characters in a way that keeps the audience engaged.In the end, ""Inside Out 2"" is a decent follow-up, but it falls short of the emotional resonance and originality that made the first film a standout.

And the film itself was just not as good as I had anticipated.It was very lacking in new ideas and the dialog and new characters seemed like they were just a handful of cliches. I really hope that PIXAR learns from this experience, and does not produce a third Inside Out.

1022789,No summary,"Inside Out 2In this exciting sequel, puberty arrives, bringing with it a whirlwind of new emotions.Many will approach this film with one burning question: how will it measure up to its predecessor? This coming-of-age sequel skillfully honors the legacy of the original, weaving in beautiful callbacks while introducing fresh storylines, resulting in a truly captivating continuation.Bing Bong's sacrifice remains one of the most poignant moments from the original film, and while the filmmakers could have easily retconned his erasure, the tribute paid to his character in this sequel is beautifully done. The adventure the familiar emotions embark on is equally thrilling, with Anger, Disgust, and Fear bringing a dynamic energy to the journey. What truly shines, though, is the increased focus on Riley and her world. Her story is given equal weight to the emotions' journey, allowing for a richer exploration of the coming-of-age theme. The introduction of new emotions, Riley's physical changes, and the tough decisions she faces all contribute to this theme, creating a layered story. Although Riley's parents take a backseat to her developing friendships, the film still touches on the delicate balance parents must strike in guiding a teenager through this turbulent time.Where the first movie centered on Joy learning the importance of Sadness, this sequel dives deep into the impact of Anxiety and the turmoil it creates when it overwhelms. The film also explores the importance of accepting negative experiences and memories as essential to shaping a balanced person. It emphasizes that, no matter how much we try to bury them, these memories will inevitably resurface, and the only way to truly move forward is to face them head-on.Watching Riley spiral further and further was very taut but the conclusion is truly rewarding as she ultimately regains her sense of self, her true self-one that isn't dictated by her meddling emotions. It's a powerful moment where Riley reconnects with who she truly is.On a technical level, Inside Out 2 excels across the board. The visuals are breathtaking, the score perfectly complements the story, and the voice cast delivers outstanding performances. Newcomers, particularly Ayo Edebiri and Maya Hawke, shine alongside the returning cast, with Hawke's portrayal of Anxiety standing out as pitch-perfect.Creating a sequel to a masterpiece like Inside Out was always going to be a challenge, but Inside Out 2 rises to the occasion with commendable success.8.5/10.",9.0,exceladeogun,2024-09-03,0.0,1.0

I was a little bit suspicious before watching it and at the end of it I was moved and satisfied. After reading a little bit about it and let the information fall down it disappointed a little bit, but still remained a great sequel, that stands by itself and even leaved the door opened for a third part. Even for me, as a viewer.It has a lot of conceptual problems, like regarding the internal logic of this world, that is existing inside Riley's head and mind. A lot of questions that will be remained unanswered for the rest of the movie and for the rest of this franchise. A lot of choices that cannot explain why this movie was made for except money purpose.But there are a lot of great ideas that this movie is tailing on, regardless to incomplete conceptual writing. Its touches the grown audience and still manages to communicate with its younger audience, on a basic level, though it doesn't find the way to keep everything very simple.Anxiety's character is an anachronistic character - so inaccurate and even farfetched, but for several critical stages of the movie, it has a lot of elements that are pretty damn précised. It is a movie that is so hard for judging as an adult, if you cannot even try to reflect from the child's perspective. It has a lot, but sometime it feels it over the top and has nothing.It has a wild mind and great animation and imagination. Leans heavily of it's first movie success and concepts, but still stands by its own.

1022789,No summary,"I gave the original Inside Out a 7, but this one gets a 9. I think this has more to do with me being an adult watching these films than anything else. But there's more to it than that.The original Inside Out really capitalized on its very original and very fun concept, of each emotion being a little creature inside of your head, and the brain being this construction operation inside the mind of a child. And while the concept and the way it presents different ideas (long term memory, music that gets stuck in your brain, primary interests and passions being their own separate islands), I feel like the story and its overall message was a little flat.Inside Out 2, on the other hand, continues the amazing world-building of the first one, builds onto it, but also delivers an amazing story of not just growing up, but accepting yourself, for all your flaws, and learning self-love. That is an amazing message and, in my opinion, adds another layer to the film that the first one just lacked.This is especially true for someone like myself (and millions of others) who suffer due to their anxiety and lack of self-love. The solution of this movie is simple, yet it's one we rarely think of. I really wish I hadn't ticked ""No"" on the ""Does this review contain spoilers?"" but I would be doing a major disservice to your if I'd tell you what it was.The movie is creative, but despite the incredible imagination that is present in both the first and second movies, it's the sequel's heartfelt message that makes it better than the first one.You actually relate to a 13 year old girl who loves hockey (even if you're the farthest thing from that) and you understand the struggle that goes through her head. It really does hit you where it hurts and you learn something about yourself too.It's still got a few corny jokes that I wasn't fond of, but when the movie needs to be serious, it delivers a masterful message that few films that are ""made for adults"" could pull off.Make sure you watch this one, as it can really teach you a lot about self-love and accepting yourself for who you are, flaws, strengths, and all.",9.0,Alex_Mikael,2024-09-01,0.0,1.0
1022789,No summary,"This follow up to the rather excellent Inside Out picks up once again with Riley and her internal struggles, manifested as animated emotions. This time however, Riley becomes a teenager... and with her struggle to fit in and impress with her dream high school ice hockey team come a whole new range of complex emotions, including Anxiety, Envy and Embarassment. Cast out of Riley's core consciousness after being declared 'old hat' and 'too basic', Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust need to find their way back to Riley's control center before Anxiety causes a catastrophic meltdown...The first Inside Out was brilliant. It was well crafted, funny, heart warming, charming and generated it's fair share of a tear or two. This sequel may.. just may... be even better. It was a brave decision to try and tackle the subject matter of the teenage mind, but Pixar have absolutely nailed it. The new emotions are great, the dual story going on with the real world and inside Riley's mind is expertly woven and complex without feeling convoluted, and the film perfectly balances it's humour with relatable situations, urgency and emotion. Everyone will relate to aspects of this story, whether it being the overwhelming pressure of growing up, the frustration of being the parent of a teenager, or even the fear of being replaced at your job and fighting to get it back. Also, ""get back in the cupboard Nostalgia, we don't need you yet!"" Ahahaha, brilliant!I have to say that this film is amazing, and is perhaps the best film Pixar have made in the last decade.

1022789,No summary,"""Inside Out 2"" is a disappointing and underwhelming sequel to the original film's creative and scientific brilliance. While the first movie was emotional and deeply meaningful, this sequel lacks a profound message and falls short of the original's potential.The film introduces a new set of emotions as Riley enters puberty and experiences more complex feelings. However, the storytelling is slow and lacks depth, with large chunks of the narrative feeling stagnant. The audience is unable to connect with the characters, despite the excellent voice acting and animation.One of the main issues with ""Inside Out 2"" is its failure to explore the impact of these new emotions on adults. In the mid-credits scene, we see a brief appearance of Anxiety in Riley's parents' emotions, but it is unclear why these emotions are not more prominent. Are they being suppressed or hidden away? This contradicts the film's message that emotions are universal and inherited and that understanding and embracing all our emotions is crucial for positive well-being.Furthermore, the portrayal of Riley's emotions as different genders is confusing and raises concerns. While it has been speculated that this could reflect Riley's evolving sense of self and gender identity, it is unclear why the emotions in her parents' heads conform to traditional gender norms.

While it was commendable that 80% of the cast consisted of ethnicities other than white, the film could have pushed further to reflect the full spectrum of global diversity. We all know ice hockey is a sport enjoyed by all diversities (duh), which is why I expected more from this movie. The absence of representation for various ethnicities, transgender individuals, and even otherworldly or non-human beings limited its potential. The inclusion of characters from different dimensions or species could have added a unique layer of inclusivity and imagination.

Somehow I remembered that I enjoyed the movie, it was smart about describing emotions and it was a good film for children to understand themselves. Luckily, I have IMDb and I was surprised to see that I scored it a 6! I hated the film! I felt insulted by it. So how come I remembered it differently?Almost 10 years later I am watching the sequel and ... I liked it more than my wife did. Which is not saying much, because she didn't like it. Everything was terribly strident and the behavior of the emotion characters weren't representative for that emotion most of the time, only in choice moments. But I didn't hate this one. I thought it was OK.Surprisingly back in 2015 and now in 2024 is how little sexuality was scrutinized. If there was a hint in the original, in this one it wasn't even mentioned! She was supposed to be ready to be a college student! Which is ironic, since the whole premise of this sequel is that we should be honest with our experiences and learn from them all, without picking and choosing which one we think are appropriate for our growth.Bottom line: most of the film did not really have a psychological equivalent, and that was its biggest flaw.

Things get out of hand, there is a lot of arguing, one begins to wonder if it's true that people only have one positive emotion in the head competing against tons of negative ones (probably) and, like the first movie, you get two great, dual track stories, one of the girl, one of the emotions in her head.But one thing bugs me - anxiety.Anxiety in this film is very strategic, and I'm not sure that's what anxiety is. I feel they need two emotions, anxiety and ... cunning? Planning?

She is simply acting out what she's seeing in screen. But, I've now had to overly explain that she is simply repeating things from a movie that she has watched when other people are around and hear her say that. It has been a good teaching moment for her and a good opportunity to explain some big and different emotions and how they can be difficult to process.

1022789,No summary,"""Inside Out 2"" is one of those rare films that leaves you feeling understood, reminding you that you're not alone in experiencing complex emotions.The movie brilliantly captures the ups and downs we all face in life, portraying them in a way that feels both relatable and comforting.What makes it even more remarkable is its ability to resonate with viewers of all ages. We watched it with a mixed group, from children to adults, and everyone connected with it on some level.The film balances humour and wit with deeply heartfelt moments, making for an emotional yet uplifting experience. As a sequel, it succeeds spectacularly, continuing the legacy of the first film while adding new layers of insight.It's a beautifully crafted story that delves into the intricacies of human emotions while still being accessible and enjoyable for all. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a movie that's as thoughtful as it is entertaining.",10.0,AlexKrenshaw,2024-08-24,3.0,8.0
1022789,No summary,"The original Inside Out came with a lot of originality, it was a clever and unique tale of a young person's mind and one that both adults and children could access and enjoy. Being a sequel, Inside Out 2 had to find originality elsewhere, mainly in the travails of puberty and the new emotions that are introduced into the mix.And there is enough that is new in Inside Out 2 to make it a worthwhile watch, whether you are a teenager or an adult. But I did leave with the feeling this film could have gone so much further. Perhaps there will be an Inside Out 3 where the filmmakers take a bit more of a risk? As Harry Potter grew up, the maturity of his story also evolved. The same cannot be said of Inside Out 2's Riley, and it is ultimately just a saccharine revisit to the insides of someone's head.",7.0,GabrielSymes,2024-08-24,2.0,3.0
1022789,No summary,"With 'Inside Out' being one of my all-time favourite animated movies, I kinda knew 'Inside Out 2' wouldn't be as good. While it is still a good movie, it unfortunately falls way short of its predecessor...as expected.'Inside Out 2' once again follows Riley, now 13 years old and reaching puberty. Joy, Fear, Sadness, Disgust, and Anger are back at Riley's Headquarters. Growing up, off course, allows for more emotions, hence there are new emotions at Headquarters: Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, Boredom - with a guest appearance by Nostalgia, although a bit premature!Riley is playing hockey again and goes to hockey camp, where she befriends other girls. The film illustrates the need for teenagers to be cool. I must be honest, a film about teenage girls playing hockey is not exactly a premise I find interesting. I also didn't feel the emotions as well as I did in the original film, and there is no emotional depth here. I related so well to 'Inside Out', but 'Inside Out 2' feels as if it is aimed primarily at a young female demographic. There are also cartoonish humour, which the first film didn't have.I don't want to sound too critical, because it is still good enough as a standalone film. It's just not as good (for me), and definitely not as touching or memorable.",5.0,paulclaassen,2024-08-23,5.0,3.0
1022789,No summary,"If I want to summarize the message of this unique movie, ""It's okay if you're a good person and sometimes you feel anxious or selfish or sometimes kind or sometimes you're not good enough or brave and afraid and..."" These are all aspects of our personality that make us who we are and we love them all.I really enjoyed watching this movie, but it must be said that it was not as great as the first movie. The world of Inside Out had and has a lot of potential for screenwriting, but what we saw here was a mediocre spin-off of a masterpiece. In some places you ran out of ideas and waited for something more exciting, funnier or even more informative to happen, but there was nothing to offer.Yes, ""anxiety"" may take control of all our thoughts for a while, but not in such a way that ""joy"" and other basic emotions completely disappear. In two places of the film, the feeling of ""nostalgia"" was unveiled, which was not at all known for its use in adulthood. Maybe it's a preview of the planning of the third movie or something else...I enjoyed watching it, but at least not to the extent of the massive media coverage and record-breaking sales.",8.0,hossein_,2024-08-23,1.0,2.0
1022789,No summary,"Some people here called this movie uninspired or repititive etc. And liked the first part better... you do not know how much this movie resonates with someone who really suffers from anxiety. The rush to predict all possible incomes at all times, to set preventative measures for every option possible that may or may not happen, every single mishap being the end of the world, and a great representation of a panic attack was just painstakingly true. I just wished it was as easy as it was in the movie to deal with anxiety and panicking. I also loved the vault and the old crushes and little easter eggs here and there.

1022789,No summary,"I have always hesitated (as I do now) to say a movie is ""the best"" of anything, but I can say this is the best animated movie I have ever seen.That doesn't mean there aren't other ""the bests"" out there. I'm sure there are equally good animated movies. But this one touched my heart in so many ways.I understand there are diverse tastes and people have different opinions, but how this Pixar film doesn't have solid 10-stars straight across the board is beyond me. One person wrote, ""It's just not funny."" Not all animation is intended to be funny, by any means. I still laughed at parts of this, but this intended to tell the story of the changes that occur during formative years, not be a laugh riot. Another person wrote, ""It's just like the first movie!"" But we all know if it hadn't been, they'd have been complaining about it being totally different from the first film. Right? A third parson wrote, ""Anxiety is more important and takes over Joy?"" If you've ever had a panic attack, or been depressed or worse... you'd understand exactly how that can happen-- especially during inexperienced teen years. People don't have nervous breakdowns or even take their own lives because Joy rules everything.No need address similar negative comments, but I will mention that a movie isn't made to cater to individual whims or personal thoughts of what the plot SHOULD be. When we watch a movie it's good to open our minds to what's being presented and the purpose behind it, not try to shove our personal bias into the storyline-- 'cos that's just not going to work. Some of the low-star reviews indicate simply that the reviewer needs to switch their viewing choices. (One just has to wonder how some viewers think.)Perhaps some have never gone through the anxieties of teen years and just sailed through. I knew a man once who had never been depressed in his entire life, and just took it for granted it was a real thing. Perhaps those people would have difficulty identifying with this movie. But at the same time, the majority of us identify with the main character all too well.The animation is great, of course (it's Pixar). The character development is terrific-- even though they were dealing with LOTS of characters. (If that all seems jumbled at times... welcome to the world of human emotions. I have to believe that was intentional.) The main plot and story line is absolutely awesome from beginning to the post-credits end. But seriously, how can anyone not identify with the main character? Have any of us not gone through the trauma of teen years and the changes they bring in our life? If not, you were extremely lucky. Or maybe some didn't learn early lessons that are greatly needed in later life.There are so many good lessons and observations in this film, but I'm taking the ""no spoilers"" route here. I'm just going to say Pixar hit it out of the ballpark with this one, several times. This is one of the best flicks I've ever seen, with great messages for children, teens and adults alike. I don't see any way they could have done better.P. S: I really loved the ""sarcasm"". Saying nothing more... but what a brilliant idea. ;D.",10.0,Snootz,2024-08-22,0.0,5.0
1022789,No summary,"I loved the first film Inside Out (2015) with its creative premise, good humor, nice animation, and likable characters, so I have been wanting a sequel to it because it could introduce more emotions, explore more of Riley's life as she grows up, and bring more creative and interesting topics to the premise; nine years later we get the sequel, and after watching it, I can say that I loved it as much as the first one. The sequel Inside Out 2 (2024) was a funny and emotionally fun time with excellent voice acting, relatable topics, creative visuals inside teenage Riley's mind, great new emotions, wonderful animation, and serious topics involving how teenagers see themselves or think about themselves; what I liked about the film is that there is no villain in this, the antagonist would be anxiety and how teenagers when growing up try to deal with it, which I can relate to a lot.Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust voiced excellently by Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, Tony Hale, and Liza Lapira were once again likable characters who are just trying to take care of Riley any way they can, so them dealing with new emotions in now teenage Riley was entertaining to watch; Joy learning how she cannot be relied on all the time was interesting, and the way she goes through a new development is investing and emotional to watch, especially when the person they control might not want that emotion any more. The rest of the main emotions like Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust were funny and I like that they go the adventure this time through Riley's mind unlike the first film, along with not just joy but them also having layers of emotions of sorts too making them interesting and likable and not all one note. Lastly, the new emotions Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, and Ennui voiced great by Maya Hawke, Ayo Edebiri, Paul Walter Hauser, and Adèle Exarchopoulos were all likable characters that all had something to do with how teenagers tend to act, not only making them relatable characters but also funny and adorable to watch.The main new emotion I liked the most was Anxiety voiced great by Maya Hawke, because though she is the antagonist of the film, she is not intentionally trying to screw up Riley and instead is trying to help her without knowing she is hurting her; she was relatable to me and the way they show her over analyze things, make Riley do awkward stuff, and make her think of bad scenarios in her head was creative and I liked the visuals of it. The film was funnier than the first and the animation was phenomenal, but what I like the most was the serious topics it would handle involving how anxiety can affect you, how you try to impress certain people, how you try to make friends, and just overall trying to fit in; the film was creative on how it shows what Riley thinks of herself, how the emotions can effect it, and how anxiety can affect it to make you like yourself less. Lastly, other than the funny moments and callbacks to the first film, this film had emotional moments that were highly effective and made me cry while watching, that is because of how relatable the subject matter was and how realistic it felt making it very investing to watch.The sequel Inside Out 2 (2024) was a funny and emotionally fun time with excellent voice acting, relatable topics, creative visuals inside teenage Riley's mind, great new emotions, wonderful animation, and serious topics involving how teenagers see themselves or think about themselves; what I liked about the film is that there is no villain in this, the antagonist would be anxiety and how teenagers when growing up try to deal with it, which I can relate to a lot, but also that this character is just trying to help without realizing she is hurting the person she is controlling. I would not mind for them to make a third film because I want to see more of Riley's life and how it changes through time; this film was a return to form for Disney Pixar with them making an excellent sequel to an excellent first film that came out nine years ago, using new and relatable topics, which is why I highly recommend giving this a watch if you loved the first.",9.0,MB-reviewer185,2024-08-22,0.0,3.0

I loved the Joy character, and at one point she dances-she's so fun to watch! I wish the nostalgia old lady character had more screen time; maybe she will in the coming sequels. I'm glad they made anxiety the villain of the story-it really is. I would have loved it if Joy had beaten anxiety with a stick, but anyway, it's a super fun, high-quality movie, maybe even better than the Toy Story franchise.

1022789,No summary,"The first Inside Out was charming in presenting a moral tale showing how ""sadness"" acts in a person's emotional retinue to facilitate empathy and regret. I was intrigued with how the writers would deal with the potent emotion of lust in its dawn of puberty. The blank canvas promised much. Well that was the original script. Then Disney execs meddled. Overcome with a conflict of the Disney fantasy of life with reality they expunged ""lust"" from the story. And it shows. Imagine Lust being the villain instead of Anxiety, who is rightfully Lust's companion. The finished film has been gutted and it doesn't ring true. It's obvious something is missing. Lust's substitute is ennui - a clever substitution of names for Boredom. Anyone with more than a passing acquaintance with children, know they get bored from about age 2 - it's not something that comes along in puberty and it's arguably not an emotion.",2.0,greygalah,2024-08-22,12.0,6.0
1022789,No summary,"OK, first let me say it's not a BAD movie. This isn't anything like Cars 2 or something. It's a decent enough movie, but it doesn't stand up well against the original.The beginning setup is fine, but they're setting it up to finally get that puberty alert going. And when they do, it's a letdown. The entire movie had NOTHING to do at ALL with that aspect of growing up, other than one small aside about her pits smelling one morning.The movie centers around friendships, and the worry in transitions between grade school and high school, fitting in and making new, different friends without having to lose the old. All a great potential storyline if done well, but the puberty thing was just wasted in this context.Whereas in the first movie we really had empathy and liked the characters inside her head, this time around there's not nearly as much of a connection to them. It's as if they tried to just do too much and kind of overwhelmed themselves trying to keep all the balls in the air. They did, but they didn't really do enough with each ball to make the effort worthwhile in the end.Granted, the complexity of someone growing up mentally compared to them as a child is somewhat represented here, but again, it seems they tried to cram too many things in, and none of them were really fleshed out well enough to satisfy...So they made a decent effort, and it's a decent film, but it's not at all the emotional rollercoaster that I've come to expect from Pixar, and it doesn't captivate like they used to be able to do.",5.0,jdthird,2024-08-21,3.0,3.0

1022789,No summary,"This film focuses on Riley as she experiences the challenges of puberty while attempting to gain the approval of ""the cool girls."" Although it is well-crafted, it was somewhat frustrating to observe the reliance on clichéd tropes. I had anticipated a more nuanced and emotionally rich portrayal of Riley and her feelings, but unfortunately, that expectation was not met.The narrative appeared to be a disorganized jumble, lacking the intricate world-building that made the original film so compelling. There was no significant character development from the first installment; the plot essentially revisits the same lessons learned by both internal and external characters previously. Additionally, shifting the emphasis from family dynamics to a trivial hockey camp diminished the stakes considerably.In my view, the film felt tedious, aimless, and less enjoyable. The changes in voice actors were disconcerting, and the new characters seemed largely unnecessary and poorly integrated. Anxiety could have simply been portrayed as a new form of fear, while embarrassment might have been better represented as an aspect of disgust. Introducing a character that does not embody a genuine emotion felt misplaced.I sensed a lack of clear direction throughout the film. By the conclusion, my concern for Riley had diminished compared to my feelings at the outset.The ending was somewhat disappointing and felt inadequate. It raised questions about why Riley was selected for the team when the coach had previously deemed her unprepared before the scrimmage, only for her to validate that judgment through brash, aggressive, and selfish behavior. This seemed like a missed chance to illustrate Riley's confrontation with rejection and to showcase her character development throughout the film.In summary, while the movie is watchable, it appears that I may not have been its intended audience, as many viewers have expressed positive opinions.",5.0,panta-4,2024-08-21,6.0,6.0

1022789,No summary,"I am honestly surprised at seeing the amount of high ratings of 9s and 10s in the reviews making me question if we watched the same film or not.Maybe I'm getting old and I'm not the target audience of these kinds of movies anymore, or maybe I was just too sleepy when watching this, but unlike the first one, I did not like this one much. It is not insultingly bad or anything, after all, I'm giving it an above average rating.This movie compared to the first doesn't have the soul and emotional connection you'd expect. This movie in my opinion is just another unnecessary sequel solely made for grabbing cash, and cash grab it did.The first problem with the movie is the pacing. The story is incredibly rushed even though it has the same runtime as the first, so it's weird how everything feels like needed more time to develop, while everything in the first felt adequate and enough. The addition of the new characters definitely needed a lot more time.At the same time, nothing that interesting happened here in my opinion, and made the whole thing boring for me. The sense of exploration of different parts of Riley's mind from the first movie is gone and the film is more focused on the real-life story, so the whole Joy and the gang going through the mind is just that, a simple road trip story. Nothing interesting or of note happens there. I don't remember a single scene in this movie that stood out to me as interesting or creative at all, while I still remember Bing Bong, them going through that train station or room that changed their animation style, the scene of them messing with Riley's dreams and many more.Just so much happened in the first film that it feels like that movie was over 2 hours. But I just did not find a single scene in this movie note-worthy.The next problem for me is that I just don't care about these characters here, especially the new ones. There is no emotional connection, unlike the first movie. The real-life struggles of Riley in the first film were more relatable and the whole Joy realizing Sandness is necessary and the Bing Bong storyline were the soul of that film and made you actually care and have an emotional connection to them. This is nonexistent in this sequel.It doesn't feel like they had an idea for a story and decided to make a movie about it, it feels more like a studio-mandated sequel that they tried to come up with a story afterward. The plot of this movie is so boring and so few things happen here that it feels like I'm watching Inside Out: The Series and just watching a random episode where Riley needs to get on the cool hockey team.I understand that someone would like this, especially the younger generation, but what I don't get are the 9s and 10s, because this is so obviously and clearly inferior to the first film in many aspects that I don't understand how someone can say this is on the same level or even better than the first!Overall, the movie is not that bad if you don't have anything better to watch, but I am disappointed that this movie did nothing for me after going in having seen the high ratings and the reviews. It is an example of an unnecessary cash-grab sequel. Inside Out is one I consider one of Pixar's greats and will rewatch it if I feel like it because it's a really enjoyable, deep, emotional, innovative, creative, and beautiful film. Very rewatchable.

1022789,No summary,"Do you think this movie is better than the first part, for me, it lies in between. Riley is a teenager with welcoming new emotions in it. More Anxiety, less Joy. They have gone through depth.Starting with the story, headquarter get new emotions and old emotions got worried about that. Going with flow, how Anxiety shows its dominance kicking out Joy with others takes over Riley to her control. Yes everything Anxiety does, most things are true. I'm glad they have focused on that more. But Joy with her teams tries their best getting Riley back on the tracks.Now what I talk about lies in between. My point is throughout the movie most of the screen play they have shown Anxiety motives, tense about the future and all that. What I'm saying is what about other emotions. In the first movie, they gave a nice screen play introduction to the very emotions they got but here it was missing. There are more points but I don't want to talk because of spoilers. Animation I need not to tell. It's the Pixar studio. It's great and beautiful.Concluding, really this movie has very good messages which I won't answer here.

The film deserving of a sequel is Inside Out, which is an already incredible film. It does show Riley growing up as a teenager and all the self-doubt and anxiety that comes with it. Now thinking about it, I wonder how they'll go further and make a third installment in high school or even later because that'll be interesting. Anyways, the hugest positive of this film - like most Pixar films - is delivering a relatable story that both adults and kids can enjoy. That's something that I love about Pixar so much. This is one of the most well-timed films they ever made which is saying a lot. There's going to be an argument of ""this doesn't bring anything new."" To an extent, it doesn't and they should mix it up a bit. With that being said, this is a fantastic film. The animation is gorgeous and terrific which is to be expected from Pixar. The returning voice cast is great. However, the new voice cast is the standout particularly Maya Hawke as Anxiety. Riley is fleshed out more and is now in control of her emotions in the end in a sense.

If in the first Inside Out film, the theme was about toxic positivity and how harmful it can be to mental health, in this second film, the theme is about excessive anxiety, which ends up leading the protagonist Riley to suffer the attack of panic.In short, the first film is about accepting that sadness is part of our lives and the second is about learning to control anxiety and not let it dominate us.In some points, I still think the first film is better than the second, but I can say that the positive point of this film was seeing Anger, Fear and Disgust stand out more than in the previous film, and dealing with a very important theme, which is precisely about the excess of anxiety.",10.0,lucasbarbosadesouza2,2024-08-14,0.0,2.0
1022789,No summary,"After box office flops of 'Lightyear', 'Elemental', and direct to Disney+ features, people were reporting on ""the death of Pixar"". The along comes 'Inside Out 2', and it makes over 1.5 billion dollars, the highest grossing animated film of all time. Sound familar? Back in 2015, 'The Good Dinosaur' and 'Monster's University' underperformed critically and financially people were reporting on ""the death of Pixar"". Then along comes 'Inside Out' and made 850 million dollars and won Best Animated Feature Oscar. Deja Vu.Categorize this as one of Pixar's good sequels. The characters and worldbuilding progress in a believable way. It teaches a good lesson in a unique way. Like all Pixar films, it is well animated and has great music.I was initially concerned going into this film. Instead of Pete Docter directing it is just a Mann, probably doesn't even have a doctorate. And they even replaced two of the voice actors of the original 5 emotions. The new VA's do a good job, but the lack of continuity did bother me.This movie does some parts better than the first, and other parts worse. In total, it evens out to be just as good as the first.Starting off with the parts that this one does worse than the original. The inciting incident that gets the adventure going feels more abrupt in this film. Things just escalate too quickly. The way the problem is solved on the inside does not feel as earned as the first. And in general, the concluding scene does not hit as hard as the first.Ending with the positives, the story with Riley is more interesting in this one. In this film, the adventure that the emotions go on is more connected to the (forgive the pun) emotional journey. And overall, this one was just funnier than the first.No need to feel so anxious about this one, this film delivers joy to the viewers.",8.0,JayWolfgramm,2024-08-14,0.0,1.0
1022789,No summary,The story was interesting but maybe one piece worst than first movie. Original movie from 2015 has a emotional scenes this maybe too serious and humour scenes. Again i tell you this movie is very good but the first one was fantastic this is just very good. My favourite emotion Anger was the best again in 2 in a row movies. I think it will be third movie but if this movie is the final one it will be okay. Guys go with your kids or girlfriends or family you will be enjoy i swear. I watch it with my girlfriend she enjoy it very much. Inside Out 2 was one of the best animation movies of this year.,8.0,hristokasabov,2024-06-20,1.0,1.0
1022789,No summary,"This film is the sequel to the 2015 feature Inside Out, and follows the emotions inside 13-year-old Riley's mind as they help her navigate her life. As she transitions into a new stage of adolescence, four new emotions-anxiety, envy, embarrassment, and ennui-arrive and start to change Riley. At the same time, she is at a hockey training camp, preparing for high school. While there, she makes new friends and strives to join her dream team, the Firehawks. The old and new emotions have different views and methods on how best to help her, and because of this disagreement, the new emotions exile the others. Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust must then journey to the back of Riley's mind to retrieve her discarded sense of self before she becomes unrecognizable. Overall, due to its signature beautiful animation, star-studded voice cast, perfect blend of humor and emotional beats, and creative world-building, this movie was great and well-constructed, and although it was not as good as the original and had a very similar story structure, I really enjoyed it, and think that it is an important picture for people who are going through similar experiences as Riley, as well as for adults who have had these experiences in the past, because it shows the complexities of human nature and how wonderful life is.",8.0,Dylpickle08,2024-08-11,1.0,1.0

I haven't watched the first movie and I wasn't particularly interested in it but I happen to have been near the cinema at the time and wanted to give it a go.It's not anything special, it's a regular kid movie but it's still got some things going for it that make it better than just that.I would've liked to see this movie as a kid because there's a lot of moments where the main character is completely embarrassed and does things that are unreasonable and the way the movie portrays it, especially with the little characters representing the main character's emotions, get the point across of how this is human and normal and why and how it happens. Even as a 21 year old adult it felt reassuring to see this little girl get in embarrassing situations and self doubt and overcoming all of this.If you have a kid I recommend you to watch it with them.

1022789,No summary,"To revisit the first film, I watched it again before seeing the latest one. Compared to the first film, I think the second one lacked some of the wow factor. The core theme remains the same: every emotion deserves attention. Joy is once again caught in self-reflection and eventually has an epiphany. I didn't find it particularly moving after watching. The portrayal of teenage anxiety is well highlighted, showing how changes in relationships contribute to uncertainty and fear about the future. The beginning connects with the motif from the first film.As an animated movie, it is quite standard, with no particularly poor aspects. The character development and color connections are very straightforward. The supporting characters are not as memorable as the first film's Bing Bong. The plot advances naturally without any standout elements. Some people online suggest that the lack of distinctiveness in the emotions is due to Riley still being in the exploration phase, but after watching the end credits of the first film, it's clear that children of Riley's age have unique emotional traits. So I think this online interpretation isn't entirely accurate.After much consideration on how to evaluate this sequel, my conclusion is that it is a film suitable for viewing at any time. The story won't leave you feeling sad or gloomy for too long, making it appropriate for all age groups. As for whether it's superior to the first film, I don't think so. It evokes some resonance but isn't particularly profound, possibly due to its teenage setting. I do appreciate the character design, as the details and main color scheme reflect the essence of the emotions.",7.0,jiany-22199,2024-08-03,0.0,0.0

1022789,No summary,I really liked the first 'Inside Out' movie as it talked about the importance and benefit of feeling the featured emotion 'sadness'. This movie however mainly just focused on the emotion 'anxiety' in a rather depressing way. As someone who has struggled with anxiety for years this movie was triggering and did not seem encouraging.I think they missed a great opportunity to talk about anxiety in a way that is encouraging to teenagers/young adults in a way that is educational and beneficial on how to overcome and deal with this feeling in a helpful way.There were also other emotions in the movie like envy or boredom which seemed useless to the storyline as these emotions weren't depicted very well either.,3.0,graceblakiston,2024-07-30,13.0,6.0

1022789,No summary,"Pixar used to be an infallible studio, one whose name exuded imagery of excellent animation and unbelievable storytelling. And while the film house has shown it can still make an absolutely amazing movie if it wants today, far more recently, it has faltered more than not. Mainly, the issue lies with Pixar sequels. The Disney subsidiary has become notorious for relying on sequels to almost all their IPs as opposed to the wonderful original films it used to churn out, and the reality remains that almost every single time, those sequels simply do not touch the original film in terms of quality. The comparison ultimately may not seem fair, and I would agree, but also succumb to the habit myself. The truth still holds that the original Pixar films present as masterpieces, and.juxtaposing the sequels with those originals will naturally occur. And while Inside Out 2 on its own could be considered a fantastic film, it simply does not hold a candle to the first one that released nearly 10 years ago.Inside Out 2 picks up the story of Riley from her puberty years.

The only problem I have with the movie, is that the ""inner joy"" characters for the young Black and Hispanic girls were white. That should have been caught before the movie was released. They should have been made to match the color of their skin on the outside. They could've had the same hairdo, the same face the same dress, but their color should have matched the color of their skin. They really should have made a concerted effort for the young Black and Hispanic little girls that were watching this movie.

1022789,No summary,"This sequel is a very well put together and thought out film, just as its origin film was. I like to think, despite not being certain, that the settings, the functions and everything related to the characters that represent the emotions were made in the image and likeness of the real physiological processes that a person goes through when experiencing such emotions in particular. If I'm right, this proves me right in saying that it's a well put together film. It's even possible to apply psychology to establish the dynamics between the same emotions.Now, speaking clearly of the story that the film presents to us, it's a bit weak, basic, simple and without much development. That being said, don't get confused, I understand why this is so. At the end of the day, this is an animated film for the whole family and it's not worth making a plot so complex with brain processes if in the end the purpose is to entertain. And yes, after 100 minutes, the film entertains, astonishes, excites and it's enough to fill a pleasant family afternoon.Good for Pixar, as it maintains the trend of making animated films within a complex framework that invites us to reflect, instead of just being pigeonholed into the well-worn plot of the princess who needs to be rescued or the hero on duty who saves the day.

1022789,No summary,"Whilst I do like a lot of Pixar films, I can't say that ""Inside Out"" was one that I was particularly enthusiastic about, or one that I was crying out for a sequel to. So, I avoided seeing this until it really worked out in a day with other films I wanted to see. That said, it's a really intelligent and articulate film about human experiences and mental health, though one that's not perhaps quite as funny as it ought to be.Riley (Kensington Tallman) is now 13 and her emotions are in balanced control, led by a core understanding of who she is. This is until puberty starts, bringing with it new emotions such as Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser), Ennui (Adele Exarchopoulous), Envy (Ayo Edebiri) and particularly Anxiety (Maya Hawke). As Riley goes to an Ice Hockey camp and discovers that her best friends aren't going to the same high school as her, these new emotions force out the old ones with Anxiety increasingly takes full control of her.On some levels, it's pretty much the same movie again as the first one, just with more complicated emotions that need to be accepted for Riley to become complete. I'd say this one focuses a lot more on the story that external Riley is having, which comes as a detriment to the internal plot that the ""classic"" emotions have trying to get back into the control room. It felt, in retrospect, like they were spinning their wheels a bit with that aspect of the story. The true articulate aspect is all in how anxiety takes over and begins to make wrong decision for the right reason and the visualisation of where that leads too.I didn't think it was particularly funny either, preferring the occasional pratfall or moment of violence over anything well-constructed or clever. I don't want anyone to come away with the impression that I thought ""Inside Out 2"" was bad, but I'd preferred both ""Luca"" and particularly ""Soul"" that I've seen at the cinema this year.",6.0,southdavid,2024-07-25,2.0,2.0

It explores the insecurities that one has growing up, and the change of the internal fundamentals of one's personality.The worldbuilding reflects this, fleshing out further the space of the mind. The new emotions are flashy, but it's the changes to locations established in the previous movie and new ones that really take the cake.The animation is much the same as the previous movie, except with hilarious additions of 2D and other styles for joke characters. The character designs are superb, and address the criticism often laid at the emotions' designs, since the new female emotions are just as wacky as the male ones.Overall, a solid recommendation.

1022789,No summary,"An extremely accurate portrayal of the awkward nightmare that is puberty. As someone who firmly believes sequels rarely match the original, this film comes surprisingly close. Of course, it lacks the original's conceptual novelty. However, the tumultuous and heartbreaking storyline, along with the introduction of new emotions, more than makes up for it. A unique addition is the concept of the 'sense of self' that is formed from memories as well as the all-too-familiar 'back of the mind' where Joy catapults memories she believes are detrimental to Riley. These additions allow for the expansion of the mind world that Pixar has developed. The film particularly appeals to people with a bit more life experience who may be able to relate more than most children. Be prepared for some 'I can't look it's too embarrassing' moments along with some tearjerking scenes that warrant a tissue or two.

1022789,No summary,"Making a sequel to a highly successful movie is already a risky business, letting 9 years go by until you actually release it, makes it 9 times harder and adds to the pressure of making it as good as the first or even close to it. Yet somehow they managed to create this masterpiece.The first Inside Out was already an amazing film, the entire concept of having a physical representation of your emotions and the subtext of the interactions between them, mimicking the real life feelings everyone one of us go through was brilliant.Even though it was an animated movie and of course also targeted for children I did find that due to its complexity and messages it was actually even more targeted to a slightly more mature audience including adults.So of course I was expecting the sequel to be good I didn't expect to be this emotional and amazing story with so many relatable moments and once again kudos to the outstanding creativity of the interactions between the depicted emotions, if you keep your attention throughout the movie it's mind blowing the amount of times the emotions relating with each other is a real life representation of our very own real feelings and struggles.I was close to shedding tears so many times and the fact that they always manage both in the first movie and in the sequel, to clearly depict how all of your feelings and emotions no matter how bad we think they are, serve a really important part in building your character its just beautiful.Inside Out is the type of animated movie that serves as the example of what real animation should be, fantastic production work, great sound, great voice acting but most importantly than all an inspiring and insightful lesson to everyone with of course a happy tone but with no less depiction of reality.I rarely say this but I actually hope they make a third, and I hope they make Riley an adult to wrap up this magnificent arc,",10.0,thePopcornExplorer,2024-07-25,1.0,5.0

I thought the varied animation styles fit really well and added some fun visual elements to the film. Riley's character model has certainly gotten an upgrade-she is too damn cute in this movie!!!That being said, this movie was less entertaining than the first. I felt that the catalyst of the film wasn't quite well explored and therefore difficult to invest myself in. Being that we don't know Riley's friends all that well and we remain trapped in a single setting throughout the film, it just felt a little contained for a film that should otherwise warrant a big adventure. The first movie definitely felt more big and moving.This sequel does just fine for itself. But I was expecting more out of this story and was hoping for more action elements or new, novelty artistic looks at the mind's inner workings.",7.0,yeswestan,2024-07-23,2.0,1.0

This resulted in bright images, especially the galaxy, projected by dual projectors on the giant scree which measures 16 meters high by 22 meters wide, It had a bit more pixels than I'd expect from IMAX Laser. The images are larger than life but also cropped due to the curvature of the screen. Although they don't confuse the eye but you will have a strain if you sit in the middle rows. Along with 12,000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!It had a lot of moments. I like the anxiety v joy balance.

It's missing most of the whimsical fun the first movie had, but it replaces that with an emotional depth which is simultaneously heavy and satisfying.

1022789,No summary,"Arriving almost a decade since Inside Out became one of Pixar's most beloved hits, Inside Out 2 has come at the exact right time to become both the summer blockbuster hit the industry needed and wasn't expecting while also showcasing after a number of lean years, Pixar still has the magic to make the films they became known for.Marking the directional debut of filmmaker Kelsey Mann, who has previously honed her craft contributing to films such as The Good Dinosaur and Onward in the past, Inside Out 2 is a big swing from Pixar that sees the Disney owned company explore the next stage of protagonist Riley's life as she morphs from child to teenager in what is an experience that is most certainly aimed at the maturing Pixar audience.It's a big gamble to examine puberty, anxiety, embarrassment, envy and self-beliefs amongst other sometimes taboo subject matters for children's entertainment but for the most part Mann and her team do an expert job of handling all these hot topics while also maintaining the same creativity and humour that made the 2015 original such a well-regarded outing.Bringing back key players such as Amy Poehler's Joy, Tony Hale's Fear and Phyliss Smith's Sadness proves once more to be a winner for the Inside Out brand but adding a great deal to proceedings this time around are new additions such as Maya Hawke's Anxiety, Adèle Exarchopoulos's Ennui and Ayo Edebiri's Envy who all bring the energy and creativity to their voice roles and help perfectly balance out the drama with the fun as Joy and her friends look to take back control of the Riley they know as she transitions to the next phase of her life.There's no doubt that there are moments here that are going to emotionally resonate and even devastate some viewers, much like the best Pixar films manage to do (here's looking at you Up, Toy Story 3 and Wall-E) but there's also plenty of time for fun and games as Inside Out 2 takes us to Hockey training camps, very different type's of chasms and storms and lots of witty banter between our mismatched gang of misfits, making this an all round animated experience that is sure to please fans of many different ages and backgrounds.In a gloomy time for Hollywood and cinemas, Inside Out 2's great critical, commercial and audience reception, making it quickly become Pixar's highest ever grossing film at the international box office to the tune of well over a billion dollars, is a good news story to savour and a timely reminder that after years of so-so outings, Pixar still has what it takes to make the special type of films very few can make for its target audience.Final Say -A powerful and important exploration of its many themes and subject matters that at same time never forgets to have fun, Inside Out 2 is a successful and enjoyable return to form for Pixar that will likely act as a key film for many children navigating the path to teenage/adulthood in the future.4 pieces of broccoli out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",8.0,eddie_baggins,2024-07-22,0.0,0.0

The first movie's story had much more of an emotional pull to me. And the new emotions, besides anxiety, only have some one off moments that didn't make their addition feel necessary.

This movie is a special kind of 10/10 that does both at the same time.

1022789,No summary,"Inside Out 2 once again brings its signature inner-emotions narrative that does a lot of good for ordinary (allistic) children and young adults; this time examining the flux of puberty and the developmental flood of notorious pubertal phase emotions; wanting to fit in and be validated, wanting to be accepted, feeling the need to become more independent from parents, or feeling anxious about starting a new chapter.The introduction of the distinctly teenage ""Ennui"", and Nostalgia is given cursorial attention as a source of comic relief. It's Pixar film-therapy for kids, and will no doubt help to provide some degree of emotional literacy for generations of children to come.Unfortunately, the opportunity to explore and delve into a much broader range of emotions, including more niche emotions, went amiss. The scope of the film could have been widened. Children or adults watching who are on the spectrum may find the film somewhat unrelatable, to some extent. It also does little to help viewers understand the emotions of those with other mental health conditions and neuro-types, which may dramatically affect things like their functional capacities for anxiety, empathy, joy, or information processing - which could be variably amplified, suppressed, or mixed up. I think helping allistic viewers to understand brains wired completely or largely unlike their own would have been the better angle to take.For those who don't or haven't suffered much anxiety, even as teenagers, this film once again may not speak to such types. The female teenage brain is famously nervous for many young girls and is this is well known to parents/guardians of young girls too, but that won't speak to everyone. Perhaps having a male character (her brother?) alongside Riley, living a parallel life, could have opened up the film to being more inclusive?The conclusion of the film provides a much-needed lesson on doing something out of a love for it - and for one's self; regardless of the outcome, it teaches some child friendly level of stoic outcome independence. To parse through life's challenges and tribulations emotionally soberly. To accept one's self alongside all the other emotions, and ultimately to manage one's own emotions in a fair and clear-minded way - not being guided by a predominance of any single emotion at the helm. On that message alone the film is laudable, even if some opportunities were missed to take these ideas to the next level.The emotional puns were at times great, but they completely missed the ""emotional rollercoaster"" gag. One can't help but think Pixar classics of the yesteryear were a bit more thoroughly and meticulously thought-out.7.4/10.",7.0,imaxxing,2024-07-17,1.0,0.0

And then with the input of new emotions showing the growth of humans and what changes for them. With some quotes from the film hitting hard, like when you grow up, you feel less joy, it was perfect. It almost puts picture to thought of the battle that goes on in your head when dealing with emotions. All emotions fighting to be seen.The actors used for the voices will still be the best choices made, sadness being my favourite with her voice being so perfect for the way i imagine sadness would talk.This film really gave me the nostalgia i needed, sometimes we are judged for going to the cinema alone, and as a 26M being in ""kids"" films really plays on my mind, but this film made me realise that being a kid i just had less emotions which is why life was happier, doesn't take away the fact those emotions aren't still prevalent.

1022789,No summary,"Let me start off by congratulating Pixar on yet another exhilarating achievement. Many people are wondering why they are having this kind of astronomical success at the box office. Simply put, millions of people out there were able to form a deep bond with the first film throughout the nine years following its 2015 release. Myself included, as the whole reason I created my imdb account that same year, was to drop a rate of 10/10 without ever even trying to justify it. Beautifully done worldbuilding by the legendary Pete Docter. Such a sophisticated film that will be talked about and praised through countless generations.Having said all that, let's discuss the possible reasons Inside Out 2 might not have stuck its landing the way a lot of fans of the original may have wanted to. Let's just be upfront about it: the rhythm and pacing this time around are not very good. To elaborate on that, the sequencing of events seemed to have been oversimplified to fit into the 90 minute runtime the Pixar team aimed for. Moreover, the overall product feels rushed, without giving the audience enough time to develop feelings and emotional bonds towards what is happening as the scenes unpack in real time. To describe it in the way I came out of the movie theater like: ""Man, is it over already?"" The movie doesn't take its time to make us care for what the Emotions or Riley are going through. Without getting into spoilers, I feel like the movie fails to convey the complex emotions the movie is based around, and after having watched the trailers, one can already picture the type of climax and the way the film expects us to get attached to the characters at the end. But don't get it wrong, this film still manages to evoke certain emotions (although not as strong as the ones evoked in the first movie), which is a Pixar guarantee at this point. But still, despite all of its efforts to connect with the audience, I felt a little detached when the credits started rolling.All in all, this really feels like a watered down version of what Pixar probably had in mind and due to the actors strikes and all those issues outside of their control, could have played a role in propelling this seemingly rushed product. Not trying to justify the movie's shortcomings, but you have to be fair when criticizing.Let's not fool ourselves, there are some brilliant elements that I feel like they barely scratched the surface on and I'm hoping to see them properly developed one day.It pains me, as I've always considered Inside Out (2015) my absolute favorite animated movie, and I know, you should never seek for perfection specially when it comes to sequels, but it still left me somewhat disappointed that it didn't receive the same level of care that the first one did.Overall 7/10

How could an animated film possibly capture the way the human brain and emotions work together while also telling a compelling story? Pete Doctor and crew pulled it off.

I can't tell you how many times we've referenced that film while parenting kids who are now teenagers. So we all went back to the theater for this one. There were still moments of magic, but the brain control board felt like an appropriate metaphor for this one: too many buttons, too many emotions crowding around it, too many things to explain.

1022789,No summary,"If the notion, or one can call it a theme if that sounds more palatable, of the first Inside Out was that not only can you be sad but, to be a complete person (especially when we are young), you should be sad sometimes and shouldn't repress that emotion, Inside Out 2 means to convey something that does what a sequel should do: a little familiar and a little different - chiefly with the ""Belief System"" and all the suspense that the re-forming and upending of that entails - and that the former doesn't negate the latter (sometimes, as maybe the climax is meant to be a reflection of in an un? Intentional meta way, you have to combine ""good"" with ""I'm not good enough"" to be... enough!)By this I mean you know that you'll be coming to a realization about what Anxiety is going to bring into Riley's life, which is chaos and uncertainty and insecurity (the word uncertainly especially and that giant board that Michael Stuhlbarg stands in front of in A Serious Man flashed in my mind once or twice), but the movie does bring enough depth to justify itself to be in the ballpark of the first movie and that story's immense insight. Unlike the first movie, which was more about childhood self-actualization, this is a *Coming of Age story, so it has to be about changes and how awkward and awful and just ::insert the UGGH face in a dozen permutations here:: it becomes.And while there are other new (enjoyable) emotions like Envy, Ennui and Embarassment (hey, three E's), Anxiety (an electrifying turn from Maya Hawke by the way) takes center stage as not really the antagonist but the conflicting force with the original five Emotions who are sidestepped into the corner of Riley's mind. The familiarity comes with it being a similar skeletal framework - characters far away from their place of dominance and must find a way back (but then again that's also pretty much all the Toy Stories as well) - but the entertainment value is in what the Pixar team does to play around and in this framework and that you just like these characters so much (and that includes, crucially, Riley... or, like is not exactly the word um... love? In a way?)But back to Anxiety. The Pixar writers and storytellers understand with a strong and even courageous intuition that there has to be a seemingly minor but extrenely significant shift this time around when it comes to this opposing ideology/Emotional framework here, and that has to be when dealing with (cue up Blink 182, or Bruce, whichever is your key) growing up. It's hard to do, it happened once again, you'll turn to a friend etc etc oy vey what a world oh what is sleep uh oh...You can't control the future, but you come to the point as a young person where it's not about feeling happy or sad in the moment (or, yeah, anger and disgust and a little fear always there sure); it's that there are the myriad possibilities of what will happen in your day and what will this person think of your hair or your taste in music and hey it's time to have new friends and screw the old friends and what about the game tomorrow oh no oh no oh....And so on. I make the film sound more devastating than it is as this is at heart still an adventure comedy with lots of hijinks and pop culture ribbing - this time with Dora the Explorer-esque buried memories and even a lame video game character (brilliantly done by the way with faded pixels that contrast with everything else in the film), and not least of which glorious Pouchey - and it is funny, probably Pixar's funniest since Toy Story 4.What impresses me is the thought and care put into the development and execution of these new emotions, and Anxiety is one of *those* Pixar characters (the list is too long dont get me started) where in lesser hands she/it would be a simplistic villain and here it is more about how she is herself so hyper-charged on everything that can go wrong and, as often happens in real life (believe me I know), Anxiety can make one do some very dumb and cruel and unjust things.Ultimately, Inside Out 2 doesn't fire on every cylinder like the first film, and needless to say there isn't anything as heart-crushingly profound as Bing-Bong, and that still doesn't stop it from being an important and meaningful movie. You can't totally get rid of Anxiety, and, while your mileage may vary, you shouldn't. And you won't fully be rid of the memories and pain that you'd rather forget from mistakes and doing wrong forever.If you're honest with yourself though (and, frankly, not a stone cold sociopath), Anxiety can be a part of your life without *defining* who you are and thst is, I think, what the filmmakers are going for here, and that's a powerful message for... anyone really. I'd even go further (and maybe this was on the makers minds) that a good/trying to be good person can't help but have this in their lives.Last but not least, real talk... this director and the writers, I bet they watched *a lot* of Nickelodeon's Doug, yes? OK, good.",9.0,Quinoa1984,2024-07-13,1.0,1.0
1022789,No summary,"Inside Out 2 was a really good film. Not really too much debate there. It was an appropriate continuation on the first film which explores more than the first, maintaining the charms of the world the first film built while expanding on the ideas. Therefore, it's worth a watch. That's the basic explanation.In more detail, the concept of the film and how it develops from the first is great. There was the obvious direction and they did it - Riley hits the scary wall that is puberty, as she leaves middle school and enters High School. As a result, the long-desired emotional stability of the first film goes out the window, and is replaced by anxiety, embarrassment and ""ennui"" (look it up it's just basically boredom). Riley finds her complex emotional makeup begins to redefine her values, and this all comes in a time of indifference for her, for other reasons which I feel spoil the concept of the film a bit more.The positives of this film are that the plot was excellent and the world building held strong. The film did go off the back of the fact you knew the world of the first film, however I think that's fair. Obviously it's a kid's film, you can figure it out anyway. The film had less content on Riley's actual life (it was probably slower moving in real world time) and more on her emotional makeup. As a result, new idea emerged for thoughts which I thought were very interesting. Undoubtedly, things become more complex and character and values emerge more during your adolescence, you find yourself become more self aware, and you find your negative emotions more overpowering. I think adults can definitely remember that, and as a teenager I definitely can. The emotional imbalances, just from the mental side of being a teenager are strong and you find yourself making bad decisions. The film doesn't sugarcoat that. So the plot is very good. Characters are very well thought-out, but it's the concept of anxiety which makes me most impressed in this department. I felt the film was engaging, and the animation and voice acting supported this. I was nervous about the voice acting because previous voices for Fear and Disgust had left the project because Disney lowballed the wages but that's not actually hindered the film too much. It was still fine.Obviously, while the film was very good, I did feel like another 20 minutes or so would've been beneficial to the runtime. I know it's a kid's film and kids don't necessarily pay attention for that long, but building a world is important, and I felt like this film could've spent more time establishing what was going off. Everything happened so fast, and I get that that's the point of puberty, but it risked not fleshing out things more. That's just a small criticism, it's completely personal, but I get and respect the choice of Pixar not to.Overall, this was a very good film! I would recommend watching it. I've given it a 7 but please note that I'm not saying 7 as an ""average"" but 7 as in ""pretty good/more than above average"". I think it felt a bit chaotic but it worked, as that's very accurate to puberty.",7.0,Tasteless_Critic_Takes,2024-07-13,1.0,0.0
1022789,No summary,"After years of nothingness coming from Disney Pixar, people declared the studio for dead, and dead it was. Inside Out 2 might be the resurrection and the start for a new era of glory.This film is only 96 minutes long, of these there are 10+ minutes intro and credits. But it never feels rushed. Other movies need double the time to achieve less or the same outcome. This is just awesome.As someone who did watch the original I was pulled right into it from the first second on and they kept me into it till the end. If I am honest, there is no real flaw of this film. It tells an emotional coming of age story, that shows children what they will experience in a few years. Teenagers will be able to relate to everything this movie offers. And adults will look back at these times with a smiling and a crying eye. Like every good Pixar movie, there's something for everyone!I don't want to spoil anything for you, but I can say the new emotions fit perfectly into the already established ones and the story Pixar tells is fresh and reflective.I know this will be a hot take, but for me it is very close to the original and maybe even better, because puberty is not that long ago.The ending made me shed some tears, by the way.Anyways, that's all I've got. If you were struggeling whether to go and see it or not, let me help you in just saying this is the best movie of the year so far.

But that is unachivable because we already have a basic knowledge of the world building and characters, but this movie still delivered new world mechanics and new characters. Just as the human brain develops and new emotions appear the movie keeps this simbolism together. Both movies is about life crisises when a big enviromental change effects our emotions we ourselfs don't know what to do with this emotion. While the first movie was about how we shouldn't disscard any emotions because they all important to live our life the fullest, the second movie overall lesson is that we also can't let our emotions carry us away, feeling like stucking between a rock and a hard place.

1022789,No summary,This is a disappointing outing in what could have been a very good series of movies. There is no imagination show and in Inside Out 2. This movie feels as though it was produced by committee intending to make as bigger profit as possible without having to exert themselves in any meaningful way. It is as though it is a paint by numbers filmThis was such a disappointment to me as I really enjoyed the first film. That had imagination and showed that the creative team both enjoyed the process of making the movie and respected the intelligence of their anticipated audience.There is nothing new in this sequel. It contributes nothing to the world building shown in the first movie. Although some of the voice actors do make an effort to entertain the audience there is no sign but the writers produces more directors had any real idea of how they might carry the original idea of the first movie into a second movie.Both my wife and I left the cinema feeling that we had wasted a couple of hours of our lives. I would not recommend this film even to children and parents and other adults should steer well clear of it. I recommend instead re-watching the first film. I cannot understand how this feeble movie has attracted the high rating it has and drawn the record number of sales.

1022789,No summary,"*Inside Out 2* explores the emotional journey of growing up, depicting the challenges we face within our own minds. The film brings back familiar emotions from the first movie-Joy, Anger, Sadness, Fear, and Disgust-and introduces new ones: Embarrassment, Ennui (Boredom), Envy, and Anxiety.As Riley prepares to enter high school, the story centers on her efforts to officially join the FogHorn Hockey team. Throughout her journey, she faces numerous challenges: her hopes of joining the team are tested, her friendships are strained, her emotions become tumultuous, and the pressure mounts. Eventually, however, things begin to fall into place.Though *Inside Out 2* is an animated film primarily aimed at children, it resonates deeply with adults as well. It seems partly made for those experiencing difficult mental situations, serving as a poignant reminder of the difficulties of growing older, the impact of overthinking, and the long-term consequences of our decisions. The film also emphasizes that problems, fears, worries, and anxieties are inevitable but transient. It encourages viewers to take deep breaths, stay calm, and avoid overstressing.Live in the moment and don't overly stress about the present. While the future awaits, we exist in the here and now. Enjoy life, remember you are not alone in facing challenges, and keep friends and family close.

1022789,No summary,"Since 2015, Inside Out has been consider by many as one of Pixar's greatest movies, and one of the best animations ever released over all. With the newest Inside out 2 having been released, people had very high hopes for it, and believed that it would top it in almost every way possible. But the question that begs is: Is inside out 2 really better than the first one? And in my opinion, it isn't. So, let's take a look at the movie itself.First of all, the animation in Inside out 2 nothing less than stunning. Every single detail, from the characters' hair to the lighting, feels so alive and well built, and although Pixar always delivers gorgeous animations, this one deserves to be mentioned as an outstanding one. Also related to this topic, the use of colors in this movie is fantastic, just like the first, and helps the movie portray its message very well.One of the negatives of the movie however, were its new emotions. Even though I really enjoyed the new emotions, and believe they added a lot of depth to Riley's personality by not having only 5 emotions that can sometimes not be enough to portray the feelings that us humans have, I believe that with the exception of Anxiety, the other emotions felt unnecessary to the plot, and unutilized for most of the plot. I find this especially true with Ennui and Envy, which make few contributions to the plot, and feel underutilized.Another thin I felt was underutilized was Riley's mind, since, unlike the first movie, Inside Out 2 doesn't explore much of it. The personality islands for example were only briefly mentioned in the movie, and I believe that they could have explored the changes that they underwent.Overall, Inside Out 2, just like the first one, is a must see, and is definitely one of the best animations we had in recent years. And although I personally preferred the first movie, Inside Out 2 is still as good as its prequel was, and still deserves all the attention it's getting.",9.0,joaoum,2024-07-11,2.0,2.0
1022789,No summary,"Inside Out 2 is an excellent sequel to Inside Out. It's very well-crafted, the emotion work very realistically.If we only look at the real world parts of the movie, it's easy to realize that these are struggles that many teens encounter. I imagine this is how the writers craft the story. They look at what kind of emotions a teenager has and after they thought out the real world story, they create the story of what goes inside Riley's head.My favourite characters were definitely Anger and Pouchy. Their duo was hilarious.I can't stand embarrassing scenes, of which there was a lot, so it was hard for me to watch sometimes. I felt some scenes were boring and it wasn't as emotional as the first film.Inside Out 2 is a perfect sequel, because it's emotional, funny and it continues Riley's journey in a very realistic, relatable way.",8.0,matepolcz,2024-07-11,1.0,1.0

Anxiety, shyness, and much more are our eternal companions, and those 5 friends from childhood always stay with us as a support.

1022789,No summary,"I was pleasantly surprised about the explosive box office success of this sequel, however the actual movie didn't elicit the same emotion, instead, that was closer to disappointment. I didn't like how cut and dry the plot was, it felt too clean and neat, which takes away from complexity of the conversation this movie is trying to have. The core emotions barely interact with the new emotions, some of the things Riley does make no sense plot wise, and there are some bits that drag out too long or jokes that seem to have little to no foundation and do not land.However I did love Ayo Edebiri as Envy and I am happy that this movie was such a huge success for her career. The animation of the emotions was phenomenal and visually stunning, it was a great length, and I like that its popularity will likely start more conversations about mental health and emotional regulation in youth.

They're a good summary of what I really enjoy about this franchise, there's so much going on within our minds, and we should create mediums to help us understand ourselves that bit better.I'd love to have Inside Out 3 see Riley off to college, much like we see Andy do so in Toy Story 3, for this concept to really reach its peak.",8.0,tristanvmiles,2024-07-09,1.0,1.0

Coming to reviews, 7.9 is a what you give to this type of movie? Pixar is an animation company who imagines and they are very creative in every way. You can't really expect a movie that is related to real life from Pixar. Voice actors did their part really well. Joy finally reveals her anger to the other four, it was serious and I agree with Joy. It's hard to not emit your anger, everyone can say yes to it.In conclusion, the movie can be relatable to real life, and Anxiety can come up and mess up the brain.

What are they? How does each emotion interact with the others? How do we deal with these emotions?

1022789,No summary,"I mostly liked this, but like every Pixar sequel that isn't Toy Story 2, it's got nothing on the original. There was always potential for a sequel to Inside Out, though - growing up gets more complicated, so jump forward some years and have Riley and her emotions go through more things. The big question was always going to be how far they'd go, when reaching the teenage years. I think this film did a good job early on at capturing a new level of awkwardness and uncertainty that comes with being a teenager, versus being a kid, but as it went along, it felt like they could've pushed some things further. That could've risked the film getting too dark, or being entirely confusing for viewers under the age of 12, but I would've respected Inside Out 2 if it had gone there. It's definitely not trying to be a teen movie... I think if they wanted to do an Inside Out 3, they would have to make things edgier and only suitable for people 13 and up. Otherwise, it just wouldn't feel real, or honest. And I think this one only just gets away with not pushing things. It toes the line... and I guess Riley really is only 13, so she's barely a teenager. It kind of works, but if they go for a similar tone for another movie (and there probably will be another one, with how much money this has made), it will just feel narratively repetitive, if not identical, to these first two.Anyway, I really liked this for the first two acts. The final act felt a little cowardly. Beyond a lack of edge, I don't think the consequences were as intense or as impactful as they could've been (the stakes really aren't raised, even with Riley being older; the first film felt bigger and more devastating). And I didn't find the emotional parts hit here. I was waiting for it to build to a big moment or pay off, and it kind of does... but it just didn't knock me over. It might also be related to the toeing the line, and playing it very safe.But safe's working for this film. Everyone seems to like it, and it is a very likable movie. It was fun, visually engaging, and paced extremely well (almost too fast). It's colorful and funny (Nostalgia was hilarious and stole the show), and there are moments that are genuinely awkward and real. The smaller parts feel honest and, in the moment, are visceral/cringe-inducing. I just wish it reached a point near the end that was bigger, more impactful, or more cathartic.",7.0,Jeremy_Urquhart,2024-07-07,3.0,2.0

1022789,No summary,"We already got to see the first part of Inside Out in 2015, so it really took 9 years for a sequel to come. This time the direction is in the hands of Kelsey Mann, who gets his first real directing job with Inside Out 2. He previously directed the unknown animated short film Party Central in 2013 and 8 episodes of the animated series Megas XRL, which ran between 2004 and 2005. The voice actors from the first part do not all return, there are a number of other voice actors such as Tony Hale who, for example, replaces Bill Hader for the voice of Fear and Liza Lapira who replaces Mindy Kaling for the voice of Disgust. It won't really stand out to the average viewer and for the younger audience it will be a beet. But the question is whether this second part of Inside Out could match the first part, because the first part was of course a fantastic movie.Riley is becoming a teenager and that of course brings new emotions. When she ends up at a hockey camp so she can show her talent, it's Anxiety, Embarrassment, Ennui and Envy that are added to the company. But soon Joy and Anxiety get involved and Joy is banned with the old company so that Anxiety can change Riley. This does take the teenage emotions well and we see how Riley rejects her heart friends in order to be able to play herself in the picture with the popular girls and especially her idol. Yet it all turns out to be a bit of a repetition of moves. The best scene from the film is when Joy and the rest of the exiled emotions end up in a safe where the rest of Riley's suppressed emotions and secrets are also.Because I'm not really into the animated films myself, I always find it difficult to review them. Inside Out 2 was fun, card or relevant and educational moments of a child's development, but yes, what else can be said about it. The animation itself is beautiful and colorful, but not of a special level. It's kind of the standard animation we're used to, with no crazy frils. The humor in the film is clearly aimed at a younger audience, but as adults it is also easy to watch and accept. It mainly makes it fun to watch with your offspring, maybe the English spoken version can appeal to the adult viewer a little more, but it is and remains a film for a young audience.Inside Out 2 has become a fun movie about the transition for a child to puberty. The new emotions are a funny addition, but the first part was a lot more fun. The animation itself is beautiful and very colorful, but of a standard level. Whatever it is, the film is and remains the most suitable for a youthful audience. The humor is really adapted to that and you notice that. Of course there will be plenty of adults who still love this, but I fall under the category of 'meh'. That may also have to do with the fact that these kinds of animated films are not my thing, but my children, especially the youngest, have been able to enjoy to the fullest.",7.0,michvanbeek,2024-07-06,0.0,0.0

Riley, as being older, feels more in control of herself and her story feels more individually compelling because of it, as she is given hard choices and trials given by the circumstances of a new school, puberty, and complicating friendships. The portrayal of the necessity of anxiety in one's life was handled so intracetly in such an honest manner that it added so much more maturity and emotionality, but the film never loses sight of its target audience, still remembering to entertain at all the right points. Joy continues from the end of the first film as more accepting of others around her, yet this time finds new challenges to overcome and it's able to be just as compelling. But it's Anxiety who manages to be the most interesting part of this movie, being a character who has nothing but the best intentions with great ideas, plans, and ambitions, yet is short-sighted to what the effects of her predicted outcomes could be. In short, she's a fantastically written antagonist and is voiced exceptionally by Maya Hawke. On that note, the rest of the voice cast are all entertaining in their respectively as well, from returnees like Amy Pholer to newbies like Ayo Edibiri. The soundtrack, much like the first film, beautifully compliments the rest of the movie as well, elevating the film's elements and themes to full effect. And the climax, as well as the ending, triggered tears from me and will probably trigger tears from you as well.However, not all the characters seem to click as perfectly as others. Returning characters like Anger, Disgust and Fear feel demoted in terms of relevance at times, and newcomers Ennui, Embarrassment, and Envy felt very much underutilised throughout. Regardless, all the characters are still entertaining in their own rights. Moreover, the recasts of Fear and Disgust are only really noticeable if you're looking to notice the change, and they didn't really bug me.Overall, it's a wonderfully crafted movie with a main antagonist who's able to be a perfectly necessary evil, backed up by perhaps a new team of emotions that were lacking in a sense, and is able to portray so many universally relatable moments in a fascinatingly cartoonish way.",9.0,kademan-40962,2024-07-06,1.0,3.0

1022789,No summary,"I had low expectations going into this. Not because its predecessor was bad. Quite the opposite really. I didn't think they could top the last film, Inside Out. Spoiler Alert: They did top it. In fact, they went beyond topping it. This is the kind of film that would make Walt Disney proud. It's family-friendly, yet still manages to explore adult topics. Kids shouldn't have to worry about whether they are good enough or if they'll be able to fit in, however we all fall victim to our new emotions as we grow and discover our personality and who we're becoming, and this film illustrates the internal struggle we all go through beautifully. I wish I had seen this film when I was entering high school, it probably would've opened my mind to a different way of thinking and I would've handled a lot of things differently. Though, we are the sum of our experiences, which is one of the messages of the film, and at 29, after experiencing this film I feel it spoke to a younger part of me- that needed to know everything is going to be okay. Kudos to all the creators involved. You should be very proud.",10.0,wavehamptoniii,2024-07-05,0.0,3.0

1022789,No summary,"This movie has managed to match the bar set by the first one. Some unusual dialogue in places, and jarring sequence of events in the earlier part of the movie, but there are lots of scenes that make you think about what you would do in the situations presented to you, scenes that make you think ""that's understandable"" and scenes that make you want to shake your arms towards the screen like ""NOOO RILEY THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA"" and ""TURN AROUND TURN AROUND!!!!!"" In emotional moments, the lines didn't always land for me, but they make for great observations about how our minds work and what growing older is like. The scene near the end, where everyone hugs the flower, made me tear up from how hard it hit. The movie-makers did an amazing job at capturing just how emotions feel.

The art is gorgeous. Solid soundtrack. The crossroads of female puberty and new emotional traits come together on the big screen!The length is great and with the finish leaves you thinking there will probably be a follow-up! I was very happy with the humour and great character development with an emphasis on individual character traits working together to fulfil Riley's goals!It was a really lovely family movie with the correct messages for children and new parents to learn from! Please watch this movie! Not only is it highly entertaining it is VERY educational!Wonderful stuff yet again from the best in the business; Pixar!

1022789,No summary,"Inside Out 2 is a movie I didn't really ask for, and while I understand the hype and enjoyed my time with the movie, it´s sad to me that we are in a state of Pixar where they focus more on sequels that make money instead of original ideas. I´ve heard rumours that they might continue Toy Story too and now we are getting into please stop territory with the giant Disney castle overshadowing the little Pixar lamp in the beginning credits.This was a bit of a negative start but I actually enjoyed Inside Out 2 and I see there was more to explore about ageing and that was also the next step for the movie no doubt. It creates a fun little adventure that is enjoyable from start to finish, but I missed the magic from the original here. This is just a good enjoyable movie, not much more than that.Riley is now a teenager and going to hockey camp to see if she can join a pretentious team. Her emotions are trying to guide her, but they are interrupted by a whole lot of new emotions that wants to steer Riley in a new direction.The movie just don´t feel as imaginative as the first. Being presented with Riley´s body and mind for the first time is magical and how they describe things and how they work and look is really well made in the first film. There isn´t as much focus on that here, it´s all familiar to us that watched the first movie and except for a few good puns that also creates new world building the world is more or less the same. I feel like the way this movie starts it wants to be a clean slate, the way it introduces the characters one more time, but new viewers will have a lot of questions as to how the worlds works and what this and that is, it´s not as much as a clean slate as I think the creators thought.The movie is also not as impactful to me as the first. While the first was magical and fun, it also had the hard hitting emotions, I know I cried to the first movie with the Riley breakdown, but that is not as prominent to me here. There is one hard hitting scene with Joy talking about how that there is less of her and that got to me a bit, but on no way the same level as the firsts movie. I normally don´t compare movies too much unless I find it necessary, but here it is to me, as I also need to talk about why this movie is even a thing to begin with other than money. And again, this is still a good and enjoyable movie, but I don´t see more merit in it than that.The new emotions are fun and well made. I like how they pilot Riley differently but the way they create a half villain of one of them is a bit too much for me and some of the emotions kind of don´t feel like what they should. Anxiety is a bit all over the place, same with Jealousy, they feel like catch all feelings all of a sudden instead of being their own. It´s also nice to see more screentime from emotions that got a bit of a backseat in the first movie. Sadness takes a bit of a backseat here but Anger, Disgust and Feat feel more prominent in Joy´s journey this time, even though they are still just background characters.The movies focus on the changing life we have and how everything can crumble when we are teenagers is great and a great message. It goes a bit too cliché with it sometimes, but the pressure to fit in and find a new way is something we all feel and having a feeling like Anxiety being the catalyst to that is a great idea. Overall the movie handles it´s material well and I think it´s rather impactful at times. Life gets more complicated no doubt and the movie handles that well, and shows we are more than our simple emotions and bevies. I liked the idea of the ending, but it´s more or less the same moral as the first, we can´t just be simple people.The animation is good, but somehow don´t feel on par with the first movie on some levels. There are some Janky animation sometimes, often with a lot of elements on screen like the river scene, and I still don´t know about the light and fur effect the movie has on the emotions, it looks weird to me.Not a bad word about Amy Poehler, she is amazing and does a great voice performance here, but I never connected her voice with Joy´s not even in the first movie. Maybe it´s the look of the character and the voice that I just can´t connect. The performances are great here though all around.The jokes and humour is good and it balances this with the fun interactions from the emotions like the first movie. That and some good puns also makes the humour work well.I really enjoyed the score here. Well-made and crafted by Andrea Dartzman. A lot of different genres and mods all done well.The after credit scene at the end is not worth it. I know we all wants to cherish the people that made the movie but trust me that small joke is not worth sitting through that much credits for in the cinema.Inside Out 2 is good and is a fun and enjoyable time. I don´t think I will ever see it as on par with the first and it needs that little more Pixar magic to really hit like it should. But this is still worth a watch no doubt and a lot of the elements are well done overall.",7.0,mickeythechamp,2024-07-04,1.0,3.0

1022789,No summary,"Inside Out 2 is truly a fantastic sequel, even surpassing the first film (which is relatively rare these days). It tackles various topics that make the viewer reflect and identify with Riley and her emotions. We can also mention how the film deals with the character's personality change, creating several problem-solving situations for the emotions (similar to the first film).However, the movie does have some negative points. It's slightly stereotyped because Riley goes through a few (not many) situations that would rarely happen to someone her age. Additionally, there's a lack of humor and comedic relief, as the film tailors jokes and funny situations for a younger audience (using slang and internet expressions), resulting in a lack of humor for older viewers.In summary, if you fit the movie's target audience, it's an excellent work; otherwise, it's average.",7.0,lasgartofoda,2024-07-03,1.0,1.0
1022789,No summary,"By Ian Chandler - July 3, 2024""Inside Out 2,"" Pixar's latest film, is one of 2024's most enjoyable films so far. A sequel to the 2015 original, the lovable emotions make their return as they try to adapt Riley to her teenage years. As with most teenagers, however, their situations become messy, awkward, and sometimes frustrating. Even worse, unstable emotions enter the scene and cause some nail-biting, but mostly humorous scenarios. But the question is, just how good is this film?The first and most obvious thing about the film is its animation quality. Just like the original ""Inside Out,"" this sequel is packed with beautiful, vivid colors and expressive animation. Every frame is bursting with personality, encouraging the viewer to observe every detail on the screen. Enhancing the gleeful presentation is the voice cast. Poehler, Smith, and Black return as Joy, Sadness, and Anger respectively. Their voice work is, as expected, exceptional. Hader and Kaling did not reprise their respective roles as Fear and Disgust. Thankfully, their replacements sounded so similar that it was difficult to notice they were gone. New to the cast are Maya Hawke, Paul Walter Hauser, June Squibb, and much more. Hawke is a standout for her performance as Anxiety, as she provides appropriately chaotic energy for the character. Squibb's brief role is admiring too, since the actress still proves to remain strong at 94 years old.The plot is easy to swallow for children and is still capable of engaging adult audiences; however, it is quite familiar to the first film. Because of this, the ending can easily be predicted within the first act. Even so, the film keeps the fun going with enormously entertaining sequences and humor that may have the whole family laughing. Slapstick gags and goofy jokes are aplenty, making it easy for most children to smile. For adult audiences, the film has relatable scenes that feature what Riley's parents are thinking. Additionally, there are some references to pop culture that may have kids wondering why their parents chuckled. What is not so joyful, but necessary for the plot, is how many times one will wince at the awkwardness of teenagers. It may trigger all of the audience's anxiety emotions to take control.""Inside Out 2's"" pace will successfully keep the focus of those with the lowest attention spans; however, for everyone else, it may be a bit jarring. Though it is a bit speedy, it is not nearly as bothersome as the pacing in 2023's ""The Super Mario Bros. Movie."" Pixar's film knows to not overstay its welcome, but perhaps an additional 10 minutes would permit the film to take a few more breaths now and then. Some scenes are fleshed out and take the proper amount of time to flow; others blaze faster than Bing Bong's rocket wagon. The short runtime isn't without its benefits. It does allow the film to have more showtimes in the theater; so, a movie night hardly imposes a challenge.The sequel to ""Inside Out"" is overall one of the best offerings of 2024. The animation quality is superb, the humor amuses people of all ages, and the characters are as lovable as they were nine years ago. It may pull some heartstrings, cause many to laugh, and encourage the audience to leave the cinema with a grin. And though the plot is largely recycled from its predecessor, it proves that certain plot elements can still be effectively used. Pixar's creativity and charm make this motion picture a family night highlight.Inside Out 2 - 83/100
Pixar's newest movie is a winner for the summer season. It boasts immeasurable amounts of charm and wit; however, the plot will make some have the feel of déjà vu.",8.0,ian-47918,2024-07-03,1.0,2.0

Anxiety's twitches were beautifully rendered on-screen too.Side note: the acting during Riley's panic attack is Oscar worthy. The girl has some serious acting chops! ...oh wait, she's just a CGI character. Can we add a new Academy award for these?

1022789,No summary,"I quite liked the first INSIDE OUT. It was a refreshing, well thought out concept and Pixar's most ambitious and most subtly intelligent film yet. The sequel is worthy follow up. The conceptual level this film operates on is still a pleasure to watch on screen. We hit the puberty/growing up stage with Riley and watching it all unfold, you know that at one point we all felt that way around that age in some fashion, so it kinda hits home.The new emotions are a nice addition to the film, the highlight being of course Anxiety. What they do with Anxiety voiced by Maya Hawke is quite clever because she's the reason why a clichéd plot feels fresh. You can't get more clichéd than a teen girl going to a new school (playing hockey), wanting to get in with the new cool kids, which leads to a tension with her old friends. It just feels new here because you see it work inside her head with Anxiety leading the charge. I also liked how the other emotions that were picked also correspond to growing up/puberty such as Embarrassment, Ennui and Envy.The only thing that felt like sequelitis is the story beats - for example the first film had Joy and Sadness apart from the control center, making their way back and now here it's all the old crew making their way back. Fear, Anger and Disgust took over without Joy and Sadness in the first film. Here the new crew of emotions take over. It's not a huge deal, but there's some area of familiarity and kind of by the book.The new belief system called ""Sense of Self"" that looks like a tree, is also a nice conceptual touch as well. The tree houses memories and feelings that form Riley's beliefs, so if the first film was about understanding your emotions, this sequel touches on how your emotions can change your understanding of yourself.Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith anchor the film. Mindy Kaling and Bill Hader were replaced, but it doesn't really take away from the film. Tony Hale and Liza Lapira take over commendably, but honestly a lot of these big budget animated films can really cast professional voice actors in the roles instead of big names.I also wanted to point out that I'm just not the target audience for movies like this, and my biggest gripe about the first film was Bing Bong's ""death."" I got what the film was trying to say, but it's just the one part in the film that I felt tried too hard to tug my heart strings. Plus it didn't help that I didn't really care for the character, but I know I'm in the minority. So with that being said, I liked how the sequel didn't need another ""gut-punch"" moment or tried too hard to make me feel emotional. It was more subtle about it and I appreciated that a lot. That's just my acquired taste I suppose.Like the first film, there's a lot of visual appeal. Animation is gorgeous to look at. You can get lost at all the colors and detail. Kudos to the animators.Overall, for a film that's nine years late it delivers and doesn't miss the mark. It doesn't quite reach the heights of the original because well, this is a sequel. It's hard to outdo the first, hence why there's only a handful of sequels that are better than the original, but it does enough and gives enough.8/10.",8.0,drawlife,2024-07-02,2.0,2.0
1022789,No summary,"The animation is beautiful. The requisite emotion and heart string pulling is present (though not nearly as effective as it was the first go around) and the majority of the voice acting is still great. Overall, a lackluster film however. Mainly because the new emotions are either downright obnoxious (looking at you anxiety) or so forgettable and underdeveloped that you actually forget what they're supposed to represent (the little one that my girlfriend had to keep reminding me was envy literally had no purpose and shouldn't have been in the film - doesn't help that the actor voicing it - Ayo from the bear - is totally without charisma)As others have said - the new emotions are all basically facets of the ones that were already introduced in the first film. The re-cast of fear (Bill Hader in the first, Tony Hale in this one) was too bad - didn't like fear this go around but found him quite funny in the first. Sadness is still the best character without a doubt.They also missed huge opportunities to explore what puberty is like for a teenager. Felt like the entire focus was just on being good at hockey and fitting in with some cool older kids - hardly the storyline I would think best lends itself to what it's like to experience the body changes and new emotions that come along with puberty. It absolutely lacked the emotional punch of the original and when it ended I was surprised it was already over. Felt like not a whole lot happened.

1022789,No summary,"""Inside Out 2"" is a sequel definitely worthy of the original, which tackles adolescence and it's the second Pixar film (after ""Turning Red"") to do so. Now, Riley is 13 years old and in a very crucial point in her life: she's going in a three-day hockey camp with her best friends from elementary school the summer before junior high school. Her brain headquarters undergo massive changes (actually a demolition) and she's officially a teenager! New emotions appear and become conspicuous soon. This film has the same level of humour as the first one, new characters (including new emotions) are compelling and funny, musical score remains fit for every scene, the exploration of new places in brain, as well as the addition of more complex concepts (like the ones of ""Sense of Self"" and beliefs) transfuse a feeling of maturity and push this movie to the coming-of-age genre, a fact that doesn't detract from its charm and wit, although some of the themes examined in the film might go over younger children's heads. Still, it's a motion picture the whole family can enjoy (even though it will be appreciated more by tweens, teens and adults) and its characters remain as relatable as in the first one, and makes it to be one of the few Pixar sequels matching the quality of the original (which established itself as a modern classic).

1022789,No summary,"""Inside Out 2"" brings a breath of fresh air with the inclusion of new emotions, adding some interesting new elements to the film, though it never truly surprises or deeply moves the audience. The new emotions enrich the narrative and offer new perspectives on Riley's inner world, the protagonist of this animation.Pre-teens and teenagers will likely identify with many of Riley's experiences. The film captures the emotional complexities of this age group with some sensitivity and humor.However, ""Inside Out 2"" is less emotional than its predecessor. It lacks the ""soul"" that made the original so special and touching. At times, the narrative feels more like a conventional product, following the typical formulas that Disney and Pixar have repeated in recent years, without the emotional impact that marked the first film.Despite this, it is an animated and enjoyable film. While it doesn't reach the same level as the original, it remains an entertaining experience. The animation is vibrant, and the story, though predictable and reminiscent of the 2015 work, offers fun moments and some interesting scenes.",6.0,pedroquintaoo,2024-07-01,1.0,3.0
1022789,No summary,"Inside Out 2 is the sequel to the massively successful Inside Out, a Pixar film that came out in 2015, which next year will make it 10 years old. At first, I was a little nervous when they announced Inside Out 2 at D23 in 2022 it seemed to me at least that they just wanted to cash in on a beloved IP like Inside Out, and I'm glad to say that Inside Out 2 does not feel like a cash grab and feels like an earned sequel.Inside Out 2 follows 2 years after the first movie with Riley turning 13 and the struggles that come with being a teenager, like friendship, popularity, and most of all, new emotions. The new emotions are Anxiety, Envy Embarrassment, and Ennui or boredom and I think they're worthy additions to the cast with them giving enough screen time as the main emotions.I also think the voice acting is amazing in this, with Amy Poehler doing another fantastic job as Joy and Phyllis Smith as Sadness, but I must mention that Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling do not come back as Fear and Disgust.However, the character I like the most is one of the new emotions, that being Anxiety, voiced by Stranger Things member and Ethan Hawke's Daughter Maya Hawke with voicing the character like she drank seven Red Bulls which in the movie shows she does that. Now the movie does this clever thing of not making Anxiety a villain but more of an antagonist, with her motive just simply being she wants to help and make Riley better.Which I think is a great thing to do because Anxiety isn't this thing that goes away after a while, it's a thing that sticks with a person for all their life and maybe fades into the background as a person grows up, which I think is a good lesson to teach the older kids in the audience. So, making her this misguided person instead of an upright, evil emotion.The animation is also beautiful with the character looking so realistic in a cartoony way and the lighting and colors popping more which isn't shocking since animation technology and the medium as a whole have had a huge upgrade within the last 9 years with it looking as clean and life like it has ever been before.I also loved the places the main emotions go outside of headquarters, being creative and awe inspiring to look at and explore with the main 5 with creative ideas like a brainstorm being an actual storm of emotions or the stream of consciousness being whatever the person is thinking at the moment flowing through the river and other fun ideas throughout the film.It certainly expands the ideas of the first movie, with one of the main new concepts introduced being the belief system, with it being down at the bottom of Riley's mind with being a bunch of strings that are formed by combined emotions that make up who a person is as an individual. The new emotions try to ""ruin"" by putting negative beliefs.Also, Riley feels like a flesh and an important character instead of a blank slate for the plot to happen. Riley actually has desire and motivations and goes through an arc herself with her wanting to fit in with popular kids and join the cool hockey team, which is the Fire Hawks. There is also a scene at the climax where she has a panic attack, which I think the movie handled well and was a nice representation of what it is like to have one.Now this film isn't perfect, with one of my grips being that Joy goes through the same character arc as the first one, with her needing to learn that she can't be the singular emotion controlling the belief and emotion systems but instead that all the emotions even the negative ones need to control the console board when they are needed.Even though this is pretty much the same lesson of the first movie for Joy with her not letting Sadness control the console since she in her opinion thinks Riley shouldn't experience negative emotions like Anxiety or Sadness but learns the value of said emotions and finally lets those emotions control the console when Riley requires them. I also think it isn't as emotional as the first one, with some dialogue feeling like the movie is grabbing you by the face and yelling ""THIS IS THE MESSAGE OF THE MOVIE""! Or ""THIS PART IS SUPPOSED TO MAKE YOU CRY, CRY NOW PLEASE!!"" with some lines being ""Maybe when you grow up, you feel less joy..."" or ""You can't beat Anxiety"". But in the end, it didn't bother me that much watching it.So, in general, Inside Out 2 is a great sequel with it expanded on the original even if I don't think it ties with the original in terms of emotional weight but with stunning animation, a stellar voice cast, and an emotional lesson and core at the center and fleshing out the main human character not to mention making the villain not a villain I think Inside Out 2 is a worthy contender of good if not amazing animated Pixar sequels which are few and far between in terms of quality.",7.0,Quethinks,2024-06-30,0.0,1.0

The storyline is just another adventures of the protagonists, with most of them are just exactly like what' s happened in part one.Some of the little details like Lance Slashblade' s homage and Joy' s bleak line still makes me chill.Overall, the lack of contents hardly make ''Inside Out2'' to stand out as a sequel, but the inherited fluency doesn't reduce my love for the series.",7.0,andrew-51451,2024-06-30,1.0,1.0

Found myself reaching for popcorn when anxiety was in action. Felt all the embarrassment and need to be liked and approved of by others. My kids (5yro twin girls and 8yro boy) had tons of insights and learning from it. It does an amazing job of emphasizing why we need all our emotions for different purposes. That none are bad or wrong but we can't let them take over or push out the other emotions. We need to be sad sometimes, we need a little anxiety to make sure we do important things, fear keeps us safe, and boredom helps us relax.

1022789,No summary,"""Inside Out 2"" absolutely nailed it! This sequel dives right back into Riley's head, now with added teenage drama and a brand new emotion, Anxiety. Maya Hawke's Anxiety is like a caffeinated squirrel, frantically trying to control everything, and it's comedy gold. The scene where Riley has a panic attack during a hockey game was both hilarious and surprisingly intense, perfectly capturing the chaos of teenage life. Watching the old gang like Joy, Sadness, and Anger navigate this new mess is like watching your favorite sitcom on steroids.Visually, this movie is a goddamn feast. The colors, the creativity, the sheer insanity of Riley's mindscape-it's like Pixar decided to drop acid and take us along for the ride. The new emotions, like Envy and Ennui, might not steal the show, but they add enough spice to keep things fresh. And holy hell, the Blue's Clues-inspired nightmare? Pure genius. I laughed so hard I nearly choked on my popcorn. This film manages to balance side-splitting humor with deep, emotional moments, and it works like a charm.Sure, the plot is a bit predictable-Riley figuring out how to be herself amidst all the teenage bull-but who cares? The execution is flawless, and the emotional beats hit just right. Seeing Riley come to terms with her identity, shedding all the societal pressure, is incredibly satisfying. ""Inside Out 2"" is a beautifully chaotic, hilarious, and touching sequel that doesn't just revisit old themes but expands on them in a way that's both entertaining and meaningful. 4.5 stars, and a round of applause for Pixar's latest masterpiece!",9.0,natmavila,2024-06-29,5.0,5.0

1022789,No summary,"I never planned to see this in theatres. Because Pixar has a pretty bad record with sequels and I hated a lot of them. I saw the trailer and didn't think much of it. But I decided to watch it anyway. From the first 5 minutes, I got a huge sigh of relief because the character development from the first film is still there and it didn't recycle the first filmStory/Plot- 8.5/10For the first time since Toy Story 3, a Pixar sequel felt like a natural continuation of its predecessor. They expanded the universe, introduced new concepts and characters. It even portrays the first film's message stronger but that's where one major blemish comes in. Sometimes, it felt too much like the first film and the tone of the film wasn't that distinct from its predecessor. So because of that, I occasionally got that feeling of unoriginality. However, I would say it still has a really strong story and excellent themesAnimation-8.5/10The animation arguably looks better than the first. It has a ton of creative scenes and visually stunning shots. The style of the new emotions looks great and there's really no scene that felt like it was lacking in the animation department. It's just that most of the film happens in the exact same place as the first does so no new environments. Still though, the animation of this film is really really goodCharacters- 10/10Scoring a 10 on the characters section is extremely rare, but Inside Out 2 did it anyway which just shows how above and beyond this film is. The biggest issue of the 1st film is the lack of certain characters. Any emotion besides Joy and Sadness felt almost pointless. But they surprisingly fixed that issue here. Every single emotion had a big role in this film and no one was sidelined, all of them had a fitting with what emotion they representedWriting- 9/10It was exceptional, for the most part. The writing started out really strong but it got progressively weaker as the film went along. So the 2nd and 3rd acts are noticeably less entertaining than the first. But overall, this is easily the best-written Pixar film since CocoEnjoyability- 8/10Overall I would say I had a very fun time. It's hilarious, it's emotional, it is visually stunning and it has everything you could possibly want in a feature film. But my biggest problem comes from this section. As much as I enjoyed the 3rd act climax, it just continued on for a bit too long.Overall score: 8.4/10This is probably the most shocking film Pixar has ever made. I can't believe how well it works. It's miles better than most of its kind and the best Pixar film since Coco. This is legitimately the only non-toy story Pixar sequel where the quality comes pretty close to beating the original.",8.0,Maxyger756,2024-06-29,3.0,5.0
1022789,No summary,"As a parent who has often found recent Disney offerings veering into themes unsuitable for young audiences, ""Inside Out 2"" comes as a much-needed breath of fresh air. My skepticism was swiftly replaced with delight when I discovered that this sequel diverged from the recent trend and instead focused on the vital topics of mental health and anxiety, steering clear of more mature themes like gender and sexuality.Accompanied by my enthusiastic 9-year-old, we ventured to the theater, and I must say, Pixar has once again delivered a masterpiece. The film not only entertains but educates, seamlessly weaving complex emotions into a narrative that children can grasp while adults appreciate its depth.What truly sets ""Inside Out 2"" apart is its commitment to maintaining the innocence of childhood. In an era where many films aimed at youngsters push boundaries, this sequel manages to captivate without compromising on age-appropriate content. By spotlighting issues like mental well-being in a thoughtful and accessible manner, Pixar demonstrates a commendable dedication to creating films that resonate with both young viewers and their caregivers.As parents, it's crucial to support productions like ""Inside Out 2"" at the box office. By doing so, we send a clear message that there is a demand for films that prioritize children's emotional development while respecting their innocence. Let's ensure that Pixar continues to produce quality movies that inspire and uplift our youngest generation.""Inside Out 2"" is not just a sequel; it's a testament to the power of storytelling in nurturing young minds and fostering meaningful conversations about mental health.

1022789,No summary,"""Inside Out 2"" is an incredible sequel. It's inexplicable how Pixar is always able to be one step ahead of the whole cinema, being able to explain in simple animated films things that cannot be explained in words. However, I think it is much lower than the first, both for originality and for characters, both for story telling and for comedy and entertainment. The only flaw of this film in fact is unfortunately have many things similar to the first film, but you could not get an original idea since the mind of Riley is that and there are not many plots of adventure to be included. In my opinion Inside Out was a unique film, but this idea of continuing the story by bringing to the Riley teenager there is a lot, and they did it excellently. The classic emotions are reconfirmed of the incredible characters and Anger in my opinion is distinguished from all, can take more space and make the viewer laugh. I liked the new emotions, but never as much as the introduction of the originals. Anxiety is a great emotion and Ennui, Embarrassment and Envy are interesting emotions that I hope will have more space in the third film as already done in this sequel with Anger, Fear and Disgust. The evolution of Riley and his friendships and beliefs I loved, especially for the way they are told. The first part of the film had left me a little disappointed, but the second part excels. The end of the film is perfectly made, perfect music, perfect photography, excellent movements and that explain tranquility, freedom. This movie also made me cry, even more than the first one. This is because seeing him as a teenager I found myself very much in Riley and I was moved by the way they managed to do it. I've seen this movie twice and I'm proud of it. I can not wait for it to come out digitally to watch it again, and again, and still...I look forward to the third movie with Anxiety :)

Animation was pretty good, but to wasn't really funny, except for a few parts, like when anger grabbed the pouch guy. Other than that it was kind of boring and the story seemed drawn out. The characters were pretty bland and predictable. The anxiety character was uncomfortable and annoying. To an adult very irritating. I knew what was going to happen as soon as the new emotions took over and was kind of waiting for them to hurry up and save the day so we could leave. I just don't feel the Disney magic anymore that made you leave the theater feeling good and positive. Or even invested in the character. The only ones I really thought were good were joy and anger, the rest were annoying. I know the movie is about feelings, I knew that going into it but it seemed to overdue the emotional aspect of everything. I say this because you need a good reason for strong emotions and most young girls are not this shallow and self absorbed. I think it's missing a really good story to drive these emotions. If they wrote and more entertaining backdrop for the emotions than her trying to impress high schoolers and make the hockey team it would have been a lot better. Even though I am thankful Disney mostly left the politics out. I still think it's just boring and uninspired. For me and my family anyway. I have two boys, but my wife also asked me during the movie ""is this boring to you?"". Disney and Pixar are just out of original ideas, which was evident in the previews for the Lion King, again, and Mona, again.

1022789,No summary,"The Inside Out franchise is one that continues to vex me. On one hand, they are decently entertaining romps, to be sure. But on the other hand, I feel as if they don't quite (or even closely, sometimes) measure up to the Disney-Pixar magic of old.For a very basic overview, Inside Out 2 picks up on the story of Riley (Kensington Tallman), now just entering puberty. As a result, Joy (Amy Poehler) and the emotions from the first installment begin being pushed aside by newcomers like Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui (Adele Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser). This leads Riley to lose her Sense of Self, which the original emotional gang set out to retrieve from the depths of Riley's mind.From a bare-bones story perspective, IO2 is pretty well put-together. It successfully links Riley's impending adolescence with new thoughts and feelings in a manner that feels authentic to real-world experiences. There are also some fun visuals and sight gags regarding the Emotions as they quest towards their goal--a ""brain storm"", a ""stream of consciousness"", and a ""back of mind"" waste dump. All of this is fairly entertaining in and of itself.Yet, there are a few key ways in such this movie didn't grab me the way it potentially could/should have:1. This franchise is now into ""retread concept"" territory in the sense that the use of animated characters representing emotions is no longer as novel of a concept as it was in 2015. Nothing to be done about this, obviously, but it makes this sequel seem less fresh.2. There isn't enough Riley, oddly. IO2 really slants the needle towards the Emotions, to the point where I feel like the connection between what they are doing and how it is manifesting in Riley is sometimes tenuous.3. When the (literal) giant red ""Puberty"" button flashes at the beginning of a movie, there are many directions it could go. I'm not saying that Pixar should (or would) do anything explicit, but having that concept turn into little more than a crisis of self-confidence for Riley feels like a big missed opportunity. Even in a non-sexual way, I feel as if many jokes or sight gags were lost in pursuit of this more serious plot line.A telling moment, for me, towards the end of the film was an incredible monologue from Poehler's Joy. While spot-on and capable of giving you pause in your theater seat, it (sadly) is not altogether earned to that point in the movie. One could almost argue the entire experience needed to be built around this concept, rather than having it dropped seemingly out of nowhere.Ironically, I also gave the original Inside Out a 6/10 score--if for completely different reasons. While I felt that film tilted too far in the ""we need to have parents bawling"" direction, this follow-up largely lacked the ability to even potentially persuade such high emotion. A really great balance of plot, emotion, humor, and gravitas has not yet been reached by either film.",6.0,zkonedog,2024-06-28,1.0,3.0

The 97 minutes chalked out for the story were just right, with many humourous as well as thoughtful twists and turns.The movie aims to establish a benevolent perspective on all emotions, memories and moments of life with a special focus on the interplay between anxiety and joy in creating a sense of self.Despite a focus on anxiety, the movie successfully paints a touch of humour throughout. The 2D animated characters were a delightful surprise and made it one of the most memorable scenes especially for millennials!An absolutely satisfactory step-up from the first movie!",8.0,arshiyasibia,2024-06-28,1.0,1.0

1022789,No summary,"Full disclosure: I am not an objective viewer of Pixar films. Born in the late 90's, it is not hyperbole to state that movies like The Incredibles, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo helped shape my childhood and the person I would strive to become.Thus, I stubbornly believe in the ""Magic of Pixar,"" despite a few recent lackluster outings.Coming into this film, I had high expectations. 2015's ""Inside Out"" was revolutionary, not just in terms of visuals (which Pixar has always thrived in), but in scale, presentation, and character work, as well. Bing Bong (Richard Kind), Joy (Amy Poehler), Fear (Bill Hader), and Anger (Lewis Black) all became - seemingly instantaneously - all-time great animated characters due to their depth, relatability, and hilarity.Inside Out 2, while unquestionably debuting some truly remarkable characters - Maya Hawke's ""Anxiety,"" Adele. Exarchopoulos's ""Ennui,"" and Paul Walter Houser's near-silent ""Embarrassment"" stole the show - thrived in a much different way than the original. While the original relied on the viewer to become attached to the internal variables of our protagonist, Riley - namely Bing Bong, Joy, and Sadness - the sequel (smartly) instead gives us more time outside of Riley's brain.The result makes us, the viewers, more attuned to the external factors forcing the ""emotional characters"" (Joy, Anxiety, etc.) to react the way they are reacting. It is more relatable, it is more uncomfortable, and it is more human.The inverse of that, unfortunately, is that the sense of childish wonder in the first film is replaced by a more hardened reality of facing things such as puberty, changing friends, annoying parents, and going to parties. I would assume it would make the film slightly less enjoyable for the younger demographic, but unquestionably more powerful for the older, like myself.One critique? The film doesn't give us another Bing Bong - and how could it, he is widely considered one of the best-animated characters of the 21st century - but it doesn't have to: Riley is the center of this movie, despite being guided by her internal emotions, and the weight of what she faces in these ninety minutes is enough to keep us, and her conflicting emotions, very much invested.",9.0,bagainsboro16-982-565177,2024-06-27,0.0,2.0

A bunch of new emotions rises up AND tries to usurp Riley's Joy resulting to her losing herself until old emotions do something to provide comfort to her rapidly changing environment.Yeah I guess the best way to summarize my criticism of the first and second Inside Out is how Psychologist criticize the fundamental basis of the Film: Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions -"" It is also often felt that the model is too simplistic and that there are greater emotional nuances not captured within it."".Call me old school but this film is just so on the nose that it really does lose a lot of what makes great filmmaking in my eyes. Humanity. This at its core is a good story for what it truly is about BUT formally, this is flawed AND overbaked.Compartmentalizing humanity of a person into equally humanized units just makes an absurd film. It trivialize so much of human interaction AND batters a direct reference to emotional signifiers of actions THAT is every metric about this films is so streamlined for a certain reaction. They cannot just infuse any kind of subtlety when the film is specifically made to have none at all. I could see why Psychologist loves this AND loves to use this film to help children. It literally spells it out to them.Had this say, about Riley and her friends (which is definitely what the film abstracted into Riley's emotions) - this would have been defiantly more of an nuanced emotional rollercoaster that Pixar has been sorely missing past their Golden Age.Sadly, its not.

1022789,No summary,"After 9 years and many films under their belt, Pixar and Disney have finally released the sequel to the fantastic Inside Out and today, I found the time to watch Inside Out 2 and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Riley tuning into a teenager, this introduces new emotions to Riley's mind which causes a conflict between the older emotions and these new ones.Main Character
Amy Poehler reprises her role as Joy and she is really good in the role. She has her own story arc throughout the film and though I don't think it was quite as good as it was in the first film, by the end of the film I did appreciate it and think it was well done. I preferred her interactions with the other older emotions and think Joy was a better overall character here.Supporting Characters
Maya Hawke plays the main new emotion Anxiety. She is kind of an antagonist of the film and though it is kind of by the numbers, I did enjoy the character and her development. She is trying to do her best for Riley but struggles with how exactly to do that.Phyllis Smith reprises her role as Sadness and she is nowhere near as important in this film as she was the first but that is okay and I think it actually better for this film as Sadness worked in her slightly smaller role. But once again the MVP of the film is Anger played by Lewis Black and he was so much fun and his fits of anger are hilarious, they even give him a bit more depth and it worked for me.I was very surprised that both Fear and Disgust were recast for this film. Bill Hader & Mindy Kaling are gone and this time we get Tony Hale and Liza Lapira in their places and they just aren't as good. They are kind of given bigger roles here but they do very little with it and I think it would have been better had we had the original actors.I also didn't really care for the new emotions (except for Anxiety). We get Envy, Embarrassment & Ennui. They just don't offer that much and are completely overshined by Anxiety who owns every scene that involves this group which is a shame given the potential that all these new emotions have.Story
The story is good, it focuses way more on Riley and events that take place in her life and how hitting puberty and the lead up to high school really affects her. By the end of the film, I did like the story and the emotions story does have some real heart and care to it. But, a criticism I give this film is the fact that there is some re-treading from the previous films story just involving different emotions and though it was done well it did affect the overall quality of the story.Script
I am happy to report that the clever writing from the first film is back here and this is one of the major reasons that this film is accessible to adults. The comedy is still well written and there were laughs here and when the emotion is put into it, this film really nails it and does it really well.Style
The style of the film is very similar to the previous one and there is no problem with that. It is colourful and has great visuals for sure. The film is also 90 mins, just like the first film and it flows by really well and is a really easy watch.Overall
Overall, Inside Out 2 is a great sequel. I didn't quite enjoy it as much as the first film but this is a really great film and a worthy sequel that is once again a great family film.Rating - 8/10.",8.0,alindsayal,2024-06-26,1.0,2.0

1022789,No summary,"While the first ""Inside Out"" was incredibly creative and inventive in creating a young girl's psychological state in a way that was approachable to young children and visually beautiful in a CGI animated format, I wasn't sure if the sequel would manage to be quite as unique. While there is admittedly less of a novelty factor this time around, and it's not quite on the level of Pixar's best sequels (which are Toy Story 2 and 3,) I'm happy to say that this is a very worthy sequel that has new emotional depth and compelling characterization to complement the stunning animation on display.In ""Inside Out 2,"" Riley has now turned 13 and is attending a hockey camp with friends. While the primary emotions in her head (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust) think they have things mostly under control, eventually some new emotions (Anxiety, Ennui, Nostalgia, and Embarrassment) show up. Anxiety wants to be the primary decision-maker when it comes to managing Riley's emotions, setting the stage for conflict. While the street-level (meaning not inside the mind) storyline and stakes of the challenges Riley comes across at hockey camp aren't quite as compelling as the storyline from the first movie that more centered around growing up, the film makes up for that due to the Anxiety character. The film's depictions of dealing with anxiety are uniquely profound and thoughtful in ways that even younger kids will be able to understand, and they play a significant role in the narrative. The conflict between Joy and Anxiety was also done very well, as Anxiety feels that she is simply doing what she needs to for Riley. And of course, the animation on display is visually stunning, representing clever concepts inside the mind in aesthetically unique ways. With a humorous but sometimes tear-jerking screenplay, a nuanced and insightful understanding of anxiety, and great entertainment value for families and adults alike, this sequel is gladly recommended. 8/10.",8.0,bastille-852-731547,2024-06-26,12.0,9.0
1022789,No summary,"I have DID and have different selves in my mind very similar to the emotions that live in Riley's head. I love how all the characters/emotions all want to help and protect Riley, and have their own ideas about how to do that. The addition of extra feelings such as shyness, envy, ennui, and anxiety added so much to an alresdy wonderful story from Inside Out pt 1. I think the movie makers took as simple concept of having feelings and the addition of new feelings at puberty to a masterpiece level. This kovie captured exactly what happens in our heads at puberty and how everything becomes chaotic. Ultimately, just like with DID, everyone inside needs to learn to work together, so did the emotions inside Riley. The artwork in the movie was spectacular as well.

1022789,No summary,"When I first saw the trailers for Inside Out 2, I rolled my eyes because it looked almost completely uninteresting. But then when the film came out in theaters, a very good friend of mine said she saw it opening day and was brought to tears by the end. So I went to see the film and after crying many tears and with thorough thoughts, I can say this movie is definitely a new favorite!!As someone who is somewhat of a harsh critic and didn't enjoy the first movie much, I absolutely loved this film. I loved the characterization of each diverse emotion, how they portrayed anxiety as a character and what it REALLY MEANS to have anxiety. The first film featured mostly Joy and Sadness, while this film featured each character equally and gave everyone funny and entertaining lines and parts. The film was sprinkled with emotionally charged moments that made me think ""Whoa.. I understand that situation/feeling"". As someone who also experienced heavy anxiety when I started puberty, I felt for Riley. The ending was a truly amazing way to put a stop to the film and I'd have to say the ending was my favorite part, not because it was over but because of the great acting and animation.Overall, go see Inside Out 2!! I'm definitely going to see it again in theaters (which is something I rarely ever do) and I recommend the film to families but also teens between 13-16!!

1022789,No summary,"This is not a bad movie but it's more of the same thing.The story works but it's the same one as the first movie. Joy is overbearing and controlling, forced through physical representations of abstract concepts, and ultimately learning to cooperate with other emotions.Besides Anxiety, the new emotions don't have much memorable about them. It is odd how their first major action of the movie is to do something completely villainous when they're supposed to be equals. Of the returning emotions, Anger is the only one besides Joy to have memorable moments. And that's mostly due to Lewis Black's terrific performance. Too often is seems like they had separate ideas but didn't know how to connect them all.Riley's story is the real heart of the movie. Her journey of growing up, losing some friends, and making new friends is more universal than the first film. The emotional beats seem more relatable this time. The scene where she wakes up the morning after puberty hits is a lot of fun, with the emotion board being ultra-sensitive. Too bad they didn't keep that going. Her story, at least, is a good continuation from the first film.One thing missing is the insight into other people's minds. A big part of the first film was seeing how the experienced emotions of the parents dealt with the situations. Too bad they're reduced to one-off jokes and lame explanations for why Riley's new emotions weren't in their heads in the first film.There is a lot of fun with the vault characters of the cartoon and video game hero. The animators had fun with their individual styles, at least taking something from the Spider-Verse films. The build-up for Riley's ""big secret"" is ultimately wasted. It seems like Pixar had one thing planned but Disney got scared at the last moment and replaced it with something pointless.The film looks fine but, again, nothing special. The first was already impressive and this just looks like they're reusing the digital assets.Like a lot of the recent Disney and Pixar sequels, this one works fine but is forgettable and unnecessary.",7.0,ARTaylor,2024-06-25,2.0,4.0
1022789,No summary,"I have never disclosed my credentials online, but in this case, it is of relevance. I have a PhD in Developmental Psychology and taught college course on Adolescence. This film is an excellent portrayal of the emotional flux that girls experience in early adolescence. I would recommend it to any parent of a pre-teen girl with the caveat that the parent should see it with her then discuss it with the child afterwards with the idea of interpreting the underlying concepts and morals of the story.As with any fictional account of adolescence, this film does not serve as a universal example, but certainly touches on the key emotions that puberty tends to introduce. It cleverly manages to show how the more basic emotions can be overwhelmed by anxiety, shame, envy and listlessness in a way that surpasses ordinary metaphor. It is also a good primer for parents who might better anticipate the changes that puberty brings. A very good book to read along these lines is ""Reviving Ophelia"" by Mary Pipher.

1022789,No summary,"""Inside Out 2,"" the latest release from Pixar, offers a charming continuation of the beloved original film, but it falls short of the studio's most exceptional works. While the movie is enjoyable and maintains the heartwarming essence that made the first film a success, it doesn't quite reach the same emotional heights. It's a solid follow-up, worthy of a 7 out of 10 rating.The story picks up with Riley as a teenager, navigating the complexities of adolescence with her familiar emotions-Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust. The film explores new emotional landscapes, adding depth to Riley's inner world and introducing fresh, relatable challenges. It's a thoughtful progression from the original, reflecting the changes and growth that come with age.However, despite its charm, ""Inside Out 2"" lacks the groundbreaking impact of its predecessor. The narrative feels somewhat predictable, and while it successfully captures the nuances of growing up, it doesn't break new ground or offer the same level of innovative storytelling we've come to expect from Pixar.That said, the animation is stunning, and the voice performances are top-notch, bringing the characters to life with vigor and humor. The film's exploration of teenage emotions is well-executed and will resonate with both younger audiences and adults alike.Looking ahead, it's plausible that Pixar might continue the franchise, potentially delving into Riley's journey through later stages of life. While ""Inside Out 2"" is a delightful addition to Pixar's lineup, it might not stand out as a must-see compared to their other classics. Nevertheless, for fans of the first film and Pixar enthusiasts, it's certainly worth a watch.",7.0,schmittfalte,2024-06-24,0.0,1.0

Great message, lots of fun, kids loved it, wife and I cried, and allowed us to have some good family dialogue about emotions.I thought they'd over play anxiety but as a parent and husband of anxious females, it was spot on. Not to mention the way it ends with a successful process.And, no unnecessary nitche message. My 16 year daughter related to it just as much I did.

1022789,No summary,"This sequel features new emotions appearing as Riley hits puberty, Anxiety, Embarrassment, Envy, and Ennui (Boredom). I do wonder why Ennui wasn't just called ""Boredom"". Most people know this about the plot, but the main one is that the five original emotions are trying to get Riley's Sense of Self back to the control panel. The resolution is amazing and I dare not reveal what it is. Actually, Sadness hides at the control panel, so it really is only four of them. I guess this makes sense as Sadness was the only emotion to accompany Joy in the first film.We get to see everyone shine here. Some people have wondered why these new emotions weren't shown in the minds of the other characters in the first movie, or why Anxiety only appears briefly in the other people's heads here. I guess everyone else is just better about suppressing those emotions. Still, it does seem like a plot hole. Whatever, this movie is still awesome, although it probably isn't quite as good as the original, maybe because of this plot hole. I thought Anxiety was a guy, but is apparently a she.The funniest scene is when we see the other suppressed emotions. We finally get some 2D animation in a feature length Pixar film! Some people say this was a shallow ""Bluey"" parody, but it's obvious to me it's mostly just a ""Dora The Explorer"" parody. Maybe they could have made a joke so many other people made about the emotions having emotions themselves? Whatever, this film is a must see. ****",10.0,ericstevenson,2024-06-24,1.0,4.0
1022789,No summary,"The first part was very successful, with innovative materials and clever angles of entry. Various emotions were personified, and the concrete imagination was unique yet particularly appropriate and reasonable.Therefore, I have a question about the second part: how can the story be made up? Would it be possible for a dog tail to continue a mink? This question disappeared completely when I sat in the cinema and watched for about ten minutes.The entire worries and doubts were swept away, and the new story, in terms of rhythm, characters, plot, and logical direction, is surprising. It continues the bold imagination of the previous part and further expands, with laughter and tears. The whole story is both expected and unexpected. After reading it, not only children but also adults will benefit greatly from it.It has to be said that this sequel once again proves an excellent animated movie, and telling a good story is the key to success.

1022789,No summary,"Two things from the outset:1) Inside Out is an inherently great concept. Soyo great, that it essentially writes itself. There are so many aspects to human cognition and development that lend itself well to good storytelling. As Riley, our erstwhile human the story is kinda-sorta about, grows up, new opportunities arise as she grows from a child to a young teen to an older teen etc.2) This movie was a sequel WORTH making for the above reason. It's not a surprised it's doing gangbusters at the box office, because, similar to Toy Story franchise, Inside Out acts as an allegory - albeit, way more direct - about growing up. This sequel felt natural.And I guess a third:3) This movie is not as good as the original. An original concept film will almost always surpass a sequel to it, unless that sequel really changes up the formula. Inside Out 2 feels like a necessary, appropriate, and fun revisit to a world we were introduced to 9 years ago, but doesn't carry quite the freshness or emotional heft of the original.That's not to say this isn't a good movie. I think Inside Out 2 is funny, entertaining, and very sweet. It improves on the original in one key way: Riley is a much more developed and interesting character, and the ""conflict"" of the film - whether or not she should pursue a new life with new friends or maintain her old ones - has way higher stakes. I actually cared about the interior emotional conflict and then implications for Riley.I also really loved Maya Hawke as Anxiety. To me, this might be her best performance to date, as I've never seen her in a role where I felt someone else couldn't do it. But she matched the manic energy and self doubt that Anxiety should have and her vocal performance was just excellent. Anxiety was such a great antagonist, as (like the real thing), she's fundamentally well meaning and necessary, but almost too powerful for her own good.I liked the other emotions as well, but perhaps appropriately for the story, most were overshadowed by Anxiety. They just didn't leave the impact the original five had and maybe that's the consequence of a faster paced story.I also felt the adventure itself was less interesting than the original; it's sort of a retread of the first, but thankfully with ALL the emotions coming together. I don't know how else they could've done it, but I wish they took the opportunity to expand the story structure than just essentially retread the first one.That being said, this is a good movie. It's a nice return to form for Pixar and I'm happy for its success. I hope Disney learns the right lesson: sequels work when they have a REASON to exist and the audience doesn't feel like it's a cash grab.

1022789,No summary,I seldom write reviews but just wanted to say Disney/Pixar are back to doing what they used to do best. My wife and I have noticed a dip in the quality of Disney kids films of late (or maybe it's our Nostalgia Emotion poking its head in to the 'good old days' when our kids were little)? But Inside Out 2 shows with the right writing you can have an excellent film. Thoroughly enjoyed it and it hit me and all my family on an emotional level. In between the release of Part 1 & 2 our kids have all just come through what Riley's experiencing in this film so it probably hits home a little more. Not withstanding Pixar nail the parents' emotions / thoughts extremely well. This film is great for all ages.,9.0,jrclare,2024-06-23,3.0,5.0
1022789,No summary,"The movie was great; in my opinion, it was better than the first one. Good job, Pixar, for making such a brilliant sequel. First, I really admired the conflict; it was intriguing to the viewer; it reflected and illustrated the true sense of the difficulties as well as situations that a new teenager might have to deal with. The introduction of the new characters was essential, like it was a prerequisite to demonstrate what happens at the start of the teenage years. The production of this movie was magnificent, the plot was amazing, and the sequence of events was brilliant; they made me understand and appreciate the movie as it was going.

1022789,No summary,"Just as bright and colorful as the first installment, Inside Out 2 is very reminiscent of the original and expands upon the world that had already been established. The addition of Embarrassment, Ennui, Anxiety, and Envy is very funny and feels age appropriate for the time in Riley's life they are introduced.Keeping the concepts of the personality islands, core memories, and overall look of headquarters alive made both films very cohesive with one another. I really liked the introduction of core beliefs and how Riley's memories and experiences created the kind of person she was. Bringing all of these elements up as Riley is transitioning from middle school to high school was perfect timing because it goes along with her being confronted with making choices about the kind of person she wants to be, even in the face of external pressures.The one element of the film I was slightly disappointed by was just how similar the main plot of the second film was to the first. Perhaps it was watching the two of them so close together, but having both films center around Joy and Sadness being cast out from headquarters and spending the whole movie trying to make their way back felt very repetitive. While the journeys they took were somewhat different and this time they were joined by Disgust, Fear, and Anger, it kind of left me feeling like the two movies were more similar to two episodes of a procedural show rather than a film and its sequel.In terms of the plot going on in Riley's life, I did really enjoy seeing her having braces and little breakouts on her face because it took me right back to being that age. Her constant struggle between wanting to be cool but not coming by it naturally and wanting to have lots of friends but feeling like she doesn't fit in with her old or new peers was very endearing. I really appreciated that the film didn't place a ton of external pressure on Riley's character in terms of having dialogue explicitly state, ""you have to dye your hair red or you don't fit in with us"" because I really think you feel enough of that at thirteen without those words being said out loud so directly.I thought the second installment of the Inside Out universe was very well done overall and I would definitely be interested in future films if they decided to make more- I would just hope that the main plot between the emotions would vary a bit more. Any person who really enjoyed the first film would be a great candidate for seeing the second one but there's enough that feels very in the same vein that you could go and see Inside Out 2 without any prerequisites.",8.0,omallieharp,2024-06-23,4.0,3.0

1022789,No summary,"Inside Out 2 is a 'comfort food' sequel where the stuff of the first one is expanded upon and given more breathing room and making for nice world-building, but of course it goes without saying the film isn't as 'surprising' as its predecessor. However it's still very good.Inside Out 2 was probably an unusually safe bet for PIXAR: it was a sequel to their literally most 'cerebral' film and it looks like this one is gonna outperform the original film at the box office. So it's safe to say this series has become a 'lo-fi high-concept' franchise all about human thinking and emotions.I suppose the one big blemish of this film is that PIXAR has to potentially focus mostly on sequels now (as per Disney's relentless franchising): so what comes next? Bugs Life 2? Toy Story: The Infinity Saga Edition? Cars: Revved Up? Rata2ouille? Up Again? No thanks. Hopefully their next original outing, Elio, will be a success. But who knows?Inside Out 2 has just the right amount of depth to please kiddies and adults, and there's enough jokes to please both crowds also, and the story is still as honest as the first movie's. This meal has enough healthy and 'junk food' stuff to keep most of the audience happy and immersed.Inside Out 2 gets 8/10 IMDbs. 4/5 stars. It's a deserving sequel for a deserving movie.

1022789,No summary,"The Human ExperienceWith a runtime of 96 minutes and a weekend overflowing with emotions, ""Inside Out 2"" stands as a complete triumph in capturing the feelings people experience as they enter a crucial moment in life: puberty.It is admirable how the film successfully portrays the youthful quest for identity and belonging. Over the course of a weekend, the movie conveys, through Riley, a 13-year-old girl, the dilemma of not fitting in anywhere or trying to fit in everywhere without knowing what to do. In this transition, where not everything is happiness or sadness, new emotions emerge that contribute to personal growth. However, it is crucial not to lose the essence that defines us, as it is what allows us to be authentic. The film, with its accessible and entertaining approach, is not only directed at children but also offers a rewarding experience for adults, showcasing in an appealing and comprehensible way the complexity of emotions during adolescence.The film addresses interesting themes, such as the experience of an anxiety attack, subtly illustrating how these episodes can destabilize a person in a matter of seconds. Furthermore, throughout the plot, it is made clear that anxiety is not necessarily our enemy, and it is not an emotion that can disappear completely. Instead, it is presented as essential for human behavior, much like all those uncomfortable or unpleasant memories that we sometimes wish to forget. Nevertheless, we should not do so, as those memories shape us as individuals and contribute to who we are. There must be both bad and good moments, as they form our identity. There are no bad days: the best days become memories, and the not-so-good ones become valuable lessons.It is highly commendable that the film is suitable for both children and adults, as it exceptionally personifies the experience of anxiety. Although these themes might be difficult for a child to fully comprehend, the film represents these feelings through visually appealing characters endowed with distinctive emotional traits, such as anxiety, envy, and shyness. The dialogues of these characters are simple and accessible for the youngest viewers, presenting new emotions as antagonists, but no more than that, as the film demonstrates how the absence or excess of a specific emotion is harmful, integrating these new emotions into our daily feelings in a balanced way.With an open ending and a clear lesson: there are things that make us angry, others that bring us happiness, some that cause us sadness, and sometimes we feel envy or worry excessively about the future. All of this defines us as human beings; we cannot be completely good or entirely bad. We are a set of defects and virtues. Without further ado, I highly recommend visiting the nearest cinema to enjoy this film.""Anxiety is a manifestation of the perfection of human nature; it is the longing in earthly life for a higher life.""Soren Kierkegaard.",8.0,catooooo,2024-06-18,1.0,1.0
1022789,No summary,"The first film was something special for Disney. It did a great job with talking about how to properly deal with emotions in a way that is healthy and balanced. This film continued to expand on that by introducing the thing every teenager has to go through...PUBERTY. (duh, duh, duh...)The film once again centers around Riley who is 13 now. As she navigates through the early years of being a teenager, she continues to get some help from her returning emotions, Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust. But as soon as Puberty hits, we get introduced to new emotions, Envy, Boredom, Embarrassment, and Anxiety. We then see Anxiety slowly start taking control of Riley's life, and bottle up the old emotions away.

1022789,No summary,"""Inside Out 2"" brings us more emotions from Riley (voiced by Kensington Tallman), which you know means more issues. In the first installment it was Riley learning to deal with sadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith), now she has to deal with Anxiety (voiced by Maya Hawke). Anxiety cropped up, along with Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Embarrassment (voiced by Paul Walter Hauser), and Boredom (voiced by Adele Exarchopoulos), which was really indifference, once Riley hit puberty. She was a real mess inside.Having so many more emotions to deal with made the movie a lot more interesting. I'd argue that anxiety was the only real new addition. Kids have embarrassment, indifference, and even envy before puberty; anxiety, however, is something that a more developed brain and a person with more experiences would have.Anxiety had fully taken over Riley's emotions and kicked out her five original emotions. Actually, she had bottled them up--and I did like that pun.I liked IO2 more than the first ""Inside Out."" I'm on record as saying that the first ""Inside Out"" was too somber, down, and depressing.

1022789,No summary,"As a kid, I was diagnosed with severe anxiety. I feel like I dealt more with social anxiety than regular anxiety throughout my life but I could relate to Riley's panic attacks extremely.1 the way anxiety is shown in this movie is amazing . Usually anxiety is a mechanism to make someone feel like they're protecting themselves from something that might happen to them in the future, which is an accurate description for it. Anxiety can make you do a lot of awful things and as you grow older, you do start to pretend to be something you're not in order to feel loved. Although I do not like anxiety being treated as an emotion when it is rather a disorder in someone and is a bigger problem for many people who need to take pills and go to therapy for, still love how it was done in this movie. Though they treat anxiety sometimes like it's just a simple thing people experience, Riley doesn't use any methods in order to control her anxiety actually (disappointing) growing up I had to learn a lot of methods in order to control my anxiety before I grew up and didn't need to no longer. It's not realistic that Riley learned how to control her anxiety that quickly, especially without help. I don't even think Riley actually ever learned she had anxiety in this movie actually.2 Riley's relationship with her friends was very relatable. Everyone hides how they're mad at someone they love. I loved how her flaws and panic attack actually helped her admit that. I didn't really get why she became friends with those girls in the end, like they treated her like shet throughout the whole movie. What??? Did they just become these angels from heaven automatically in the end? What the hell is goin on? And they made her in into something she's not. How can Riley change and learn how to be confident in who she is if she's still hangs out with these wannabe thugs??? Wouldn't it make more sense if the main girl realized those weren't her real friends because of Riley and made a new team with her friends? The main part of growing up is moving on from people that made you into something you're not, that's how you get over it. Riley never even actually confronts to those girls that she actually wasn't being her real self and she just wanted to be good enough for them, that was really disappointing. I guess screw confronting your true feelings in front of them and moving on, let's just become friends with the a hole girls, yeah happy ending just for kids!3 I loved embarrassment and envy. Embarrassment was so cute and envy was adorable and funny. I laughed a lot whenever envy was on. I don't really get why enui is named enui, like everybody else has simple names like joy, anger and disgust why not just call her boredom? But her design was very well done for her emotion, she was a fun character to watch. I really wished they had some sort of attraction emotion or mechanic in this movie since that is such a big part of growing up into a teenager. They do slightly imply and mention that but it's not really ever represented. It wasn't represented in the last movie and this was the perfect age for Riley to show that part of her growing up.4 another thing is the movie only really talks about anxiety and nothing much else. It's mainly about anxiety basically. As a woman, I'm so happy to see this movie was directed by a female creator. Although this movie was created by a woman, The movie shys away from topics like ministration and the female body in general. Riley grows taller I guess but that's about it for her body. I'm not saying they should animate Riley with some huge kardashian tets or whatever but can she at least wear a small training bra or something? Most females do get their breast at 13. I like how they made Riley have acne but she only has one pimple and she doesn't even notice it. None of the other teenager in this movie have acne like at all. Almost every teenager I see in real life has acne. Acne is a serious part of insecurity as a teenager, where's the insecurity emotion?5 I loved how the main message of this movie is that there is always both bad and good things about us, but whether it's good or bad it's still apart of us and something that we should always accept. The main solution to anxiety is to simply accept the bad parts of you which is a perfect message for a movie about the real world and emotions. It's a beautiful message to teenagers that they are allowed to be imperfect and accept it because the older you get, the harder it is to face that you will never be perfect.Overall I just think that this film shys away from many things in order for parents not to sue their film. I think turning red represents puberty better in general since it didn't shy away from any more personal topics. Turning red represented sexual attraction, but not in a way where It was gross or inappropriate. This movie could've done the same thing as turning red such as attraction and ministration, it doesn't have to be a big thing in the film but it could at least actually exist in a good amount but rather those big parts of life (especially in a woman's life which Riley is a woman) are simply out of the picture in order to avoid conflict from guardians.But I just have to say, I could relate to Riley's video game crush asfff.

1022789,No summary,"Inside Out 2: Creatively RelatableEveryone experiences several types of emotions at different points in life. The Inside Out movies show how emotions can work together, to form someone's personality. Inside Out 2 is directed by Kelsey Mann and stars Amy Poehler, Maya Hawke from Little Women and Stranger Things, and Kensington Tallman. As well as, Liza Lapira, Tony Hale from Arrested Development, Lewis Black, and Phyllis Smith from The Office. New additions to the cast include Ayo Edebiri, Lilimar, Grace Lu, Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green, Adele Exarchopoulos, Paul Walter Hauser from Cobra Kai.It is the summer before Riley's first year of high school, and she wants to impress the high school hockey coach and team, at camp. Meanwhile, her mind is being introduced to some new emotions... Puberty! Just like the first Inside Out, the second one is creative, fast paced and has a good meaning behind it.Albert Lozano is a very inventive person for producing all these designs of each emotion. Between Lozano, Pete Docter (a visual animator at Pixar), and a couple of psychologists from Stanford, they were able to make these personalities extremely accurate. All the islands in Riley's mind are fun to explore, my favorite is where all the core memories are stored. It is essential because that is how someone forms their sense of self. All the Pixar animators did a fantastic job creating the colors and expressions. The energy of the characters captured the attention of young and adult family members alike.Additionally, all the voice actors played their parts well. Amy Poehler portrayed an upbeat and happy Joy. Maya Hawke played Anxiety, who fears the unknown. She was very hyper, like she had too much caffeine before coming to headquarters. She is one of my favorite characters since I can relate to having anxiety. Phyllis Smith voices Sadness, who believes she cannot do anything right. Her blue hair is a good representation of her mood, lots of times people refer to being sad as being blue. Lewis Black as Anger is hilarious. He looked like a red square, who would furrow his eyebrows every time he was angry. Disgust (Liza Lapira) along with Fear (Tony Hale,) helped get back to headquarters with Joy and Sadness, after they were kicked out by Anxiety. Ayo Edebiri voiced Envy, a green character, since she is jealous of everyone else. Adele Exarchopoulos, (Ennui), is French for boredom, which is why he lays there doing nothing. Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser) is shy and nervous about speaking and falls when he tries to shake Joys' hand. Something I found interesting was how even though they were Riley's emotions, they had emotions themselves. Joy gets sad when she runs out of ideas on how to get back to headquarters. Eventually, it is sadness who must be brave and go back by herself.Growing up, you get to experience different emotions, in one way or another. I never cared about fitting in, like Riley does. However, even to this day, I want to get good grades in school, but taking tests still gives me anxiety. Inside Out 2 is a fun movie that everyone in the family can enjoy. Everyone has their own experiences with all these emotions, which is what makes Inside Out 2 so relatable.",7.0,kimberlyely-27550,2024-06-22,0.0,1.0

1022789,No summary,"One of the tricks of making a succesful sequel is to capture the essence of what worked in the first film and then expand upon that to open up the world (or universe) that the first film is cemented in.With the new Pixar film, INSIDE OUT 2, the ability to expand and grow is made just that much simpler for the main character in this film is growing herself.Taking up a few years after the original INSIDE OUT film, this one follows our protagonist, Riley, as he she enters her teenage year and...gulp...high school! With these changes, Riley develops a new emotion (to go along with Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness)...Anxiety.It's an interesting concept to delve into and Writer/Director Kelsey Mann handles it with a deft hand, not diving too deep into the subject, but getting deep enough to give the film emotional resonance and a strong sense of purpose.Like the original film, the voice cast is stellar. Amy Poehler (Joy), Phyllis Smith (Sadness) and Lewis Black (Anger) all return and are aided by the additions of Ayo Edebiri (Envy) and, especially, Maya Hawke as Anxiety making this film the strongest Pixar outing since...the last INSIDE OUT film in 2015.A return to form for Pixar as this film delivers fun for kids and interesting, deep dives into themes that will satisfy the adults that accompany them.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10)...and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",8.0,bankofmarquis,2024-06-22,2.0,2.0

The film beautifully balances humor and heartfelt moments, making it an experience that deeply resonates.The new characters are a fantastic addition, each brought to life by amazing voice acting that adds to the film's authenticity.

The movie was good, but not as good as the first one. Of course, the voice acting was outstanding.

1022789,No summary,"The Simplicity of Inside Out 1 was Great but The Execution Of Some of The Complexities within Inside Out 2 Makes it Superior.Just Got of a Screening of Inside Out 2.⏪ Brief Recap - Inside Out 1 is about a Girl named Riley(the Audience), in this film, she's a Young Baby, through to about 11 years old. One of the Main parts of the story is that Riley is now losing those Childhood Memories as they fade away as she gets older and older, and those things she once loved when she was younger, either no longer matter to her or she has forgotten them. These particular spheres 🔮turn grey and dust away. Another main element of the film is that Sadness and Happiness are on opposite ends of a single line, you just can't have one without the other. (Outside of the film, the middle state in between the line of Sadness and Happiness, is Euthymic) Sadness>>>>>>>>Euthymic>>>>>>>Happiness⏩ So now we're at Inside Out 2 - and we have new emotions and a New Concept - Riley's sense of self(all different aspects & Characteristics of ourselves, put into a whole)📜 - We have the Back of the Mind(New) & Long-term Memories(In Inside Out 1)💣🏠 - We have the Demolition Squad coming into the Headquarters with Changes, Destruction & Expansion of Riley's new Age Span of 13 Onwards. Or Quite Simply put, ""Puberty"".🍊 - We have anxiety who is an excellent addition & easily the Most Useful of all of the emotions, though she does have a weakness of looking way too far into the future. Dial it back to the step by step concept, a simple and obvious concept but it's always great to hear these things reaffirmed on the big screen and it's one of her best thoughts.🍊 - She is in charge of Planning Riley's Future and
She looks at and examines every single scenario going forward. The Previous Emotions are now Bottled Up within Riley and Riley's Being is More Complex now, it needs More Sophisticated Emotions. (Anxiety🍊, Envy🍐, Ennui💜, Embarrassment💘, Nostalgia💨)🍊 - The ""I'm not Good Enough"" Result by Anxiety, this certainly could be taken as a bad thing, but it's really not, like Anxiety said ""it's that room for self improvement"" in any given human pursuit, that constant Strive for Perfection. But as we saw in the Film, this is of course a double edged sword, which caused Riley to think ""I'm not Good Enough"", in a Negative Way.🃏 - The Sar-Casm, which was another Great Execution and as kids hit those teenage years, they definitely start to use sarcasm a lot.🌞 - We Have Joy who is too much into having fun(obviously) and quite frankly can make people Delude themselves, Happiness has it's Place and is the overall Goal over all of the emotions but not to the point when we say everything is Sunshine. It causes Delusion.Overall, Inside Out 1 mainly deals with Forgetting Very Young Childhood Memories and is More Emotional(specifically Sadness) but Inside Out 2 Progresses and deals with Deeper Concepts, making this a Better Film In my Opinion.",10.0,DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed,2024-06-22,4.0,8.0

It brilliantly visualized and explained emotions in a way that resonated deeply with me. The cast, characters, and story were flawlessly executed, making it a cinematic gem that I've revisited over a hundred times.Sequels often struggle to live up to the original, but Inside Out 2 defies expectations with its sheer brilliance.

From start to finish, I was captivated and amazed by the depth of emotion and storytelling.One of the standout aspects of Inside Out 2 is the introduction of new emotions and the exploration of Riley's life timeline.

1022789,No summary,"It seems that you can always find the meaning of exploration, curiosity, friendship, encouragement, and most important, self-awareness in any character created by Pixar on their journey of growth. I promised myself that I would see each movie produced by Pixar 15 years ago when I saw a series of short cartoons they produced. When I first watched ""Inside Out"" in 2015, I learned about the function of sadness and the importance of mental health. In 2020, ""Soul"" taught me to live in the moment. ""Coco"" showed me how to keep my passion alive, and ""The Good Dinosaur"" taught me to face separation in life. This time, I learned to respect all my emotions and to maintain a multi-dimensional perspective while exploring the world.I guess we all have the intention to control our surroundings but the right approach is always improving our capacity and mindset to deal with various circumstances and consequences we face. That's why the final scene, in which Joy and Sadness finally recognize the importance of all emotions and memories-both good and bad-in shaping Riley's well-rounded personality, elevates the entire movie.

1022789,No summary,"It's the recovery era of Disney and I'm happy to say, the slump may be subsiding faster than we predicted. Because not only was this film fantastic, but it also reminded me why I cared so much about these films in the first place. During the last year and a half, I noticed the corporate side of Disney rearing its ugly head into almost every new release. Treating artists like dirt and supporting soulless concepts in order to make easy cash.But after watching the highly requested sequel to Inside Out, I'm starting to put faith into this company again. In this new adventure, Riley is starting high school and is starting to experience puberty. Gaining new emotions, insecurities, and new challenges after she learns she's going to be separated from her new friends after hockey camp. This leads to the new emotions debating with the returning characters about what's best for Riley, what mistakes she needs to avoid, and what concepts shall define her in the future.I call this a requested sequel, because it makes sense to make a sequel to a concept like this. What happens to the emotions when Riley grows up? What will her mind look like? There are ton of questions to answer with creative concepts to follow. I want to see this character grow up, so we can explore more of her growing mind. With other Pixar sequels like Finding Dory and Incredibles Two, I find myself enjoying them fine, but I never saw them as successors.Personally, I believe that if a sequel doesn't try to surpass the original material or tackle any interesting concepts, it doesn't need to exist. So I'm happy to say that not only was this film much funnier than the original but it also expanded upon its ideals. I'll be honest, Anxiety's character arc summed up about everything I was feeling on a regular basis. Constantly trying to avoid the worst case scenario while trying to avoid upsetting everyone around me. It would be so easy to make her a villain, but instead she's an incredibly relatable antagonist that's fueled by Muppet energy, leading to tons of great jokes.Inside Out Two is funny, clever, and it made me feel better about myself.

1022789,No summary,"A solid sequel to the first and continuing the complex story about emotions throughout a growing and changing persons life. Thankfully this one wasn't as emotionally heavy (RIP Bing Bong)! It was more fun as I think they took the criticism that the first one was heavy but that being said it still carries some weight and shows how complex and different you see and interact with the world with your new emotions growing up or through puberty. Anxiety is the main focus in this as it just takes over everything especially in early stages of puberty and it can be overwhelming and this is shown on screen in such a fantastic way. It further uses the idea from the first film too about how life isn't all about joy. Some really subtle ways of expressing things such as bottling up your emotions or gathering/getting your emotions in check. Some pretty funny jokes aswell along the way mostly to do with how the mom and dad react to the daughter hitting puberty, would've liked to seen more from that though as most the film was set away from parents. The anxiety being the main focus and how it can control everything over other emotions is something that rings true for a lot of people so it's easy to relate to the story being told making it more impactful.

1022789,No summary,"Back in 2015, Pixar's animated INSIDE OUT came out with an absolute bang. INSIDE OUT 2 has just released, being the biggest opening weekend for a Pixar movie ever. This is a fantastic sequel to an amazing movie. We are back Rylie, who is now a teenager. While the original focused on her family and making core memories to shape her into who she will become, the sequel is about her friends, fitting in at hockey camp, and her core beliefs. Being a teenager brings along all kinds of new emotions, as it does in this movie. As soon as the ""puberty alarm"" goes off, it's a chaotic whirlwind of emotions, some of you could probably relate. In addition to Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (now voiced by Tony Hale), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (now voiced by Liza Lapira), the new emotions are Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui (Adele Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser). This is probably one of the most relatable and human stories out there. From Riley's perspective, she's torn between trying to fit in with the cool kids and her two best childhood friends. Inside her head though, Anxiety suppresses the original emotions (literally bottles them up) and takes over. The writing is endlessly creative and on point for each character. The visuals are stunning (it's Pixar, when aren't they the best?). The emotion feels raw and true, although it didn't break me like the original did *cough* Bing Bong *cough*.

So I have left the cinema with mixed feelings about the movie, firstly, if I were to consider only the animation and the sound quality it would most certainly would be a 10/10. There for the content, the movie had big shoes to fill after the first movie, it is very difficult to dive into the realm of emotions and the human brain in general. Yes, it was not accurate, but we can all agree that the movie have delivers some sense of nostalgia and even some longing to puberty, combined with comedy, I believe this movie have secured its solid place in the 8/10 kingdom.

1022789,No summary,"I love Pixar with a passion and since their faultless run pre-2011 they have been a bit more of a mixed bag (no fault to them 15 straight years no misses is wild). But, with this in mind, I had multiple feelings present heading into this movie because I really wanted it to be great - Inside Out is one of my favourite movies they have produced; it's funny, creative, heartfelt, everything that makes Pixar beloved is baked into the original by Pete Docter. However, Pixar's history with sequels has been kind of a let down - it's hard to follow up films like Finding Nemo and The Incredibles with sequels that feel worthy to their predecessors.No spoilers, but here are some of the things I ""feel"" after watching:I think this might be their funniest script since Finding Nemo (2003), their best overall film since Coco (2017), and doubtlessly their strongest sequel sans Toy Story franchise. Amy Poehler is great as Joy; Anger, Fear, and Disgust get more to do in the story this time, there are some fresh ideas, animation styles, and environments explored; the story is tight and told well, and the film can be enjoyed if you have littles, kids, or students navigating puberty.It's a great conversation starter about some of the more complex emotions we feel as we get older and how we can navigate those without losing ourselves in the new challenges, doubts, and fears we have.On my overall Pixar list this movie sits JUST behind the original for me. Inside Out 2 was everything I had hoped it would be. If you love the original you will love this one too.",9.0,jmforsyth-33291,2024-06-20,0.0,4.0

I think I liked the second even more. You get to see the story much more with the main character and her parents. I thought that was great. It broke the story up more.

Just thinking back on a different life.I thought the movie was the perfect length.The one thing that threw me off for a bit was the part with the character from the kid's cartoon.

I am not sure how much little kids would enjoy it. My 5 year old nephew was getting a bit bored in the middle. He wasn't really getting what was going on and it had a hard time holding his attention.

1022789,No summary,"In 2015, Pixar released Inside Out and took us into the mind of Riley, a young girl who is dealing with her life being uprooted when her dad gets a new job, and she has to move from Minnesota to San Franscico. Together, we learned how each emotion is equally important in helping Riley deal with this sudden change. Nine years later, we rejoin Riley as she is entering her teenage years and is faced with a slew of brand-new emotions including anxiety, envy, embarrassment, and ennui. As they did in Inside Out, Pixar takes us into Riley's mind as we learn that all of our emotions, even the ones that we think are bad, are important.My expectations for this movie were very high and I am happy to say that they did not disappoint. My favorite part about this movie is the brilliant writing. Pixar has always been good at turning ""what if"" into reality, talking toys in Toy Story and talking cars in Cars. Inside Out and Inside Out 2 not only answer the question of ""what if there were a team in our head working to make our lives better?"", but they also teach us valuable lessons about our mind and our emotions. In a world where women are expected to always be smiling and men are not supposed to be in touch with their emotions, we learn that it is actually perfectly ok to feel sad sometimes (or a lot of the time) and see that feeling anxious about things is actually important.Inside Out 2 is now playing in theaters and I highly recommend going to see it. This is a great movie for all ages that will make you laugh and teach us all important lessons about being in touch with our emotions.",8.0,MovieswDan,2024-06-19,2.0,5.0
1022789,No summary,"The new film is as brilliant and wonderful as the old film was, using a very entertaining and imaginative way to represent emotions and their impact on people, more specifically, a young girl. The metaphors brought to life (e.g., stream of consciousness is stream, train of consciousness is a choo choo) and representations are very creative and very funny. The film gets a 10 for the wonderful images, sounds, and ideas. But it gets a 0 for accuracy. People's behavior is not controlled by emotions - emotions are only one factor that the person deals with. In addition, there is reality, internal processes, and social pressures. Each action takes place in the context of these competing forces. The true ""control panel"" is not in a room with the emotions, but rather the emotions show up on a panel in a different, higher level panel, where all these other impulses and perceptions compete for action that will reward the person and further their goals.",5.0,drjgardner,2024-06-19,9.0,14.0
1022789,No summary,"""Inside Out 2,"" directed by Kelsey Mann, brings audiences back into the vibrant and intricate world of Riley's emotions.

1022789,No summary,"The first Inside Out film was released 9 years ago (when Pixar made good films) and received nothing but glowing reviews. Reviews praised its original concept that did what Pixar used to do best, make films that are relatable and entertaining to both children and adults alike. Personally I had a hard time really connecting with the first film which is a shame as conceptually it seemed like something i would find easy to get on board with. Unfortunately though I think the oversimplification of such a complex part of the human brain meant I just didn't love it as much as other people seemed too.With that being said perhaps I'm not the best person to review this sequel as you'll undoubtedly enjoy this one to if you enjoyed the first film.For me however I have the same feelings about this one as I do the first.Riley is back but this time she's two years older and you know what that means, THE TERRIBLE TEENS!As anyone who's gone through puberty will know your emotions are all over the place at that time of your life which makes a perfect background for a sequel to a film that deals with emotions.This time Riley is off to hockey camp where she must decide between being loyal to her old friends or embracing her new ones and pushing the old ones aside. Her story throughout the film has been done time and time again but it's the emotions we are all here to see.One of the many things I was unsure about in the first film was how it portrayed the emotions as having control over Riley rather than the other way around. Yes sometimes we can loose control over our emotions like during puberty, but surely we should be encouraging kids to be in control over their emotions rather than the other way around by talking for instance. This time a bunch of new emotions have taken over and one particular emotion is front and centre but I won't say which as to avoid spoilers.The film then follows the original emotions as they try to regain control of the central console in Riley's brain.I felt the film re-treaded some of the same ground the first film covered to begin with, just with Riley being a bit older.As the film progressed I started to enjoy it a bit more and do feel the ending had a poignant message for young children to take away with them.",6.0,TomTalksFilms,2024-06-19,3.0,6.0

1022789,No summary,Now I just created this account this account to encourage anyone that's skeptical about seeing this movie to get up and go just go. I strongly believe this movie wasn't aimed for the audience of little kids it's aimed towards our generation us the new adults this movie hit and had me thinking about it hours after leaving the theaters it was fun emotional and had me engaged the whole time. Now I get people are saying this isn't magical like the first film and truth be told it's not. We had child like mindsets back then and carried it over hoping we'd feel what we felt the first time watching the first movie. And that's right it's not as magical but that's doesn't mean it's not better i thoroughly enjoyed the second one much more than first it's far more complex it's more relatable and this film now holds a special place in my heart. Younger kids will appreciate this movie more as they grow older they will and i may be overrating this movie but that's just how much it spoke to me. The humor was there. The emotions were there and most importantly the message was there. If they make a third one and I pray to god they do this will be the greatest pixar trilogy ever.

1022789,No summary,"There's been some debate around Pixar's Inside Out, namely on whether it was too complicated or too simplistic. It seemed pretty cerebral for a kiddie film, yet it regarded concepts of self, consciousness, and emotions in a way that's simplified enough that a child can understand it -- and by ""it"", I mean the movie; not actual human emotions.Is it bad to tell kids that their entire persona is governed by these magical beings inside their heads and that said beings properly represent the extent of how complex human emotions are -- that free will may be impossible and that all our feelings and desires are simply controlled by brightly colored critters voiced by NBC sitcom actors (whose squabbling is also all that is needed to explain/diagnose your mood swings and outbursts)? Well, I can't say I've met anyone whose kids seemed to turn out bad because of Inside Out.Still, these movies (yes, there's a sequel now, in case you hadn't guessed by clicking this review) do inevitably raise a lot of questions -- if not on the way they explain the mind, then in how human minds work in this particular universe.In this one, the sentient emotions inside the brain of young Riley Andersen -- Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Tony Hale as Fear, Liza Lapira as Disgust, and Lewis Black as Anger -- are visited by a slew of new emotions, including Ennui, Envy, and Anxiety, arriving as Riley enters teenhood. Their existence leaves us with much to ponder:For example, can Anxiety really be considered a distinct emotion? Using the terms supplied by the Inside Out-verse, isn't she just Fear with a dash of Sadness? What of Ennui? Could she be considered an off-shoot of Sadness, same as Nostalgia is a sort of bittersweet Joy? As for Envy, I believe there exists a better version of this script somewhere, where she is revealed to be a sin and not an emotion, ergo the other emotions need to cast her back into Hell.I do see the potential here. Making an Inside Out 2 with this premise makes sense -- in a way that's more important than whether its universe does: Those who grew up with the original Inside Out are no doubt at a time in their lives when they're going through the same changes and emotions as Riley is in this film. The idea of giving Inside Out a sequel -- and waiting until now to release it -- isn't bad.But it's not as poignant as Toy Story 3 (and certainly not as poignant as Toy Story 3 would've been if that's where the franchise actually stopped), nor does it ever approach anything that'd be ""too mature"", lest Disney be unable to widely market the film -- same as Riley and her story aren't ""too specific"". Emotional teens may be the ones who need this film; I am unsure if they will be the ones who like it. (I suspect kids and Disney Adults will be the biggest fans, especially as I'm sure the latter will somehow see success where I only see potential.)As for the various jokes involving concepts of self, memory, and personality and how they work in this subconscious control room, they were funnier the first time. I still enjoy the voice work -- especially from Ayo Edebiri and Maya Hawke this time -- and I suppose certain moments are touching, but they're usually rushed past so that we can get to the next item on the checklist. I shall also grant you that it's not a retread of the first film and that some of the new concepts are fairly interesting. To wit: Riley's mind realm now features a belief system, visualized in a way that's not dissimilar from the Jerry and Terry beings in Soul.In a world where Pixar has gone mask-off, admitting that they care more about ""mass appeal"" and marketability than letting individual creatives tell their stories (fearing that films like Luca and Turning Red are too alienating if you don't relate to the creators/protagonists, yet also forgetting how universally moving a personal tale can be), where does Inside Out 2 fit in? Is this a big-studio cash grab, a sincere work of art, or a case of the latter being concealed within the former, occasionally peeking forth?I dunno, but ohhh look at Embarrassment! Isn't he so precious? Don't you want to buy the plushie? Don't you want him on your bed next to all the porgs? Go see this movie, guys! No, you won't get more out of Turning Red! That wasn't a better and more genuine exploration of a young girl's coming-of-age emotionality or anything! In fact, we never made that! Shut up!

But what was missing was the reactions from the kids. My daughter might have a different view of it once she grows up a little but the current opinion was that it was fine. That seemed to be the consensus from most of the kids and father there as clearly they couldn't relate to events in the movie.For a non teen girl/grown woman, I thought the storyline was fine, predictable and boring but it is a kids movie. The animation and voice acting was great as always. But overall disappointing in my opinion given how good the first one was. It was a new, fresh idea and amazingly executed. There was something in there for everyone. The emotions go through this incredible adventure that reaches an end with character growth for the emotions themselves as well as Riley.I feel like that same sense of adventure and the character growth was missing.

Here we have so many missed opportunities to develop and write a good complex characters and story sacrificed for the trendy and marketing friendly options.The movie feels very flat, new characters are underderveloped and make little sense. All of them are derivatives from the original five and instead of developing, say Fear, more complex and nuanced, they go for the new, trendy, Anxiety. Etc.The parents had only the five emotions in the end of the first movie, do they not feel Anxiety?The animation is good but nothing to stand out, movement is natural and flawless but colours and shapes are quite uninspired. I am not a fan of the new characters designs, but they are not bad, just cliché. Their writing is bad.All in all, a very forgettable movie that lacks any of the Pixar magic.",,morkoff,2024-06-18,2.0,4.0
1022789,No summary,"Conceptually, I really like the core of this film.The creative depiction of how a personality is composed and develops (specially at our most vulnerable and demanding) shows a lot of depth and a lot of thoughts put into the script. A great artistic interpretation of ""puberty"", and an excellent reminder that we are all composed of all the different experiences and memories we've ever had, how we react to them, or core believes.. and how anxiety should not define who we are as a person.Compared to the original, you can see a different direction in execution. It is less explorative of the inside world that is our mind, but more on our reaction to the outside and a specific emotion. In that age where we become more self-reflective and intense. I still found the movie to be really thought-provoking, but the execution feels somewhat simplistic, even if not in a bad way. It also has some very fun moments, and even clever ideas (rumor mill). But aside from Anxiety, the other emotions are not well developed and end up being a tad forgettable in comparison.The ending is pretty satisfying and the overall delivery is charming enough to warrant a recommendation. I can definitely understand why it is doing as well in theaters as it is.",7.0,daisukereds,2024-06-18,4.0,5.0

The intricate emotional complexity being attempted in this movie through its narrative is just amazing.WALL-E has been my favorite Pixar film, and I'd say the two of them are equal in terms of ambition and the way they use the narrative storytelling in unique ways to explore their themes. But this film attempts and succeeds at achieving profound therapeutic and then almost overwhelming cathartic experience, in particular for girls seeing the film of Riley's age. My daughter was overcome by it, in a very bittersweet way.It's deep social commentary and study of human behavior successfully and seamlessly woven into mainstream filmmaking.

1022789,No summary,"The sequel to Inside Out soars high, introducing new emotions (anxiety, envy, shame, and boredom) that characterize an increasingly adult person. In this case, we witness the transition from a child to a teenager.The film shines in two key aspects: the first is its visual presentation, with stunning colors and graphic details in every scene. The second is the reflection and depth of the emotions it represents, which are the driving force behind our actions every moment of the day. Therefore, embracing oneself, understanding, and loving oneself, is incredibly relevant.""In today's world, we live in times of rapid and significant changes, and emotional stability is one of the goals that humanity yearns for. Among the various stages of a person's life, adolescence is both crucial and critical, as it is the period when there is an increasing awareness of internal feelings, and a constant struggle to achieve emotional balance. A young person's life is marked by both emotional and social aspects, which are also key, as there is a need to consolidate social relationships and build one's identity.""
The film captures this social aspect by showing how young people often experience strong influences to fit in with their peer group.Moreover, Pixar's creative talent ensures that the audience is thrilled with the appearance of nostalgic characters. It is admirable how they manage to bring everything together and make it align with the film's trajectory.In conclusion, the movie is an impressive, fun, and touching sequel with new emotions that explore the internal mechanisms of the human being and social relationships.",9.0,marccuenca42,2024-06-17,0.0,3.0

And I'd rather burn AND drown myself than sit through Elemental again. So it's with unbridled joy, and no sadness or anger, that I can say Inside Out 2 is a satisfying, clever delight. Riley's 13 now, which means a whole new gang of emotions like Envy and Embarrassment have popped into her head. Before you can say panic attack, anxiety starts ruling the roost. I won't spoil the rest, but what unfolds is a satisfying and funny adventure that's really meaningful too. From the concept of self-belief, to super clever visual gags like a brainstorm and a sar-chasm, the thinkers at Pixar have dug deep to take complicated concepts and bring them to physical life. Inside Out 2 is a winner, and it just smashed the international animation record for the biggest opening weekend of all time. So bring on the threequel.

The theme can be a little complex for younger audience. However the writers mange to keep it simple, funny and emotional. All the classic signs of a truly good Pixar movie. I loved the introduction of the new characters, and found them all to be likable in there on way. You could understand the motivation of each character, and none of them were over the top and outstayed their welcome ""Except nostalgia"" :-) The ending was great too.

I don't have a lot of problems with the story, just some nitpicks. For example, some characters appear halfway through the movie that i expected to see in the climax but i saw only one of them. Like i said, not a big problem. Speaking of the characters, they all had a respectful amount of screen time and they all stood out accept maybe Envy, i didn't find her all that compelling.The direction wasn't anything groundbreaking and the editing was really fast paced - there were constant cuts, zooms etc. Just to keep the little kids stimulated because of their tragically low attention spam. Personally, i didn't have a problem with it, if anything, that kept everyone in the theatre concentrated but if this trend of ""brain rot editing"" continuous, it will be a problem.The voice actors on the other hand, did their job good and everyone was amazing. Now, some people from the cast are replaced but i didn't have a problem with it.The animation was also incredible, even for Pixar standarts. They experimented with some different types of animation, maybe inspired by ""Spider-verse"" and it worked really well.Overall, this movies is fast paced, entertaining, emotional and overall, really good.

1022789,No summary,"'Inside Out 2 (2024)' is a colourful sequel that focuses on the next stage of Riley's development: becoming a teenager. Along with that change comes new emotions, chief among them anxiety. It has become somewhat of a trope for modern media to include representations of anxiety - and panic attacks, in particular - and it's easy to write off its inclusion as an attempt to cash in on what's 'trendy' (some films simply don't warrant its inclusion and handle it really clumsily because of that), but this is the perfect forum for it. The film is able to incorporate anxiety and dive into the importance of maintaining good mental health, presenting the emotion as something perhaps a little difficult to control but still as vital as everything else going on in your head. While the character essentially acts as the antagonist, she isn't a villain; she has Riley's best intentions at heart, after all. The flick is able to showcase her as both friend and foe in a way that feels really true to life, and ultimately follows in the footsteps of its predecessor in positing that a more complex internal life is what's needed for a more complex external one. That is to say, the movie isn't about eradicating anxiety, but rather learning to work with it. It's a good - and important - message and it's delivered really well.Pixar know how to make an emotionally resonant story, and this is no exception. The cathartic climax is so affecting it brings tears to your eyes. The problem is that this resonance doesn't last very long, and it's easy to wonder if the emotionality is somewhat cheap because of it. Is it just a combination of the right music and the right sentimental dialogue, or is there something deeper going on? Is there something more universally true and profound being said? While I do think that there genuinely is poignance to be found here, it's somewhat disappointing that it doesn't stick with you for as long as you'd expect. The studio have managed occupy your brain and heart for much longer in the past, and there's a sense that much of this effort is ever so slightly throwaway. This is a minor complaint, though, because the fact that the flick is able to make you feel something - truly feel something - is definitely admirable. Furthermore, it's something that will likely hit home a lot harder for those who truly need to see it. While it still works as a universal experience, it naturally aims a little older than the previous picture. As such, it will probably act as a good tool for pre-teens / young teens experiencing similar changes to Riley to better understand their own situation, and perhaps act as a catalyst between them and the parents they're maybe reluctant to talk about these new feelings with.In terms of actual plotting, the piece is pretty conventional. It follows the established formula almost exactly as it's written, never truly surprising or subverting cliché. In a way, though, that simply makes it more efficient at delivering its themes and doing so in a fun, bouncy, lighthearted fashion that balances levity with weight in a way that ensures everyone in the audience will remain engaged. It doesn't talk down to anyone - except in a purposefully knowing way that doesn't really count because it winks so hard while it does it - but it doesn't overcomplicate things, either. The characters develop slightly over the course of the story, even if things sometimes feel a little bit rushed, and there are a variety of entertaining set-pieces that coincide with the more drama-focused external elements which influence them. The film incorporates a variety of puns to represent internal processes such as thought (brainstorms) or instinct (sarcasm), and it's always enjoyable when one of these clever visuals pops up. The picture is fairly funny on occasion, too, and the voice work is strong across the board.In the end, this is an entertaining sequel with lively animation, vibrant visuals, intelligent concepts, important messages and lots of heart. It's emotionally resonant and fairly profound in its own accessible way. It's a really good effort.",7.0,Pjtaylor-96-138044,2024-06-17,0.0,2.0

""Riley"" is still happily coasting through family life until one day, she embarks on the yellow brick road that is puberty. Towit, her control gallery is no longer the purview of just her lifelong guides like ""Fear"", ""Joy"" and ""Anger"" - now she has also to deal with the likes of disgust, envy, boredom and worst of all - anxiety. It's maybe the latter that the film should be called as we now embark on quite a humourless swipe at the culture of validation that young people must navigate. It's all about being popular. Being liked. Being the best - in the ice hockey team. Old loyalties go under the bus in favour of new aspirations and yes, much of it does ring quite true as an evaluation of the fickleness in all of us. Thing is, though, there's just too much inevitability about what comes next and there's way too much incessant dialogue. ""Anger"" has some fun along the way, and there is the odd comedy one-liner from the laconic ""Ennui"" but it just didn't resonate with me at all. The animation is standard Pixar fayre that does the job colourfully but unremarkably, and by the conclusion I was hoping there was an off button on that great big console. Yep - I'm probably too old to really appreciate this the way the kids can, but the trick for these studios has to be to engage the adults at the same time as the weans, else out come the mobile phones as our own version of ennui sets in.

Promoted as an entertaining event that lasts one and a half hours, it has a problem with a story. It introduces Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear again who travel through teenage Riley's mind, but it is not as profound as the first movie. While pacing appears to be slow with large chunks where not much story occurs and the audience is not able to form a bond with the character. Although the first film was emotional and deeply meaningful, ""Inside Out 2"" lacks a single, overarching message compared to its predecessor. The humor and warmth are insufficient to make up for the shoddy plot, even though some of the animation and voice acting are excellent.

1022789,No summary,"What I liked:
The highlights of this movie are its relatable themes and the childlike creativity that went into its prototyping. The new characters have funny yet discriminating character traits; ideas about 'fitting in' and 'growing up' are elegantly encapsulated in the new theme of a 'belief system'; and there were literal 'sar-chasms' and 'brain-storms' and imagination factories...I also noticed the high-quality of animation & colour theory, which was subtle, yet communicative: when Riley feels out of place, the movie visually communicates to you that she feels out of place.What could've been better:
I just can't help but feel like the movie overpromises but underdelivers. We had the addition of 4 new characters - ennui, envy, embarrassment and anxiety - but since only anxiety had any impact on the plot, the other 3 characters felt redundant and useless.It just feels like they began the animation process with only half the plot thought out. Characters aside, I also thought certain scenes felt makeshift and unnatural, as if they were to squeeze a pear shaped idea through an apple shaped hole; the final takeaway message is the prime example of this - personally, though I thought it was relevant and moving, I also thought it was an unintuitive logical leap. The themes are relatable, the ideas are creative, but there's just this unshakable feeling of synthetic-ness to the big pictureSynopsis:
Very enjoyable, but a lot of unrealized potential in my opinion. Which is a shame, because this easily could've been a 8.5/10 or even a 9/10 for me. But definitely give it a watch - it's pretty creative, and it's unquestionably one of the better movies this year.",6.0,lei_lei1,2024-06-17,17.0,9.0

Inside Out 2 continues that experience, taking you inside the mind of the mind as it transitions from child into emerging adult. That the filmmakers again consulted professionals is obvious, because the story is so relatable to so many, and captures the complexity of the emotional battle we all experience.

The concept of teenager growing up is not new, but Inside Out 2 has a very well crafted storyline that does not make the movie cliche' or boring at all.

One of the highlight that I didn't expect from the first movie was the introduction of Bing Bong and I was bawling my eyes out for him. Although Inside Out 2 didn't quite have that emotional character, but the story of a teenage friendship with their ups and downs really make it relevant. If the first movie is 10/10, then the second one is a solid 9. I did find it was rushed at points and the journey was not as gripping as the first movie, but this is to be expected from a sequel.

Mostly because I never dealt with the moving experience she had in the first movie but all the thoughts that keep you awake at night is very understandable and I loved how much people who grew up with the first movie can relate to the second because it grows up with you.The only thing I wish we got a little bit more of was Embarrassment speaking but that did make the moment where he spoke for the first time all the more eager to see.

Overall, a pretty good movie that accurately shows the pubescent mind's changing emotions in a beautifully vibrant way, but is a step back from its predecessor as they introduce too many new ideas and do not do a good job explaining them.Direction: Pretty Good
The direciton on a macroscale is great as they continue to build this vibrant world inside the mind, and they go even further this time with more stunning visuals; the direction on a microscale this time is pretty good as it continues to personify the original emotions, but is a step back from its predessor as they do not do a good job in directing the new emotions or connecting different elements together; the storytelling is a bit more convoluted this time around as they try to incorporate too many things, and because of this, the movie feels a bit more shallow; they build tension well, especially in the climax when there is a rush of emotionsStory: Pretty Good
The concept is good as it deals with Riley navigating through Puberty, and does a good job in showing how her mind changes because of it; the plot structure is not as strong this time around as it tries to jam in too many new things, and because of that it does not do a good job introducing or closing new points (especially in the exposition with the 'belief' system); character writing is not as strong this time around as it feels like the characters did not learn anything from the last movie, except for sadness, and the new emotions do not feel as nuanced or are accurately written (like anxiety as a character)Screenplay: Good
The dialogue is still pretty strong and is filled with many profound lines (especially towards the end); the try to be funny way more this time around, and they do a good job at it because a lot of the jokes are genuniely funny; the symbolism is still profound as they do a good job showing the impact puberty has on new and exisitng emotions, and they do a great job dealing with anxiety as a concept; the foreshadowing is pretty good, but not as good as the previous movie as it does not feel like all the loose ends are tied upActing: Pretty Good
Amy Poehler: Great (Continues where she left off as she embodies the delusional protective nature of Joy in trying to do what's best for Riley)
Maya Hawke: Decent (Does not feel as strong of a performace as the rest of the cast as she does not really personify anxiety that well, but still holds her own)
Kensington Tallman: Pretty Good (Does a pretty good job in showing how Riley is changing and going through puberty)
Liza Lapira: Decent (Not as strong of a performance as Mindy Kaling, but still holds her own)
Tony Hale: Pretty Good (Not as strong of a performance as Bill Hader, but still holds his own)
Lewis Black: Very Good (Continues where he left off in the previous film as he is even more animated and given more material to work with to provide more comedy to the movie)
Phyllis Smith: Great (Still a very strong performance for the franchise as she is given more of a leadership role this time around, but is not given as much screentime to show her significance to Riley)
Ayo Edebiri: Decent (Does not really use her personality for the character, but this is becasue the character is very blandly written)
Rest of the cast: Decent to Pretty Good (The rest of the returning cast is fine as they use their experience to shape their character, but the new cast memembers really just give formualic pixar line delievery)Score: Good
Just reuses a lot of the same themes from the previous movieEditing: GreatSound: Very GoodVisual Effects: Brilliant
Incredibly vibrant and corlorful as they use improved technology to take this world to a whole knew level, and the visuals are so stunning and beautiful; it is pretty evident they used 'Uncut Gems' as a visual inspirationPacing
Pacing is bit of a mess because the exposition and rising action feel very rushed from adding too many new things, but the climax feels like it adjusts to the right paceClimax
Climax is incredibly profound as it feels like they finally got their footing and handle the overarching conflcit very well (and it is a very realistic and nuanced way to handle the topic)Tone

1022789,No summary,"So close to a perfect 10* but the plot for kids was pretty complex maybe a tiny amount too much but my 8 and 11 year olds loved it. Wife and I thought it was wonderful.Very funny, very clever, fascinating concepts and the sense of Self or Beliefs was explained/suggested so well. A good wholesome movie with none of the PC brigade having to subvert any traditional morals.The coming of age for our 10yesr hit rather close to home and was actually very meaningful and relevant to moving to secondary school for example. A pleasant surprise to such a good piece of animated story telling finally coming out of the very troubled and bizarre efforts from Disney over the last decade. Perhaps Pixar will survive after all. Wonderful story telling, great characters and loads of comic relief from a pretty serious subject. Prepare your children but take them to see it asap.",9.0,alex-achucarro,2024-06-16,1.0,8.0
1022789,No summary,"Inside out 2 talks about how when we grow up we get with more sophisticated emotions and feel overwhelmed and as if no matter what we do nothing is enough.Anxiety takes a huge role in this movie which is what makes it so relatable and touching,anxiety kept overthinking about the possibilities and what the future may hold while pushing raylee past her limits (if I spelt her name right lmfao) which makes it more relatable because most of us teenagers feel this way and push ourselves past our limits to achieve something and do all we can and more to make it happen.I was shocked when the movie finished because I didn't expect to love it more than the first part.The movie is easily a 10/10 it made me cry a lot because of how relatable it is.",10.0,Hm09_b,2024-06-16,4.0,11.0

1022789,No summary,"In 2015, we met Riley and her developing emotions Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust the first time and it was a ride. Now a teenager approaching puberty is bringing in some new emotions to the headquarters.The new emotions that take over Riley's psyche include Anxiety and Envy, who turn out to be the new movers and shakers of Riley's mindset. Embarrassment, Ennui and Nostalgia are more in the background, but they all play an indispensable role in one way or another. I cannot praise Pixar enough in coming up with this high-concept distinction between basic emotions and sophisticated emotions. Anxiety and Envy are a frenetic and unwieldy tandem who are initially ahead of the curve in gauging Riley's social and athletic challenges. At their first, they work brilliantly together in steering Riley's decision-making process, vaulting her into contention for a spot on an elite hockey team with the only coolest kids. That's when the film's insight on controlling these kinds of emotions starts to gel. Teenage angst, indeed anxiety in general, is a double-edged sword which can be a valuable asset in foreseeing what is to come but the film ultimately has a lot more to say than just that.It is a fun ride to see the struggle we adults went through some time ago from a funny and relatable and still different perspective. Amy Poehler gives Joy again a vibrant and wonderfully fitting voice. Anxiety gets her voice from Maya Hawke and nails it.Great fit are all the voices for the emotions, one of my favorites stays Liza Lapira as Disgust along with Adele Exarchopoulos as Ennui. Director Kelsey Mann makes Disney and Pixar's ""Inside Out 2"" a joyride for all ages with lots of fun, jokes and nostalgia. Highly recommended to everyone!Note: Be sure to watch the film through the credits because Pixar, true to form, has a postscript that most people will miss.",10.0,PotassiumMan,2024-06-16,1.0,10.0
1022789,No summary,"This is for anxty teenagers and 20 somethings. Thats who I think Disney was aiming for. Adults will be bored, kids will be bored, but teens will LOVE IT.Which kind of makes sense,e as the movie makes that age group sound a lot better then they really are. Pandering might not be too strong a word.The whole concept is far too complicated from anyone under 13, and far too cutesy for anyone over 25. Anyone in that 15 to 25 age group will likely love this story. Well, I didnt love it, but I know what Disney was going for. Extra points if your hair is blue and you adore pronouns. Then this movie is just written especially for you. Go get a ticket.Although Im not the right audience for a movie about feelings, I did NOT LIKE he message. The fact is; YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE FEELINGS OF OTHER PEOPLE MORE, AND YOUR OWN FEELINGS LESS. Today's we teach our kids to seek their own happiness so hard, they can never find it. Helping other people, especially the people in your own family is often the right way to find that happiness. GIVING RESPECT, especially to people you might not agree with is more important then damnding it for yourself. SELFISHNESS is NOT a good thing.How many times have people excused cruel and callous actions with ""Well, I couldnt' ignore my feelings!"" YES YOU CAN IGNORE YOUR FEELINGS! And when your happiness costs other people, thats exactly what you should do.I guess I find emotions to be a boring subject matter even in other films that are actually about something, so I probably wasn't the intended audience. Honestly, if youre an emotional young woman, you will be happy with this film.Edit; I think this film is quite cute for what it is. But I wanted to add that I wouldn't have gone to see this film if I knew what I know about Disny and their terribly unfair and illegal hiring practices now. I found out after I went to see this. I wont say more here, but those who know know, and those who dont look it up. Let's just say this is about the Civil Rights Act.

Anxiety exiles Riley's old emotions to the memory hole and begins to rewrite her personality.There's a lot to be pleased at with this sequel to Pixar's hit of 2015, even if I think there's some padding in the middle to bring it up to 96 minutes.

1022789,No summary,"When Inside Out was released in 2015, it was quickly hailed as one of Pixar's Masterpieces and it really was. It's a story about growing up, developing and feeling your emotions. And as humans we never stop growing or developing into a more mature version of ourselves, so a sequel to the first movie seemed pretty much a guaranteed bet. And 9 years later, here we are as Inside Out 2 is currently playing in theatres.Inside Out is my favourite Pixar movie of all time so I was a little anxious about how are they gonna possibly top the first or even come close. But luckily it was AMAZING!!!The writing is pretty great and perfectly showcases the chaos of adolescence, the desire to desperately fit in, thinking that you're not good enough, and what happens when anxiety completely takes over you (both literally and figuratively), all while still being so incredibly cute and funny. The animation is marvelous and so hyper detailed. I loved that they combined different animation styles like video game animation and 2D animation for some characters which looked so good. The characters are fun and the old and new emotions are utilised evenly throughout the story. Out of the new emotions, Anxiety was the standout. Another new character which I thought was pretty good and funny was Pouchy. The voice acting is done brilliantly particularly by Amy Poehler as Joy, Lewis Black as Anger, Liza Lapira as Disgust and ofcourse Maya Hawke as Anxiety. The world building is stunning as always particularly the Belief System. The concept of Riley's Sense of Self was really intriguing and holds a deep meaning. I also really loved the messaging about loving every bit of yourself just as you are.However, the movie doesn't quite hit the emotional beats of the first movie and dragged a little during the second half, but that's just a minor nitpick.Overall, Inside Out 2 is beautiful, heartwarming and funny. The writing is clever, the animation is marvelous, the characters are fun and the message is strong. This is Pixar's return to form and easily one their best sequels to date that holds up to the original. Don't miss the chance to watch it in theatres.",9.0,anchitbaishya2004,2024-06-16,1.0,6.0

The voice actors did a commendable job, and I have no complaints in that area. The animation was good, though it seemed a bit basic at times.On the downside, the movie feels like a complete repeat of the original.

When we left Riley and her emotions, she was still a little kid. Now she's a teenager. For most teenagers, an entire new batch of emotions takes over. Inside Out 2 interprets this by having the original 5 displaced in a coup led by the well-meaning, but controlling Anxiety: who looks like Ickis from Aaahh! Real Monsters. This film is spilling out of its seams with inspiration. You really don't mind getting lost in the world of emotions. But most importantly, this film has retained its irresistible sweetness.

1022789,No summary,"Pixar's summer sequel, Inside Out 2, explores normative social influence and introduces a Gallic character called Ennui, only to give him a nickname (Wee Wee) guaranteed to make under-10s giggle. The film follows the Andersen family, who possess brains controlled by five emotions. As Riley turns 13 and acquires whiffy armpits, a new feeling, Anxiety, takes control of headquarters. With the help of Envy, Embarrassment, and Ennui, Anxiety muzzles Amy Poehler's Joy, allowing Riley to pass as cool during an ice-hockey summer camp. The plot creates a sense of deja vu, with the indefatigable cheerleader Joy learning about painful memories and the subtle message that tribalism is toxic. The pressure to belong to a winning team leads to a panic-attack sequence as moving and visually inventive as anything in those impeccable Pixar spin-offs Toy Story 2 and 3. It's hard not to sob as Riley's anguished inner voice hammers home a newly forged belief (that she's a failure) and Anxiety, frozen with terror, inside a dense, fluorescent-orange forest of looping thoughts. Pixar's Inside Out 2 is a sequel that delivers a sincere narrative, combined with humor and stunning visuals, that still won over the audience. The sequel returns to Riley's mind and brings in more emotions as she hits puberty. Riley is now 13, and her headquarters continue to hold the OG emotions of Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Tony Hale, replacing Bill Hader), and Disgust (Liza Lapira, replacing Mindy Kaling). On the way to hockey camp, Riley gets unexpected news that throws high school plans into uncertainty. Before Joy and her expressive posse know it, new emotions are in the mix, including Anxiety (voiced by Maya Hawke). Anxiety wriggles Riley out of a problem Joy only amplified, and she decides that more of her emotions are necessary. With Anxiety at the helm, teenage Riley shrinks herself to fit in with older hockey kids, especially top player Valentina.The storyline mirrors the essence of the first film, with characters on a journey to return to headquarters to rescue Riley. The quest includes new stops, such as a prisonlike place that holds Riley's secrets and in the back of her mind, where Joy has been chucking scores of Riley's bad memories. Between Anxiety's and Joy's meddling, there's quite a bit impacting their sporty, blonde host. Early on, an interesting new addition to the setting is introduced: Riley's system of beliefs, which connects to her sense of self, a structure of glowing, overlapping hoops in headquarters. Inside Out 2 is a sequel to the beloved animated series, featuring new characters such as Envy, Embarrassment, and Ennui. The characters' behavior, such as Embarrassment tightening his hoodie and anxiety pounding energy drinks, adds humor to the story. Sadness, whose affinity to flopping down on hard surfaces never gets old, gets more action in the sequel, but could have used more of Ennui. Pouchy, a wacky new sidekicklike character, also appears a few times. The visuals are stunning, with detailed animation that makes it feel like the solid-colored cartoon characters could step off the screen at any moment. The conversations between Anxiety and Joy are the most compelling, as they debate what is best for Riley. The sequel may seem familiar to fans, but with effective humor, incredible animation, and a willingness to explore a relevant new message.",10.0,moviesfilmsreviewsinc,2024-06-16,1.0,6.0

1022789,No summary,"In 2015, ""Inside Out"" first graced our screens and captured the hearts and minds of its audiences worldwide, from kids to adults, becoming an instant classic with its innovative exploration of human emotions through the lens of the young Riley and the complex relationship between Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust. Fast forward to 2024, and Pixar's much-anticipated sequel, ""Inside Out 2,"" arrives to expand this emotional landscape further and now introduces new emotions: Embarrassment, Envy, Ennui, and Anxiety. While these new emotions may be uncomfortable to explore, ""Inside Out 2"" takes a more mature route in displaying these emotions by portraying a more profound exploration of emotional intelligence with slightly different audiences in mind.The standout aspect of the movie is its bold decision to introduce Anxiety as a pivotal and central emotion, alongside Envy, Ennui, and Embarrassment. The thing is, the movie did not try to shy away from the complexity of these emotions, especially with their exploration of Anxiety, which was portrayed with remarkable depth and sensitivity that everyone can relate to. The narrative begs the question, ""Is Anxiety a bad thing?"" and the movie answers it with a thoughtful exploration of how Anxiety, just like all emotions, serves a purpose in human emotions. It's not just about suppressing these feelings but understanding that these uncomfortable emotions---like Envy, Embarrassment, Ennui, and Anxiety---are meant to be felt. Additionally, Pixar's animation has always been top-notch, and ""Inside Out 2"" is no exception. The attention to detail is remarkable, from the intricate designs of the characters' dresses to the nuanced expressions that convey their emotional states. These small details enhance the storytelling, making the emotional experiences of the characters more vivid and relatable.The film's brave portrayal of Anxiety is particularly praiseworthy. We often view anxiety as a negative emotion, something to be avoided or stamped out. However, ""Inside Out 2"", offers a refreshing perspective that Anxiety is a natural part of growing up and an essential component of our emotional repertoire. These emotions teach Riley---and by extension, the audience---that being comfortable with our anxiety and the rest of our emotions is crucial in growing up. This message is especially relevant for teenagers and even adult audiences, who often struggle with heightened emotional states as they navigate through the unstable and overwhelming waters of adolescence. Even the movie's clever description of puberty as ""messy"" resonates deeply with teen and adult audiences. For kids, it might be hard to understand this reference, but this depiction is both clever and relevant, capturing the chaotic and often overwhelming experience of growing up. The film's ability to communicate and relay that our emotions, even the uncomfortable and messy ones, do not define us but are part of our life journey, is profoundly impactful and relevant. This clever storytelling has allowed the audiences to embrace the complexity of our emotions rather than suppressing them---a message that is both timely and timeless.While it is worth noting that ""Inside Out 2"" is targeted at younger audiences, it sometimes misses the mark in connecting with them, especially with the kids. Unlike the first installment, the humor and themes were universally relatable, while the sequel's jokes and themes have become more mature, often suited better for adult audiences. This shift could be seen as a drawback, it was evident in theaters that some kids missed the jokes while the adults were laughing, and this could alienate younger audiences who may find the content hard to grasp. However, this mature approach is also the film's greatest strength as it opens up new opportunities for parents to have a meaningful conversation with their kids about these emotions, making it a valuable tool for another emotional education. When we look at it, anxiety is not inherently bad; it's a universal experience, and the movie depicted Anxiety with a much broader understanding of the emotion in real life. It's a scientific fact that there are only two types of people who don't feel anxious---those with certain psychiatric conditions, or what people call ""crazy,"" and those who are dead. This perspective underscores anxiety as a neutral emotion and can be used as a motivator and a protector in real life. Anxiety is what makes us care about how we look, how we perform, and how we interact with others. In this light, Anxiety is not a villain but a guide, helping us navigate the complexities of life.In comparison to its predecessor, ""Inside Out 2"" does not quite reach the same emotional depths the same way ""Inside Out"" did. The first installment was groundbreaking in exploring the complex relationship between Joy and Sadness, delivering an emotional punch that resonated very well with audiences of all ages. While the sequel may have not reached the same level of emotional height, the film compensates with its maturity and intellectual depth. The film has somehow captured the charm and ingenuity of the first movie while also delving into more sophisticated and complicated themes, making it an important addition to the franchise. Although the movie may have lost some of the spark and joy that were characterized by the first installment, the film stands strong on its own merits. But the movie's maturity and profound exploration of emotions is what makes this a triumphant film. The movie reminds the audiences once again of the importance of not suppressing these natural aspects of ourselves. The movie may have revisited the old themes, but they did it in a manner that feels fresh and relevant, particularly in the way they handle ""Anxiety"".In conclusion, ""Inside Out 2"" is a clever, entertaining, and deeply thoughtful addition to the franchise that builds on the legacy of its predecessor while carving out its own unique space. The movie may not be as universally accessible and understandable in comparison to the first movie, but its mature themes and profound messages make the movie an important and valuable sequel. By encouraging viewers to embrace their emotions, particularly Anxiety, the film offers a compelling narrative that is about the complexity of human emotions and the importance of emotional balance. At its heart, the film's portrayal of Anxiety serves as a powerful reminder that this emotion, though oftentimes unpleasant and uncomfortable to sit with, is actually an essential aspect of growing up. The movie teaches both teenagers and parents that Anxiety is not something to fear about but has to be understood and embraced. This message is crucial in today's fast-paced, high-pressure world, where emotional well-being is often overlooked and misunderstood.",7.0,jaysonpajaronvistal,2024-06-16,1.0,6.0
1022789,No summary,"While this can be watched and enjoyed as a standalone film, I would highly recommend watching the first part beforehand. The reason being is that the first film does all the world building and explains all its components in detail. That's not to say this is made more confusing without it but it makes for a better experience. One of those experiences is revisiting places from the first movie and seeing how they have changed as Riley has aged. New elements are also introduced such as beliefs and secrets.The film maintains the integrity of each the characters from the first film while still introducing new and interesting characters. Anxiety gets the most screen time out of all the new characters and some might see that as a negative. But it makes sense that that's the emotion that one would deal with on a higher level than the other new emotions introduced.Anxiety is a big theme in this film and while some might feel it is not suitable for children or that children might not fully comprehend what is going on I don't think that makes this film inappropriate in any way. It's a film that helps us understand ourselves and even our children and how to address these emotions that they may feel. It's a movie that deals with real life issues and that's part of what makes it so great and relatable. This film still manages to keep its characters likeable for children. They don't feel like adult characters they just deal with more mature themes.The film is fast paced and entertaining throughout. The animation is great and even some of the characters are given their own animation style. The humor is also blended well without feeling forced. The voice acting is also very well done. This film is on par with the first and should be given a watch.",8.0,moviemanmo973,2024-06-16,1.0,6.0

Ayo Edebiri and Maya Hawke are great additions to the cast and add to the wacky sense of humor illustrated through Riley. Good laughs and relatable moments gave the movie a more broad appeal, as do most Pixar movies. Riley's coming of age is so cleverly executed and there's a sense of excitement to the story. It's good enough as its predecessor, yet stands on its own in telling a similar tale. I would definitely recommend this to any kids itching for another fun movie memory.

Even brought a tear to my eye at the end. Phenomenal movie that I will be watching again at some point. And as always I appreciate the peak into the parents' brains, even though brief.

This movie and its previous one did absolutely fantastic with showing emotions. It's better than those puberty info shows back in the 90's they showed in class. Crazy how a kids movie can make me cry. It's extremely hard for a movie nowadays to make me sad or tear up but this one did it because of it being comparable! Tough hard depressing times of being a teenager and having anxiety attacks and not knowing how to cool it down. You guys did a well job here. Only downs were that there seemed to be problem after problem after problem that built up for the original emotions. Not really understanding the point of the dark secrets other than using the Fanny pack at the end. It was going super great until like 75% into it where it started to go slow with problems.But at other times I could resonate with anxiety. Like during the teens years it is hard to be happy and suppressed emotions will occur.

1022789,No summary,"I never thought I would see the day that Inside Out would get a sequel. But it has given a very good reason to give it a second film. Inside Out 2 is debatably as incredible as the first movie. As this follows up with Riley as a teenager, the story was able to upgrade into something that makes the world building even bigger. Not only that there's more to Riley's mind, but that especially goes to how the new emotions were portrayed after she hit puberty and plays out on what happens if Anxiety takes over her life. This would give the characters a lot of new personality traits both old and new. And the animation is as strong as ever. If you love the first film, I think you're going to enjoy this as much. I definitely recommend watching this. Would we ever get another movie and get us some new emotions as Riley becomes matures more? Honestly, we'll never know.

Everything we want to repress, everything we throw away to the back of our head will come to bite us in the behind. All of these shameful or cringeworthy memories need to be accepted to our consciousness and then gracefully let go. Otherwise the anxiety will consume us.",10.0,anna-majcher,2024-06-15,76.0,40.0
1022789,No summary,"The first inside out was a very innovative fun experience. Hollywood seldom comes up with new stuff, so it is fun to be part of a ride which is actually kinda unique. This sequel does the same thing, but now Riley has grown to 13yo. Another great thing about both of these movies is that they excellently capture the age of Riley. In this one they excellently portrait growing up and understanding and accepting all parts of ourselves.Puberty, school, social pressure, growing up, friendship and brilliantly told with a witty fun script. Following with this young girl we can all relate to her, even if you are a middle-age man as I am.If I am going to criticise something it is that the movie seldom hits the 100% mark. This is great all throughout, but it never becomes fantastic. I also think this is less funny than the first one. And finally I am not completely sure this will resonate with the audience i.e. Young teens and teenagers, but looking at the box office, so far, I seem to be wrong.Great family movie and great sequel. I give it a 8/10 and highly recommend for the whole family. This is a fun watch, and I am very happy to be able to say that about a movie again.

1022789,No summary,"LIKES:The AnimationThe Character DevelopmentThe Emotional DevelopmentBalance of Inside and OutCleverFunny At TimesCuteDecent PaceGreat Voice ActingUsed All The Characters Pretty EvenlySUMMARY:In terms of likes, Inside Out 2 is summarized as the usual Pixar magic with the modern-day approach of Disney's studio agenda. The animation is gorgeous with vivid colors, immaculate curves and angles, and fluid movements that are now an expectation for the studio to keep. It's eye-catching and stimulating, easily hypnotizing most of the younger members in my showing, but yet clever in design so that older fans can be entertained by the usual wit Pixar's cleverness brings. Both inside and outside of Riley keep to the themes, still being that cartoonish style for the humans, but somehow playing with light and shadow to add that flare that we love in a Disney production. It all plays a solid part in eliciting the emotions they are going for and is almost as much of a character as the literal characters themselves.As for the story and characters, this is where most of the movie is going to shine in my opinion. The second installment's story does a nice summary and introduction to the transitions in a fun montage, but quickly throws a wrecking ball into things that introduce the new emotions. From there, the movie becomes one part adventure and two parts emotion, in a delicate dance that is reflected in both inside and outside events to what I loved in the first film. Many of the emotions get some level of character development, alongside Riley who has complexity that is just as complicated as the age range the trailers have fixated on for the past few months. Yet, the emotional dive is the biggest development of the movie, with various scenarios coming that strummed the nostalgic strings of growing up and bombarded the relevant elements that added to the experience. It's a roller coaster that is deep and entertaining for viewers like me, moving at a decent pace that brings comedy, cleverness, storytelling, and cuteness into one vibrant package. The voice acting further adds to the mixture, sometimes being done to levels that had me envisioning the actors experiencing this pain as they delivered their lines to shockingly accurate degrees. All the emotions get shockingly balanced time, nine characters, plus Riley, actually having importance for inclusion and giving me adequate time with every emotion, which many studios fail to accomplish. All of this was very surprising to a degree given the amount of delays and controversy with this movie, but Mann's direction with her writers has made a story that is very relevant and somehow still holding some of the Pixar 90s-2000s adventure that for a while has been gone.DISLIKES:Less Creative World BuildingThe Antagonist Is More Metaphorical Than A ThreatMore Contributions By Some Characters Could Have Been DoneThe Adventure Is Okay, Yet Still MundaneThe RetconningRelevance Plays A Big KeySummary:
Where some of the cuts and costs of this balanced emotional tale come in the cost of the adventure and creative elements though. Maybe it's the teenage years and the metaphorical development that comes with growing older in some, but Inside Out's second ordeal didn't quite have the same creativity and unique flavor that the first did. The layout changes, but kind of in the laziest way possible with only a few moments being humorous more than wow. Even the antagonist and threat are less stellar than Joy's monster and Bing-Bong's shifting direction, as the new waves are again more a relevant force than a truly unique character. It leads to the adventure part being a bit blander and superficial, the excitement ebbed by very flash-in-the-pan moments and exaggerated jokes that fit well in the modern era. Some characters could have had more, Disgust needing to do more than just sound like a Valley Girl, or Fear maybe adding a little more protection or something, but that's a nitpicky component that ties back to other areas to get Riley through puberty. And true there are story misfires and changing an entire structure that is a bit farfetched to make the new belief system work, but they are easily overlooked in the long run. Perhaps the biggest thing I can warn, is that relevance and relatability may be more of a motivating factor for people to enjoy this movie that might sway the review scores one way or another.The VERDICT:
Inside Out 2 is a movie that has been timed beautifully given the current timing of the year and the lack of animation movies for at least the next three weeks. Much like the first movie, it hits hard in both emotional/poetic glory with the same fun adventure that Pixar proves it still has despite a focus on realistic stories. I loved the balance to many degrees, and because of my own relevance with these emotions and characters had extra levels that enhanced my viewing experience. With a great blend of acting, design, animation, and storytelling, despite not paying attention or explaining some key factors being changed, the movie does accomplish much for the targeted audience group and the supporting group around them. True, the adventure lacks some of the originality, cleverness, and obstacles that add spice to a movie that I enjoy and want Pixar to return to. However, the movie was worth a theater visit, with only the animation style's colors being the 3-D nature of the movie. I'd check this one out if you can get a chance, but also I won't call this the best sequel or Pixar movie ever.My scores are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0

1022789,No summary,"You're never truly done growing up so a sequel to Inside Out 2 makes complete sense but at the same time it initially feels like a cynical idea. So it's a real testament to the team at Pixar that the end result has none of that cynicism with a sequel that's wholeheartedly worthy of the original. It's essentially Inside Out again with an almost equally impactful emotional core.All the returning emotions remain faultless with Amy Poehler getting another satisfying arc in which she realises how draining being constantly joyful can be. Even though Tony Hale and Liza Lapira aren't seamless replacements for Fear and Disgust they still do a great job of embodying those emotions. All the new emotions are perfectly chosen though, especially Maya Hawke as anxiety.Kelsey Mann's direction along with the screenplay by returning writer Meg LeFauve and Dave Holstein really brings the imagination once again.

And taking the focus away from family, toward a simple, trivial hockey camp? Talk about lowering the stakes.Basically boring, pointless, and much less fun. The changes in voice actors were jarring, and the additions were messy and for the most part useless. Anxiety could have just been a new manifestation of fear. Embarrassment could have just been a part of disgust. And Ennui? That's not really even an emotion. How about, I don't know, love?I felt like there was no direction at all.

Which yes, it's ok because you're making friends, and it's not at the same time because they could get really sad. Overall, the mid part made me really sad when anxiety started to worry about and moved really fast. It reminds me of school and how that makes me have a panic attack.

1022789,No summary,"The continuation of Inside Out (2015), Inside Out 2 (2024) follows Riley's story as she's becoming a teenager and discovering how to be one.The huge positive is that they introduce a lot of new things. First, Riley's new emotions: Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, Ennui, and Nostalgia. As Riley has entered a new phase in her life, the addition of those emotions makes sense. Not to mention they are so relatable to me, especially Anxiety and Embarrassment. Second, I love the new things like Riley's Sar Chasm (which is a good pun), Brain Storm, and Riley's Beliefs mechanism, they're so creative. I also love the new combination of 3D and 2D animation.What's also good is that they keep the previous but important element of the story, such as Joy having her moment when hugging Riley's memories. The new element that isn't in the previous movie is that there's a bit of heroic moments in the final act of the story, which is satisfying IMO.The negative that I'd like to share a bit is that there's this Riley's secrets that involve her childhood favourite cartoon and her favourite video game character that I wish we could explore more.But overall, this movie is just as good as the first one. The formula is similar, but lots of the new things carry it. Because I absolutely love Inside Out (2015), I'll give this one as much as the first one deserved, 9/10.",9.0,euvin,2024-06-15,1.0,4.0

1022789,No summary,"It can connect to you in some way, as Riley is trying to act cool around the cool kids. And as a teenager, she's moved on from her past life, the gigs, her old friends. She is always trying to move on, act cooler and make new friends. As a Teenager, I can say this side to the story is very relatable. And it's what works about this story. Some teenager can relate, and that's why it's great, and Riley is a well written character throughout the first and second film.Riley also plays sports, and I enjoy the sport she likes. She plays Hockey, and tries her best to get into the team. Which all people try and do, another relatable side to the story. And I love how relatable it was throughout. After the disappointment of not being ready, she tries harder, and as a result of that it hurts the people she loves the most, as she's overly fixated on becoming a champ at Hockey. And she tries her best to prepare herself.The added characters felt a bit gimmicky at times, but I more or less enjoyed the new Characters. Especially Embarrasment, I always laughed when he was on. And he was a great character, as well as Anxiety. Who was the main side character in the story, who tries to set up Rileys future and fails.I love how are old characters are split up from the new, it creates some tension and drama. Whilst building up some character development for are new Characters. Which works well for both old and new. And the set up with Riley as a teenager is brilliant throughout too, she has some great moments in Hockey and with anger and dismissive attitude towards her mother. And that is also very accurate amongst teenager behaviour.I had a double date and we all gave our verdict, so I'll share them with you, Me:8/10, My Girlfriend 10/10, Her best Friend 9/10, Her Boyfriend 9/10, so overall I would recommend this film, especially if your a teenager.",8.0,rohanumpleby-34057,2024-06-15,29.0,18.0

She's excelling in hockey, and she and her friends are selected to attend a hockey camp. However, she discovers her friends won't be going to her high school and meets some new girls who will. She begins experiencing new, strange emotions while navigating this transition and going through puberty. How will her old emotions handle the surge of new emotions to help Riley through this adjustment period?This film is directed by Kelsey Mann, in her directorial debut, and features the voices of Amy Poehler (Baby Mama), Maya Hawke (Stranger Things), Phyllis Smith (The Office), Lewis Black (Man of the Year), and Kensington Tallman (Drama Club).This is such a smart animated series with valuable lessons and real-life scenarios that resonate with everyone as they journey to adulthood. It cleverly illustrates how emotions evolve and how one's old and new selves adjust as responsibilities increase and life lessons are learned. The storyline is excellent. We saw this film in 3D, and the animation was stupendous. The hair and texture looked so realistic, you felt like you could reach out and touch them. There's so much to love in this animated gem.In conclusion, Inside Out 2 is another animated gem from Disney with smart coming-of-age elements that's worthwhile for the entire family.

1022789,No summary,"Inside Out 2 is another film in a long line of cash-grab sequels. It is full of saccharine, artificial emotions in an attempt to make grown-ups feel mature for watching a kiddy film. I watched this is a packed theatre of kids, and it was interesting how few laughs there were from kids. They clearly aren't the target audience anymore. Every punchline was predictable, as every character by their very nature is one dimensional.Ever since the reaction to the opening scene from Up, where audiences had a profound emotional reaction to the sad montage, Pixar has been chasing that high. No longer do they want to be relentlessly entertaining and funny, with a dash of drama. Now the drama comes first, their primary goal is to make adult audience members cry and hit ""in the feels"". Inside Out 2 serves the same purpose as the Zack Snyder DC films. It's much easier to pander to adults who feel like watching a safe, simple kids film is actually them watching provocative art, than it is to actually make something funny and original.In every Pixar film I've seen, even the mediocre ones like Toy Story 4, Luca and Incredibles 2, there has been amazing animation that has stunned me. Inside Out 2 is the first Pixar film that didn't have any impressive animation. Kung Fu Panda 4 had more interesting and impressive animation, and that film was notably worse in terms of animation than its predecessors. Also, KFP4 actually made kids laugh.In terms of both animation, storyline and dialogue, this felt like a straight-to-dvd flick. There was dialogue that so blatantly spelled out the themes of the movie, it reminded me of the Hunchback of Notre Dame 2. The whole flick is so repetitive, it's just the same thing over and over again. Riley does something, then her emotions react and press some buttons, Riley reacts to this, but it's not what the emotions intended, then the emotions press a bunch more buttons to fix it. Wash, rinse, repeat. It's such a bore. Sadness tries something, it doesn't work, so anger tries something, it doesn't work, then anxiety tries something that doesn't work.... Etc....They do the same joke with ""embarrassment"" about 6 times, sadness cries at the drop of the hat so much that it's clearly just a crutch for the writers who need a cheap laugh, and every scenario of conflict is forced and contrived.There's a scene where the coach tells the hockey team to put their phones in a box, and they all turn and get angry at Riley for it. But they're playing hockey, why would they need their phones at all? The coach had the box ready when she came in the room, this was clearly not Riley's fault. Then the coach makes them do fitness drills, and the girls get angry at Riley again, as if this film has been written solely by people who have never played any sports and think fitness drills are solely a punishment, and not the go-to standard for training?It's such lazy writing to get Riley from point A to point B. Speaking of which, the emotion characters jump on a parade float, and then with absolutely no capability to steer it, it just floats conveniently exactly to the place they need to go. Again, sloppy, straight-to-streaming level writing. This whole story is something you'd expect from a Saturday morning tv show. There's a character whose sole purpose is to be a deus ex Machina, and the way they resolve the scene is again, just pure dumb luck. It genuinely feels like a movie that was improvised as it went along.I did like the nostalgia gags and the videogame character, their design and animation was clever. If you're an adult who doesn't get your validation from kids films, this isn't for you. This isn't Up, Wall-E, Incredibles or even Soul, it's a by-the-numbers, low stakes sequel forced on Pixar by Disney. 20 years ago, Pixar told Disney they wouldn't do sequels, then they compromised and did a few, now it's literally just become a studio pumping out IP products with none of the originality and care of the studio in the 90's and 00's.",4.0,knoxfan2008,2024-06-15,12.0,14.0
1022789,No summary,"Pixar's much-anticipated follow-up to the mind-bending original, Inside Out 2, dives back into the chaotic headquarters of Riley's emotions, this time as she tackles the turbulent terrain of adolescence.The film tackles a relevant and relatable theme-the pressure to be perfect that plagues many teens. We see Anxiety slowly hijacking Riley's console, her need for control turning into a relentless pursuit of good grades, social status, and the approval of her impossibly cool classmate, Val. While the exploration of teenage anxiety is commendable, the plot itself feels a bit predictable. We've seen the ""overachieving teen"" trope before, and the resolution, while heartwarming, feels a touch formulaic.Where Inside Out 2 shines is in its visual storytelling. The animation is, as expected from Pixar, stunning. The introduction of new ""emotion landscapes,"" like the Sar-Chasm that fuels Riley's contemptuous side, and the jungle that represents her unconscious, are imaginative and visually dazzling. The use of colour is particularly effective, with Anxiety's world rendered in a sterile, monochromatic palette that beautifully reflects her controlling nature. The voice acting remains strong, with Poehler and Black perfectly capturing Joy and Anger's signature traits. Hawke, as the newcomer Anxiety, delivers a high-strung performance that's both comical and relatable.However, some of the new characters, like Ennui, feel a bit underdeveloped. Their personalities aren't fleshed out as fully as the originals, leaving them as one-note additions to the emotional spectrum. The film's pacing also falters at times, particularly in the second act, where the focus on Riley's anxieties starts to feel repetitive.Inside Out 2 is a film with good intentions. It tackles a complex issue with a fair amount of humour and heart. But it doesn't quite recapture the magic of the original. The predictable plot and underdeveloped new characters hold it back from greatness. Still, the beautiful animation, strong voice acting, and relatable themes make it a worthwhile watch, particularly for parents with teenagers navigating the emotional rollercoaster of adolescence.So, is it a must-see? Not necessarily. But it's a decent popcorn flick with a message about the importance of embracing all of our emotions, even the messy ones. And hey, that's something we can all agree on, right?",7.0,steveinadelaide,2024-06-15,3.0,5.0

1022789,No summary,"I saw it earlier tonight and I enjoyed the movie. Inside Out 2 is a success just like its predecessor. It should be spawned into a franchise, too. What I like about the movie is how the emotions operate in their own way in Riley's mind. I even liked it when they worked together in her mind. It's like they're going on an adventure. So, I say Inside Out 2 is the best Pixar movie you can ever ask for. It would also be a good idea for Disney and Pixar to make an Inside Out 3. If this approves, viewers like me can get to see what Riley and her emotions will do. I hope it will be exciting. Make number 3.",10.0,michaelbryant-57501,2024-06-15,1.0,7.0
1022789,No summary,"As a father of kids aging out of childhood the original Inside Out crushed me. It's a 10/10 movie for me. Inside Out 2 is a great sequel with its own emotional impact, but it wasn't as much for me as the original. I will bet my kids, and probably anyone dealing with their own emotions, may find that this movie hits pretty close to home. Even if it doesn't it's still a fun story with important insight. This is a top tier Pixar film, which is good news for anyone worried that Pixar has lost it.A good sequel is one that builds on the previous movie and IO2 does that well. The writers have expanded on the previous world and didn't undo anything just to make a story (too many sequels just hit the reset button).The returning cast, replacement cast, and new character cast are all amazing once again. Even though the voices of some characters are different you don't notice it at all. Maya Hawk has the biggest load to carry and she's excellent.

1022789,No summary,"Pixar has such a strong record with its output, with Inside Out being a particularly shiny jewel in that crown. However, aside from Toy Story 2 it's rare for one of their sequels to rival the original. Thankfully though I think Inside Out 2 does a great job of recapturing the magic and creating a worthy successor to Inside Out.We pick up the story with Riley as she approaches high school, which brings with it a whole new bunch of emotions. Enter Embarrassment, Ennui, Envy, and everyone's favourite Anxiety, as they shake up Riley's world and clash with returning emotions Anger, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Joy.Much like the first film, the story of this movie is really sweet, special and heartwarming. There is so much to take away for people of all ages about how to navigate our emotions, and how all of our experiences and feelings shape us. I don't think it is as much of a tearjerker as the first film, but it builds to an emotional climax that is really endearing and sweet.As always with Pixar films the imaginative elements are brilliant. The world inside Riley's head was so beautifully crafted in the first film, and this is extended in fantastic ways in this film. We explore new areas all of which are well designed and beautifully animated.The humour throughout the film is really solid. As you'd expect from a Pixar film there are jokes for all ages which will keep kids and adults entertained.In terms of the voice acting I was super impressed. A couple of changes in the main characters from the first film was a shame but the new actors performed well. Particularly impressive however was Maya Hawke who gives a terrific performance as Anxiety. Amy Poehler is of course fantastic.All of the above means that if you enjoyed Inside Out then you will love this follow up too. It captures all of the wonderful magic of the first film, and even though it doesn't quite have the emotional punch that the first film did, it still has a heartwarming and important message, great acting, and just brilliant vibes throughout!",8.0,ethanbresnett,2024-06-14,2.0,5.0
1022789,No summary,"As a huge fan of the first Inside Out, I was looking forward to this movie for a long time. I just watched Inside Out 2 today, and while there are plenty of great additions to this movie, it slightly lacks in comparison to its critically acclaimed predecessor.Starting off with the positive, as with all Pixar films, the animation and the soundtrack were amazing. The acting was great too. There were many funny scenes throughout the movie and there wasn't one boring scene in the film. I loved the inclusion of the new emotions and characters and they made for an interesting and welcoming plot twist.Now for the negative. I found that the pacing of this movie was way too fast, as with most movies geared towards kids. It almost seemed like the movie ended too soon. And so much more could've been explored. It felt like so much was missing.It would've been great if the characters of the new emotions were more thoroughly developed, as the movie primarily focuses on Anxiety. I was looking forward to seeing Nostalgia in the movie but she hardly makes an appearance at all. This could have opened up so many opportunities for the movie.Secondly, I found that the message of the story doesn't hit as hard as it did in the first movie. That strong emotional impact the first movie had is not felt nearly as intensely in this movie, and it feels watered down.In spite of this, the movie was still good, relatable, and it's definitely one of Pixar's better recent releases.",,heydude1215,2024-06-14,15.0,10.0

1022789,No summary,"This is one of the only movie sequels which I had a big expectations on, due to bunch of marketing and interesting new characters.This movie introduces a whole new theme compared to its predecessor which was about how all the emotions are important and also the synergy they can have, which is shown by Joy and Sadness forming a memory with mix of them. This movie focuses on developing a personality, that should be depended on every single one of your emotions, memories and experiences.When I first saw the part where Joy was throwing ""bad"" memories far away, I thought ""but isn't this kinda wrong, since our memories are what makes us ourselves, and we cannot just get rid of 'em"" and I was glad to see that it was brought up as kind of an issue.They also gave a perfect and pretty simple explanation, on what happens to your ""secondary"" emotions when you grow up.Overall this movie was one of the best animated sequels and shows I've seen in a while and I absolutely recommend watching it, especially with your family and friends.",9.0,alexgadukyanking,2024-06-14,6.0,11.0

But it seems to me that the cartoon is a little short or lacks action. The cartoon seems longer at the beginning than at the end. He could use an extra 20 minutes.

1022789,No summary,"Joy, sadness, anger, fear and disgust are back to shape Riley's personality. Riley is the top of her class and is successful in ice hockey. She is a good friend to Grace and Bree as the trio impress the senior coach, all 3 get invited to the summer camp. Joy is happy to take control by separating the bad memories and shapes Riley's sense of self with just her good memories. On the night before the camp, Joy and co are woken up by puberty alarm and thus, their console gets taken over by new set of emotions - anxiety, envy, embarrassment and ennui. With anxiety all set to take over Joy's role, what happens to Riley at the camp and how does the original team save the day, forms rest of the story.A sequel to a beloved film, definitely has a big challenge to match the original. Though it does fall short in comparison, Inside Out 2 is still genuinely good. The story is fairly taken forward by sticking to the template and it is basically Joy vs Anxiety, with both trying to do the best for Riley in their own ways. But the strenght of this script lies in how well all the emotions get their fair share except ennui, as I wanted a bit more of her. The newer set of emotions introduced aren't as effective as the original five but then the magic of the first film is such, recreating it was never going to be an easy task. Despite that, the individual scenes featuring the new set of emotions do work. There were brief moments that did drag but there is plenty of humor laced emotional narrative that commands a watch because Riley is worth it and acknowledging her emotions, even more.",7.0,chand-suhas,2024-06-14,1.0,3.0

Except where the first Inside Out was filled with 'magic' and 'wonder', this one is replaced with lacklustre moments and uninspired inserts. The train of thought becomes the stream of consciousness. The core memories are now core beliefs. And where in the first film, Riley must grapple with her entire known world collapsing beneath her - she now must grapple with going to a new high school without her middle school friends.The movie isn't exactly bad, but it feels cheaper in comparison. Even the lessons learned are important in this movie. Don't let anxiety control your brain.But isn't that what we learned from the first film? We saw Joy trying to be a control freak - and - what do you know - in this film, Anxiety turns into a control freak, causing a bunch of chaos for Riley.What's more, the new emotions seemed like lesser versions of the original emotions. Fear becomes Anxiety. Disgust becomes Envy. Sadness becomes Embarrassment and Ennui.It's just too bad that the first movie came out of seemingly nowhere and told a unique and loveable story with lessons for all ages, and in its sequel, we have a movie that feels half-baked and lacks as many whimsical/playful ideas as the first.The movie wasn't as fun or meaningful as the first.

The hockey plot is a marvelous analogy for what is going on in the life of this 13-year old; a striving to be her best self, and the confusion caused by the myriad metrics by which she can judge herself: school; social standing; athletics, parental love; friendships; even cultural artifacts like music and tv shows influence Riley's sense of self-worth, and as dramatized so well in ""Inside Out 2"", insight is hard won and well-earned.The sequel is itself a metaphor for Riley's struggle: ""Inside Out 2"" is competing against the original ""Inside Out"", and appropriately, every viewer will...well, no spoilers here, but the sequel deliberately leaves to the viewer the result of Riley's efforts.I've waited nine years for ""Inside Out 2"".

Maybe the writers wrote it during Covid and thought it was a great idea but they forget that Joy is the star provided there is something positive in the story for the audience and we would rather stay home if it's a downer negative story - esp with prices of movies these days.Only 3 stars for the animation but it's pointless if story is not good.,3.0,filmtravel101,2024-06-14,28.0,91.0

I will say, for the most part, I was wrong.While the film does share a familiar structure of the first Inside Out this sequel in thanks to the new emotions, and new lessons for Riley and the emotions to learn, along with new jokes that can be made of Riley's teenage hood make it new enough.I appreciated the new emotions and how they would go on to grow Riley and also, in turn, continually humble Joy as well as the emotions learning they are all important to the maturing of this young girl.One of my favorite new aspects of this film which I did not see coming was introducing Rileys ""beliefs"" they did what I found to be a very intriguing visual representation of what I inferred to be Rileys soul but it could be also be inferred to be her subconscious either way it was well done.Inside Out 2 was far better than I had anticipated, and it was filled with laughs and feel good that Pixar knows how to deliver. I don't know if Pixar would do a third, but with how much I enjoyed this film, I would not say no.IMDb: 7/10

1022789,No summary,"A decade ago I saw the first film, and it was a critically acclaimed hit and industry acclaimed, won the Oscar for best animated feature.But to make a sequel that has elements to Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken, it was a bad move, the animation is almost going to the uncanny valley, story of teenage life is taken from Ruby Gillman's playbook, the folks from Emeryville are watching what Kirk & Faryn are doing for Ruby, and the folks responsed by having one of their own acclaim hits with a sequel.I only praised the voice cast performance, they did a terrific job on the film, with one new character played by the daughter of Ethan Hawke is surprising.But for most, they are stealing so many stuff that Ruby Gillman have achieved, with high school drama, fantasy elements, experimental score, and a teenager as a lead was definitely a knockoff.I had a very distrust in franchises and sequels because it will lose it luster with its audience, and very supported of films with original ideas. This film is definitely the one I will not to go see.I gave this movie a thumbs down, and a 1/10 score.",1.0,craigmills-02167,2024-06-14,28.0,176.0

I know I'm not a certified critic, but for me there is something about Disney, ESPECIALLY Pixar. This movie evoked all of my emotions (Pixar tends to do that), but in such a clever and relatable way. Ever since the first Inside Out, I fell in love with this movie franchise and was so happy when they announced the second one... this one did not disappoint. It was in all honesty just slightly better than the first one, and I'm trying to wrap my head around how. This one is slightly better to me because of anxiety, envy, embarrassment, and ennui being added to the team and being of importance to the storyline. I don't want to give any spoilers, but all I will say is - anxiety and joy have to find a way to work together and being someone with severe anxiety this REALLY hit home.",10.0,Gleek4eva,2024-06-14,18.0,20.0
1022789,No summary,"The teenage mind has a lot of emotion, which we explore in Inside Out 2! From taking rides down your river of consciousness to discovering your deep dark secrets. Inside Out 2 makes you think and discover a bit of yourself.Inside Out 2 is a time skip to the first establishment. It continues to follow Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Tony Hale), Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Liza Lapria), who are Riley's (Kensington Tallman) original emotions. Now introducing her ""Teenage years"" new emotions are introduced such as Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Ennui (Adèle Exarchopoulos), Envy (Ayo Edebiri) and Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser). When Riley gets accepted to Hockey Camp, Anxiety and new emotions try to take over her core beliefs. It's up to Joy and her group to find a way to get Riley back to the way she was.This film is much deeper compared to the first film. This explores the concept of growing up and the more complex emotions that can ""take over"" other feelings. Anxiety, as the villain, is genius in the sense that most people see it that way. Anxiety tends to overpower joy as metaphorically shown in this film. My favorite aspect of Inside Out 2 is the little hints of the mind they added. I love that they now have beliefs that create the ""self,"" the river of consciousness which changes floating items based on your thoughts and, even the vault of secrets. This film runs 1 hour and 36 minutes and is worth the watch for new and prior fans!The film's message is to be true to yourself and, while you should prepare for the future, don't let that stop you from experiencing the present. In the film, Anxiety works on always preparing Riley for the future which means her destroying who Riley is and should be. Riley begins to ""suffer the consequences"" of that action which takes a toll on her. While there is nothing to look out for in Inside Out 2, it is a much deeper-minded film so it can get viewers thinking deeper or experiencing certain emotions.Inside Out 2 gets 5 out of 5 stars from me and I recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

1022789,No summary,"Inside Out 2 talks about ""growing up"" in an emotional way and depicts how growing up is challenging inside our thoughts. The film introduces the emotions we had from the previous movie: Joy, Anger, Sadness, Fear and Disgust. We are also introduced to new emotions: embarrassment, Ennui (boredom), Envy and Anxiety.Riley is about to go to high school but the story focuses on her preparation to officially join the FogHorn Hockey team. As the story progresses, Riley finds herself challenged with her hopes to join the team. Her friendship was wounded, her emotions went all over the place and the pressure got into her head. But eventually, everything goes into their proper places.This sequel film may be animated and made for kids but as an adult, it just hits differently. I can say that this film was partially made for adults and for anyone who is in a bad mental situation. It reminds its viewers how growing older can be tough, how overthinking affects everything else, how decisions that are made today may affect what's next. But it is also a strong reminder that problems, fear, worries and anxieties will come. They are all inevitable but everything will pass. Take a deep breath, stay calm and do not overstress everything. Having a calm mind also affects the way we think. We may feel pressure at any given time but we have to sit back and relax.Do not overstress things at the present. Live at the moment. The future is there but we live at the present, right here, right now. Enjoy life. Remember that you are not alone on whatever you are facing. Keep your friends and family close. And finally, God is always with us.Inside Out 2 is a great film. Every audience will have a different way of enjoying this but just remember, you are who you are.

1022789,No summary,"""Inside Out 2"" is the sequel to Pixar's 2015 film ""Inside Out"". Directed and co-written by Kelsey Mann and featuring the voices of Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, Tony Hale, Liza Lapira, and Maya Hawke, it is a worthy follow-up that might just be the best Pixar sequel that is not related to the ""Toy Story"" series.One year after the events of the first film, Riley Andersen (voiced by Kensington Tallman) has just turned 13 and is ready to start high school. Once again guiding Riley on her journey are her emotions Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler), Sadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith), Anger (voiced by Lewis Black), Fear (voiced by Tony Hale), and Disgust (voiced by Liza Lapira). When Riley ventures off to ice hockey camp with her best friends, her five emotions try to work together to ensure she is able to make a good first impression by removing her negative memories and sending them to the back of her mind. To her shock, Riley soon learns that her friends will be attending different high schools and her emotions are unable to help her react to this in the usual clear manner. Complicating matters further, Riley also gains four new emotions in the process - Anxiety (voiced by Maya Hawke), Envy (voiced by Ayo Edebiri), Embarrassment (voiced by Paul Walter Hauser), and Ennui (voiced by Adele Exarchopoulos).Back in 2015, Pixar released what myself and many others consider to be one of their very best films - ""Inside Out"". This landmark movie, which focuses on the personified emotions of a young girl named Riley, successfully appealed to viewers from all walks of life thanks to the clever way it tackles deep and important themes that virtually anyone can relate to regardless of their age. As a result, the film has deservedly cemented itself among not only Pixar's crowning achievements but also as quite possibly one of the greatest animated films of all time. Unlike many other Pixar films, I've always thought that this one had the most amount of sequel potential due to the character of Riley growing older and her emotions needing to assist her with even more of life's problems. Nine years later, we now have ""Inside Out 2"", a follow-up that covers the complexity of early adolescence and the obstacles we are all bound to face along the way.As to be expected, this film does away with Riley's naive, child-like view of the world in favour of her adopting a more mature outlook as a teenager. We see how her five emotions, led by the perpetually optimistic Joy, have learned to work in harmony with each other to ensure that Riley has the most enjoyable experience possible in this new period of her life. While things seem to be fine for everyone at first, certain situations start to arise that cause many issues for the five emotions, such as how the quintet are unable to decipher the sarcastic facial expressions of Riley's friends. In an effort to correct issues like this, Joy has all negative memories like this launched into the back of Riley's mind as a form of suppression, which seems to work until one night. This is when the emotions notice a large alarm labelled ""Puberty"" flashing brightly, and despite their best efforts to rid themselves of this warning signal, they soon realise that things can only worse from here on out.We are then introduced to four brand new emotions who suddenly show up out of the blue. Anxiety, who nervously tries to control any situation, Envy, who covets everyone's best features, Embarrassment, who regularly makes a fool of himself, and Ennui, an apathetic emotion who would rather stare at her phone than interact with others. Though these new additions to Riley's emotional state are welcomed by the other five, it becomes clear that this place has little room for so many emotions working at the same time. Believing the original five are now no longer needed, Anxiety has them placed inside a glass bottle and stored away to allow her to take control of Riley's new teenage mindset. With this new power at her fingertips, Anxiety starts to create negative memories out of nothing, which causes havoc on Riley's self esteem. What we see here is the emergence of something most teenagers can relate to - a paranoid, distorted world view that changes the way they see themselves. In poor Riley's case, she starts viewing herself as an outcast loser.The film does a solid job showing all of the resulting awkwardness that Riley faces with her new emotions at the helm. She constantly assumes the worst in everything, she craves becoming a great hockey player like her heroes, she clumsily tries to look cool in front of others, and she cannot find the motivation to overcome her problems in a constructive manner. Without her original five emotions around to help her, Riley loses sight of who she truly is, becoming an insecure shell of her former self. For the majority of the story, we watch as Joy and the other four original emotions journey back to headquarters to stop their successors from corrupting Riley further, finding creative ways to sneak their influence in to fix any damage they have caused. Like the previous film, this one cleverly uses Riley's emotional state to show us how we all must find the right methods to cope with the obstacles we face in life to grow into a better person.In addition to this, the film also looks as fantastic as ever, something that should go without saying in a Pixar movie. In one scene, we see a dark and mysterious location known as the ""Sense of Self"", where all of Riley's core memories are stored through string-like strands that play quotes that resonate through Riley's mind to remind her of the type of person she is at heart. When Anxiety takes over, she corrupts some of these memories in the form of a small tree, which grows larger as Riley makes more mistakes over time. It's interesting to see how each of these places change once the new emotions have seized control, and the film gives us glimpses of what they were once like with the original five in charge.All of these new emotions means more characters than before, which is unfortunately one of the film's most obvious weaknesses. With a total of nine emotions now inside Riley's head, it feels like the film is struggling to juggle so many different characters within the story at the same time but only managing to pull it off sparingly. The only new emotion that is given the most spotlight is Anxiety, and although this makes sense within the context of the story, it does not allow for the other three to be featured nearly as enough. I was hoping to see more of the dynamic between Anxiety and her other three compadres, yet this only really happens at about two crucial moments in the film. Still, there was one scene near the end that utilises everyone reasonably well, even if it did take a long time to reach that point in the story.The film's voice acting is a strong as ever, with Amy Poehler injecting that much needed positive relief into Joy. Like Riley, Joy appears to have grown considerably since the previous film, changing from a blind optimist to a sensible pragmatist. She now understands the value of teamwork, often seeking advice from her fellow emotions whenever she can't figure out how to make Riley react in certain situations. As a result, this film feels more like a team effort rather than a solo adventure, with Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust contributing significantly to both Joy and Riley's growth as characters. I really liked watching the way Poehler portrays Joy's collaborative personality throughout the film, and her respective chemistry with Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, Tony Hale, and Liza Lapira really gives the impression that these emotions are a tight-knit group.As mentioned earlier, it is Anxiety that the film chooses to focus on the most out of the four new emotions. Maya Hawke is great at showing the character's intense neuroticism coupled with her desire to maintain her own twisted sense of control over Riley's life. She can be considered the antithesis to Joy's level-headed, confident nature, projecting all of her insecurities into Riley's personality. I just wish Anxiety interacted more with Envy, Embarrassment, and Ennui, whose voice talents in Ayo Edebiri, Paul Walter Hauser, and Adele Exarchopoulos felt somewhat wasted by the time the film had finished.For a sequel to a highly regarded original, ""Inside Out 2"" may not quite live up to the level of its predecessor, but it is nonetheless a satisfying continuation of a story about someone's emotional journey through life. Without revealing spoilers, its end moral is equally as impactful as the original and is sure to strike a chord with just as many adults as it will with children. It seems the next logical step that a third film should cover Riley and her emotions during her late teens to early adult years, although this may prove challenging to remain family friendly. Regardless, I'm still curious to see what happens from here.I rate it 8/10.",8.0,MrDHWong,2024-06-13,11.0,12.0
1022789,No summary,"""Inside Out 2"" is a decent charming continuation about emotions, feelings, identities, and a tale of a coming-of-age of Riley Andersen. Firstly, for this sequel, I appreciate Pixar exploring new concepts about teenage stages for youth, new approaches to the characters and providing some good genuine emotional developments within the narrative. The character of Riley Andersen entering her teenage stage and having it shown from the perspectives of her emotion characters does have some good depth alongside with good animation, colors, and voice performances from the cast members. Allowing some solid chemistry between the characters and dialogue.Personally, what causes the movie to struggle is it's emotional connection and dynamics at times, loses the same spark from it's previous movie. Sure, its original characters, humor, and colorful animation remains powerful and holding to its heights, however, because of some of the new characters I didn't connect with and certain concepts feeling thin, the strong emotional connection and atmospheres feel lost as if it floats around the mind aimlessly.Nevertheless, it does feel a relief where Disney actually puts some effort into making a solid movie after years of disappointments and disappointments.",6.0,chenp-54708,2024-06-13,36.0,53.0

1022789,No summary,"Watched Inside Out 2 today!For the parents out there: Please do explain the concept of the movie BEFORE going into it with your kid. Though I get emotions are difficult & complex to understand, even for adults (as shown perfectly by Inside Out 1&2), I guess no harm will come from saying something to them before watching the movie. My seatmates came with their kid (est. Age 5-8) and the parent had such a difficult time explaining the complexities of different emotions DURING THE MOVIE. Kids are confused and WILL ask questions, guide them to see what the message of this movie is trying to say. It will help them to understand their emotions as they grow up. Make the experience more meaningful. Anyways, just keep in mind of cinema etiquette I guess...But with that, I LOVED this movie. I have never been so validated and seen in my life. In the media today, we all see how anxiety is portrayed but never how it really is. This movie just explained why I am the way I am, and maybe even how to live life even when things get overwhelming and complicated. If anything, ALL of our emotions are important. There's this one line by Joy that is so perfectly said. It struck out to me so much since my dad died when I was 19. Just before ""adulthood"", just before anything really. So I shut everything out. My last year of being a teenager came to waste because of the daily breakdowns. I forgot how to live. I forgot how to be happy. I became so numb to the point that everything became black & white. I was on auto-pilot and I didn't even notice it until everything came crashing down.This movie has highlighted what I have been going through for the past year and showing how wrong it was to shut the grief out. Emotions are meant to be felt. Life is overwhelming BUT Life is meant to be lived.There's this one cartoon-ish character that really brought me flashbacks as a 2000s kid. HAHAH kudos to the person who thought of that. Then again, I wish they(😉) had more depth to them (in a way).Overall, I think this movie is perfect for everyone, though I think this movie is best for pre-teens, teens, & adults.",10.0,uemail-44080,2024-06-12,93.0,46.0

Even if Pixar doesn't even try to top the first Inside Out, this sequel, Inside Out 2 as its own was still a lackluster in my opinion unfortunately, now it wasn't a bad film at all, i didn't hate it, i didn't dislike it, it just that in my opinion Inside Out 2 felt less important than the first one, felt less deeper than the first one, in the first movie Riley was still in her pre-teenage years and yet somehow the theme feeling and story and the emotion of that movie felt more adults, that's what missing here or at least what i wish for, the more grown up story for Riley, sure it still makes sense that after what happen in the first movie everything was better for Riley, and this high school era of Riley was still acceptable and realistic enough, and so while i do hope more serious story, i'm still completely fine with it, then comes the new emotion, Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, and Boredom, and to make it less longer, i thought they all an ok enough new addition to the film overall, but i do thought that Anxiety could be too much for me or over the top at times and so that also quite became a miss from me, i do felt a bit bored at times, and that's about it for the things i don't really dig it in this sequel, quite a lot, but i do still have some soft spot for the film, the things that i like are of course the voice acting are mostly good, the animation was great, i do still enjoy a portion of the stuff that happening in the film, there is this three new characters in the film that they didn't show in any of the trailer and god did i wish they did more in the film, i can see them also join Joy and the gang for the rest of the film and it will makes the film way better, too bad they have so little of screentime as i really thought they were the best things in the film, overall i found Inside Out 2 as not a bad sequel but more of like a less special and less important sequel, not a good one too but there is still something to like, it's a movie that try to be less serious than the previous one while still added some seriousness in it but it just wasn't the same and wasn't as powerful as the previous one, but still an ok depiction of someone that was in they early teenage stage, and so go watch it if you like the first one, if you don't then go still watch it i guess, if you really love the first one then i suggest reduce your expectations a bit before you watch it.",6.0,HabibieHakim123,2024-06-12,18.0,41.0

The yellow henchmen's slapstick gags & antics remain hilarious but that isn't enough to sustain the main plot which is bland, generic & full of narrative shortcomings. In short, yet another disposable offering from Illumination.",,CinemaClown,2024-11-15,1.0,0.0
519182,No summary,"Probably one of the best modern examples of a ""nothing movie"". You essentially just watch those old Minion shorts that came with your blu-ray copies of Despicable Me for an hour and a half. The amount of disconnected plotlines and random nonsense scenes that don't go anywhere make for an atrocious hodge podge flimble of a film.Gru isn't even himself, he's scared of everyone and everything, I guess one of the girls is going through highschool despite the fact that none of them have visibly aged. The villain is this randomly introduced Dr. Cockroach who's motivation stems from a petty highschool grudge and an arrest, two things that Gru, the man who stole the moon, cares way too much about.The ""mega minions"" storyline is entertaining but just like the remaining bits of the movie, its pointless and doesn't go anywhere, the scenes exist to waste your time. What this movie feels like are a bunch of plots from a cancelled Despicable Me tv series that got shoved into a piston press and made into this goober movie. I felt absolutely no tension for the entire movie, and pretty much every joke fell flat. 1 Nefar is barely present except for 3 lines at the end of the movie.The film is just the definition of pointless. You watch them go around and do nothing, just like in 'Secrets of Dumbledore', for the sake of doing nothing. Gru plays tennis, Gru drives them to school, Lucy goes shopping, Lucy does peoples hair, Margo talks about a glitter bomb, Agnes and Edith go to karate class. And none of these go anywhere. All just disconnected scenes played for jokes.Every time they hint at building up something that even slightly matters, such as Agnes's moral dilemma with lying, it just doesn't go anywhere. They touch on it twice and theres no resolution. Why does the random goat from the 3rd movie have a more emotional reuniting scene than Gru with his own son?Even the worldbuilding, as shabby as it already is, is somewhat destroyed in this movie. Gru is just working for the AVL again despite being fired in the last movie, Silas is the head of the AVL again, despite retiring in the last movie. The AVL is no longer this secret organization for taking down villains, it just has this megastructure in the middle of a city with a giant official logo plastered on the side of it. Why is there a supervillain hogwarts? Is this Harry Potter? None of this makes sense, what is the purpose of a supervillain school?Bad smelly movie, but this one made 980 million dollars so I hope you guys get what you want with the next 5 of these.",2.0,EatThatPie,2024-11-15,1.0,1.0

If you count the Minions movies, this is the 6th installment of the Despicable Me franchise and this time, the entire family must defeat their newest foe in Gru's old classmate Maxime who is obsessed with exacting revenge on Gru for getting him thrown in jail during their school reunion.Similar to the previous movies in this franchise, Despicable Me 4 is a lot of laughs and a ton of fun for all ages. I have enjoyed every single one of these movies and this was no exception. Although I enjoyed this movie, I will admit that it is probably the weakest in the franchise. There is nothing particularly wrong with this movie, but it felt like it followed the same formula that the previous movies have and after a while it starts to get a little stale. Will Ferrell did a good job as the main villain and Joey King's character should definitely be brought back as a new core member of the team should they decide to continue the franchise. I especially enjoyed the easter eggs and call backs to the earlier films that popped up during the movie, including a scene towards the end of the film that I particularly enjoyed.Overall, I enjoyed this film, but did not love it and I would rank this as the worst Despicable Me film out of the 6 (including the Minions movies).

Gru has been notified an old adversary, who he beat in a villain of the year pageant years before, is out looking for revenge after breaking out of prison. Fearing for the safety of his family, Gru's minders put him & the fam into a witness relocation program where they try to fit in a new environment & where a pesky neighbor recognizes Gru & blackmails him to train her in the ways of villainy. The Minions also get a reboot w/the intro of super minions (reminiscent of the Fantastic Four) to aid in the new threat which seems to be targeting Gru's new baby boy who also doesn't care for daddy at this stage in his young life. And on & on it goes w/plot strands almost cancelling each other out for the sake of the usual Minion sight gags & intricate set pieces which don't add up to much but a chuckle & a wince by the time the last song montage runs into the end credit roll which considering the nearly billion dollars the film has taken in at the box office makes me think the filmmakers will not take a lick of my criticism to heart.",6.0,masonfisk,2024-10-31,3.0,0.0

519182,No summary,"Despicable Me 4 is once again an attempt by Illumation to expand the very popular franchise created in 2010, and which now contains 4 mainline movies and 2 spinoffs. However, did the new movie really expand on the franchise, and was it any good. And in my opinion, it did not. When we look back at what really defined the despicable me franchise, we can think of many aspects such as, unique characters with an interesting personality, a relatively simple plot that keeps us entertained, a good villain, and of course, minions. However, when comparing all of these aspects to the franchises newest release, we notice that almost none of them apply to it.When compared to the earlier movies, the characters in Despicable Me 4 fall really behind in terms of their development, and how interesting they are. Main characters such as Gru, Agnes, Edith, Margo and Lucy feel heavily underused throughout the plot, with them making no contributions to the main story whatsoever. Not only that, but the characters themselves feel simply uninteresting and sometimes even annoying. New characters, however, also suffer from the same problem, with characters such as the main villain, Maxime Lamal, having an uninteresting premise, with no motivations, and overall, just a dispensable character despite being ""the main villain"".Another major flaw of this movie, is its plot, or should I say plots. Unlike previous movies, Despicable Me 4 does not follow a traditional linear narrative, where we follow the story of a single character or group, instead, this movie feels more like a bunch of short movies put together, which have no implication on each other, and feel insignificant and messy overall. This in my opinion, is this movie's greatest flaw, since it really undermines the use of characters, introduce unnecessary plots that add nothing to the main story, if there even is one, and make the story confusing. Just to give an idea of how many plots there are, I could count 5 just of the top of my head, those being almost entirely dedicated to Gru, Lucy, The girls (Agnes, Edith and Margo), Maxime Lamal and the Minions. This makes it not only very hard to follow the story, but also makes the movie seem like it doesn't know how to develop its plot.Despicable Me 4 once again feels like an easy cash grab by Illumination, with uninspired characters, inconsistent sub-plots which add nothing to the main story, and with a humor that feels ""cheap"" and unfunny. Of course, there may be some fun to be found for some people, especially younger audiences, but in my opinion this movie just feels like a wasted hour and a half of my life.",5.0,joaoum,2024-10-09,0.0,0.0
519182,No summary,"Ah, ""Despicable Me 4."" As a parent, I find myself navigating the thrilling world of animated films, and let me tell you, it's often a rollercoaster of emotions-mostly centered around whether I can stay awake through the whole thing. To be completely honest, my enthusiasm for this particular installment was about as high as a minion's IQ, which is to say, not very high at all. I went into the movie with the expectation that it would be just another excuse to keep the kids entertained while I secretly wished for an uninterrupted nap.So, there I was, plopped on the couch with my children, ready for an hour and a half of animated antics. I mean, who wouldn't want to spend their evening watching cartoon villains? It's like the cinematic equivalent of a kid's birthday party: loud, chaotic, and somehow exhausting. As the opening credits rolled, I tried to muster some enthusiasm, reminding myself that this is what parenting is all about. You know, sacrificing your own interests for the sake of the little ones. That noble cause took a nosedive when the minions popped up on screen with their usual nonsensical chatter.I made it all the way to the mansion scene before my eyelids began to droop. This mansion was a sight to behold-a fantastical abode filled with hidden treasures, secret passages, and, of course, minion shenanigans. It was the kind of place I could easily see myself napping in, preferably on a luxurious couch with a fluffy blanket. I fought valiantly to stay awake, but you see, parenting has a way of draining you, and the allure of a comfortable couch is hard to resist. And just like that, I was out like a light.Now, I have to say, my kids really got into it. They were laughing, gasping, and shouting at the screen while I was happily snoozing away. I dreamt of peaceful landscapes-maybe a beach somewhere with a refreshing drink in hand-while the minions were wreaking havoc in their cartoonish ways. Fast forward to the climactic moment of the film, where I jolted awake right at the ending scene. There I was, hair a mess, drool on my shirt, and utterly confused as to what had transpired in the last hour.My kids, however, were buzzing with excitement, animatedly telling me about the hilarious hijinks they'd just witnessed. Apparently, Gru and his gang of misfits had been on some epic adventure that involved villainy, heroism, and more minions than you could shake a stick at. I must admit, as they recounted the story with all the energy of a sugar rush, I could see the charm of the film, even if I had missed the majority of it.Despite my less-than-stellar viewing experience, I'd rate ""Despicable Me 4"" an 8 out of 10. Why? Because it clearly achieved its goal of keeping the kids entertained, which is, let's face it, the ultimate benchmark for any family film. And let's not forget the bonus of my unexpected nap! While I wish it had lasted longer (the nap, not the movie), I can appreciate the moments when I managed to doze off while the kids reveled in animated chaos.In conclusion, if you're a parent contemplating whether to sit through ""Despicable Me 4,"" I'd say go for it. Bring a cozy blanket, maybe a pillow, and prepare for the occasional snooze. You might miss some of the story, but rest assured, your kids will fill you in on every detail afterward-usually while you're trying to enjoy a peaceful moment of silence. After all, this is the true essence of family movie nights: laughter, chaos, and a glorious excuse to catch up on some much-needed rest. So grab the popcorn, brace for the minions, and let the adventure (and your catnap) begin!.",5.0,spanky654,2024-10-08,0.0,0.0

519182,No summary,"When it comes to the Despicable Me franchise, Despicable Me (2010) and Despicable Me 2 (2013) were both great animated films, Despicable Me 3 (2017) was a good enough sequel, the first prequel film Minions (2015) was average, and the Minions sequel Minions: The Rise of Gru (2022) was pretty good; I was not expecting there to be a fourth installment, I did not know that much about the plot going in, and despite this being Illumination's most popular franchise, I was wondering why there was a need for a fourth film. The fourth installment Despicable Me 4 (2024) was ok because the film has well-done voice acting, great animation, a plot that is unfocused, entertaining moments with the Minions, fun action scenes, an entertaining enough main villain, and quite a few side plots; because I did not know much about the premise of the film going in I was a bit surprised by certain random and weird moments that would occur even if they do not make that much a difference to what its main focus is.I still like Steve Carell as Gru, and it goes between being funny and a little cringey when he is trying to be undercover with a fake identity, but there is also his new son Gru Jr. Who does not like him for some reason not explained, and a villain from the past wanting to get his revenge on him because of a certain event that happened; I also still like Kristen Wiig as Lucy, but she does not do much in the film except for being shown adapting to her fake identity and taking care of Margo, Edith, Agnes, and Gru Jr., along with the three girls having an occasional funny moment despite not being in the film that much. There is this girl named Poppy Prescott, voiced well by Joey King, who is the daughter of the neighbors next door to Gru's family safe house, and I thought she was a weird character; she is introduced quickly with her making her and Gru to do a heist, and later have her and him be friends somehow in a rushed way making her scenes feel unnecessary at times. Lastly, the Minions working at the AVL were entertaining to watch and seeing these five Minions turn into Mega Minions was entertaining enough to watch, despite their side plot having little to do with what the main characters are doing; also, what I noticed was an occasional superhero movie reference with the Mega Minions failing at saving people.The main villain is Maxime Le Mal who is voiced well by Will Ferrell who is having some fun in the role, because this character was weird and occasionally had a funny scene, and the reason for why he wants his revenge on Gru is stupid but funny along with him having an obsession with cockroaches that leads to future events in the film; also, there is Maxime's girlfriend Valentina voiced well by Sofia Vergara, who does not do much in the film but have an occasional funny line. Though the action scenes are fun to watch, and the animation is excellent, the film felt all over the place with it cutting back and forth between multiple side plots involving Gru and his family being undercover, the Mega Minions, Maxime wanting his revenge, Gru Jr. Being nicer to his father Gru, Lucy and the girls fitting in at their school and job, and Poppy wanting to be a villain by pulling off a heist with Gru; the comedy did not always work, with it either being a bit awkward or cringe worthy, but there are quite a bit of entertaining and fun moments along with quite a bit of effective funny moments and weird moments that surprised me.The fourth installment Despicable Me 4 (2024) was ok because the film has well-done voice acting, great animation, a plot that is unfocused, entertaining moments with the Minions, fun action scenes, and an entertaining enough main villain; because I did not know much about the premise of the film going in I was a bit surprised by certain random and weird moments along with the multiple side plots the film has. This installment is not terrible, and it is not excellent, it is a fine addition to the franchise that I thought was entertaining and fun enough to watch, leading to a fine conclusion; I highly suggest that the Despicable Me films should end here because this fourth film made me think they were running out of ideas for them, so I will say you should at least watch this once, and I recommend giving the last three films if you have not already.",6.0,MB-reviewer185,2024-08-10,3.0,0.0

Despicable ME 4 worstThis movie is garbage and waste of time. Highly recommended don't watch it. I think movie maker forget to add story line.(Spoilers)
This movie sucked. I went in with high hopes and left feeling disappointed. The main reasons this movie was god awful are:1. The plot makes ZERO sense. Things are just thrown in and happen without any rhyme or reason. An example is the whole scene with Lucy in the hair salon and the lady being burned. It's never mentioned ever again afterwards. The karate scene as well. The thing with the neighbors and tennis also feels out of place. Poppy gets Gru to steal the honey badger and wants him to return to a life of crime. But why does he even agree to go with her? They just met and she's a child. Makes no sense.2. The main villain (Maxime) felt very underdeveloped. The concept was actually really cool, and I loved his character design. But he feels lame. He wants to kidnap Gru's baby, but for what? Revenge for a freshman year talent show? The motive is weak and barely mentioned at best. The scenes we get are cool, but there's no substance to them.3. The dialouge was sometimes hard to listen to. Gru didn't feel like Gru. He felt toned down and afraid of everything. It made me cringe in my seat. When he would talk to his son I wanted to shoot my brains out.Also the girls were just there?? They felt so out of place, and the only interesting thing we got from them was Margo's new school but that was mentioned one time.Overall the movie was pretty bad. Would not watch it again. If you have a lobotomized 5 year old they might like it because it's made for someone with the smallest attention span. Everything happens so quick and it feels rushed. The ending was cool but Vector had to do the floss and ruin it. The only acceptable scene was when the super minion was in the casino. Because you never lose in gambling.

519182,No summary,The movie was bad. I disliked it a lot because of the whole reason of why this is happening and what is happening is so stupid and gross. And if you hate the minions. The mega minions are so stupid and annoying. I know they were like the mascot of the movie but like who cares. I swear if they actually make a mega minions movie or a show I'm gonna be annoyed as hell! Last week I watched inside out 2 with Cyrus and at the end I asked if he would have rather to watch despicable me 4 and Nash from weirdy wanted to watch with me same with strifa from Thebutterflystrifa. I'm glad they didn't have to suffer with me.But positives. The new pharrel Williams song for this movie double life was good. At the end a minion practically swears.

519182,No summary,"The fourth entry of Despicable Me, not including the other minion spinoffs, sticks with what it knows and takes little risk in staying on script and not taking any risks. As usual, the minions are pretty cute with some clever laughable jokes regardless of the viewers age. Agnes is also so sweet that her scenes always help hold the movie together. As for the plot here it is pretty sub standard. The villain, Maxime Le Mal , is just ok and you re just supposed to accept his obsession with cockroaches. Instead of interesting or funny at times it can just feel a tad odd.Overall the minions by themselves will make it worth the watch for fans of the franchise, but you've got to wonder how many times they can keep going to the well here and keep people coming.",6.0,ThereelscoopwithKK,2024-09-16,0.0,0.0

519182,No summary,"No expectation what so ever. None! Gru and the gang are going for another adventure against evil forces and it doesn't really matter who it is, you probably won't get anything new, plot wise. There's a baby and Gru is already working with the forces of the intelligence (or something like this) and he should protect his family.Oh...yes...there are some minions and they get super enhanced for this one. And there are several more that accompany Gru's steps. Besides all of those, you should get your hopes up. You are not going to find any sophistication except a movie with slapstick jokes and targeted audience - young kids.My older kids laughed, my youngest enjoyed and laughed a lot and I was pretty entertained also. That's what you get when you set the bar so low. The minions are a brand and this one should be cultivated and squeezed until none of the merchandizing products won't sell of decline in a way that it will not be profitable to try another shot.It was fun. Doesn't need to go to the theatre for it and it ends pretty quickly. I will not remember this movie in two days and it is not that bad. It acts as a classic franchise that wants to milk each and every dollar from his young sponsored audience and it does all of it in a fun way, so probably it will not be hated ever again.The bar is set pretty low and no plans to take the next step, so it is pretty disappointing to the grown up audience, but if you don't have any issue with a stuck concept for a movie series for young kids, you probably enjoy the short time of watching this movie with your kids.",6.0,BoBo_Goal32,2024-09-12,0.0,0.0

519182,No summary,"Despicable Me 4 is yet another instalment in the franchise that provides, if nothing else, a non-stop fun time for kids and just enough entertainment for adults as well.There's a particular tracking shot of the Minions enacting random, chaotic stuff around an office setting that probably best summarises the entire movie's end goal; to entertain by any PG-13 means possible. The Minions gags rarely fail to entertain, used effectively enough as comic relief rather than a full-blown b-plot like in Despicable Me 3, aside from the near pointless inclusion of the regardlessly funny Mega Minions. The gags from the Minions feel fresh enough, the animation is great, and the soundtrack is another fun one, although continues the trend of feeling more like a playlist.After the third main film, and now this fourth one, it's much clearer that this is very much a franchise primarily for kids now, rather than families. The villain is very interesting, yet spends too much time journeying towards enacting his plan than actually enacting it, making him feel like lesser of a threat than he was initially built up to be. Gru's daughters and Lucy all feel enormously faded into obscurity in favour of Joey King's character, almost as if they were included by necessity. There's also no real story driving the endless gags, creating a lack in direction.In conclusion, it's a good enough time to entertain kids, but ultimately proves that this franchise is steadily declining in overall quality.",6.0,kademan-40962,2024-09-09,0.0,0.0
519182,No summary,"A sequel that does not meet the expectations of innovation, creativity, and good cinematic development. ""Despicable Me 4"" makes the same mistakes as its predecessor, and perhaps even worse, resulting in a film that only gives you a few laughs and a handful of entertaining moments. Director Chris Renaud left much to be desired, with very poor execution and failing to make the most of a rather enjoyable saga.The Illumination studio failed to deliver a decent story, falling far short of the third installment and being, by a long shot, a mediocre film, nonsensical and with significant inconsistencies in its script. A script written by Mike White and Ken Daurio that definitely resulted in a pyrrhic, lazy, and flat effort. A cheap plot that doesn't connect with any of the arguments presented in this fourth installment. The addition of so many meaningless subplots makes the feature film boring in many of its scenes. Without a doubt, if we had eliminated so many unnecessary moments, this could have lasted 35 minutes at most. Creativity has been forgotten.The excellent animation should be highlighted. Here, there is quite an admirable piece of work with a spectacular level of detail. A section that improved considerably and speaks for itself. The color tones in each segment, scene, characters, and environments are sublime, much better than in previous installments. The fluidity and choreography of action and comedy moments are applause-worthy. The soundtrack also has its great moments.""Despicable Me 4"" has a large number of movie references from a comedic and parodic perspective, but it also has its entertaining moments, films like: Spider-Man 2, Harry Potter, The Avengers, Justice League, among others.Speaking of characters, perhaps the most notable are baby Gru Jr. And the Minions, providing that comedic touch with the help of the script. They are the ones who have those most memorable scenes and provide a different sense of comfort while watching the movie. However, this sequel is a clear example of wasted characters, from Gru, Lucy Wilde, and a villain who literally does nothing but be detestable. Maxime Le Mal is the worst villain in the entire franchise, with fatal motivations, no solid arguments, and someone you forget as soon as the film ends. Horrible.The sustainability of the film is not feasible, it doesn't add anything more, it doesn't have a good ending, and it is unnecessarily prolonged. It's a sequel with a collection of short films connected together, but for what purpose? A bad decision accompanied by a terrible execution.Our favorite villain Gru has had one of his worst feats, being consumed by the well-being of a dysfunctional comedy and being sidelined by less interesting characters.Even so, those little moments of laughter, the animation, the music, and one or two characters make the movie decent. Being better than other animated films of the year.",6.0,thomasubieda,2024-09-08,0.0,0.0
519182,No summary,"This film had all the potential to be a worthy continuation of the franchise, but it sadly feels like more of a rerun than a fresh addition. Sure, the animation is top-notch, and the entertainment value is still there to some degree, but the film ultimately stumbles in delivering a compelling plot. It feels like the writers chose the safest, most derivative direction instead of taking risks that could have breathed new life into the series.The villain here is one of the biggest letdowns. Compared to the menacing threats we've seen before-like Balthazar Bratt in the last film-this new antagonist just doesn't measure up. The lack of intimidation and presence makes the stakes feel lower, and it's hard to care about the outcome when the bad guy feels like a watered-down version of past villains.The overuse of the Minions is another sticking point. While I get they've been a fan-favorite, their antics take center stage way too often. They already have their own spin-off franchise, so it feels unnecessary-and honestly, a bit distracting-to see them hog so much screen time here. Their slapstick humor, which worked in small doses in previous films, is now overbearing and detracts from the central plot. If you're not a huge fan of the Minions, this will feel more like a chore than a joy.Another glaring issue is the absence of key characters like Dru, Gru's twin brother, whose disappearance isn't even justified. His dynamic with Gru in the previous film was one of the more refreshing parts of the franchise, and leaving him out makes the plot feel incomplete. You're left wondering why they didn't follow up on that storyline instead of rehashing old ground.That said, the movie isn't without its charms. The animation is visually stunning, as we've come to expect from the Despicable Me""l franchise, and there are a few genuinely funny and heartfelt moments. Kids will still enjoy the colorful chaos, but for anyone who's followed the series from the start, this feels like it's running on fumes. It's more of the same, and not in a good way.In the end, this is entertaining enough for a casual viewing, but it's nowhere near as innovative or engaging as it could have been. It feels like a missed opportunity, a film that could have gone in a hundred different directions but settled for the path of least resistance.

There's no reason the movie needs to lack flow to make room for the minions. The movie feels like a bunch of loosely connected scenes with no tension, stakes, or wit.

Whether you watch this film or not, it doesn't affect your knowledge about the film's universe. In other words, it's a film that starts in the same place it started, they just introduce another character who has a drama in relation to Gru that is quickly resolved when the script needs it.Apart from the number of plots that the film proposes and when it comes to resolving them all in the final act, there is that feeling that something was still left open.In conclusion, this is an episodic film that only serves to entertain children, now you, the parent, will only find it a forgettable film, which is exactly what it is 6/10.",6.0,jomoxshift,2024-08-31,1.0,0.0

With the release of Despicable Me 4, the franchise continues to delight fans and newcomers alike. This latest installment brings back the lovable anti-hero Gru, his adorable daughters, and, of course, the mischievous Minions, who steal the show once again. Despicable Me 4 follows Gru as he navigates the challenges of parenthood and villainy. In this film, Gru and his family embark on a new adventure when a villain threatens their peaceful life.

The film brilliantly balances action and emotional moments, reminding viewers of the importance of family and friendship. One of the standout aspects of Despicable Me 4 is the introduction of a new antagonist, who adds depth to the storyline. This villain, while comically exaggerated, presents a genuine challenge for Gru, forcing him to confront his past and embrace his role as a father. The dynamic between Gru and the new villain creates engaging conflicts, leading to hilarious and heartwarming moments throughout the film. While Gru and his daughters are central to the story, the Minions remain the true stars of the Despicable Me series. Their antics and comedic timing provide much of the film's charm and humor.

The game show format allows for even more comedic moments, showcasing the Minions' knack for turning every situation into chaos. The ""Total Knockout"" sequences are filled with over-the-top obstacles and zany challenges that are visually captivating. The animation is vibrant and dynamic, capturing the spirit of friendly competition while highlighting the importance of teamwork. Viewers are treated to a colorful array of settings and challenges that keep the energy high and the laughs rolling. What truly sets Despicable Me 4 apart is its ability to combine humor with heartfelt moments.

Their slapstick comedy and nonsensical language are guaranteed to elicit giggles from both children and adults.

There are several subplots vying for attention, and none of them are fully developed. The main villain's motivations are unclear, and the resolution feels rushed.

519182,No summary,"As someone who has watched the Despicable Me 1-2 and 3 movies very fondly, I can say that this movie is very childish. It's a seriously childish and under-13 film. One or two of the jokes seemed funny to me. The motivation of the film's main villain is also not childish, but infantile. It was a very ordinary movie in which we could not see Gru's talents and the Minions' unnecessary conversations increased. I'm sorry they made such a bad movie for such a series. The 4th movie of Kung Fu Panda was also insufficient, but not like this. I was disappointed. I felt sorry for the money I paid for the movie ticket. I don't recommend it to watch.

She doesn't seem to still have her moxie like when she first introduced to the audience. The plot is also still the same. The minions are getting tiresome, even when after they do something different with them this time. The baby is the only thing that makes a difference.

519182,No summary,"This film is the latest installment in the Despicable Me franchise, and follows Gru, his family-now with the addition of his mischievous baby boy-and the Minions. When Gru's arch-nemesis, Maxime Le Mal, whom Gru had previously imprisoned, vows to hunt down Gru and his family, the Anti-Villain League places them in a protection program, giving them new identities and a temporary new life. Meanwhile, the Minions, jobless, are experimented on by the AVL to gain superpowers. As the family adjusts to their new lives, Gru's true identity is discovered by a member of the community named Poppy. To keep his secret safe, Gru must assist her with a high-stakes heist, or risk exposing his family. But when Maxime Le Mal locates Gru and endangers his loved ones, Gru, Lucy and the mega minions must stop him and save their family before he transforms the entire world into cockroaches like himself. Overall, due to its signature animation, intriguing story, all-star voice cast, standout villian and funny moments, this movie was a solid addition to this universe and even though the series has started to feel a bit repetitive, they still consistently retain a unique charm and level of enjoyment that makes them fun every time, and this entry is no different and is a short but sweet experience that shouldn't be missed.",7.0,Dylpickle08,2024-08-16,1.0,0.0
519182,No summary,"Let me be honest for a bit. It's tough to deeply despise the Despicable Me films. Granted, it's not a secret that Illumination is the laziest or the most dull animation in the business right now. However, there's some charm to them. Not only that but they're specifically made for a younger audience and are often the most difficult to be critical of. So as long as the kids are enjoying it, there's little to be said about it. With that being said, it's just decent. It's pretty middle-of-the-road in terms of quality. I'd be shocked if anyone was talking about this in a few days. What you see is what you get. That alone, it's an entertaining time. This is way more polished than the last Despicable Me film and the first Minions film. It's the longest break between them because it's up there with the original, from the humor to the story. There are a lot more rights than wrongs. The animation is solid per usual. There are some sweet moments here. The voice performances are great as usual. I was surprised by Will Ferrell's voice performance. If I hadn't known it was him, it would've taken a while to notice it. To have this man star as the villain straight out of a David Cronenberg film is hysterically strange. It's still rather formulaic. It goes as you expect with little to no surprises. Not every joke lands but the Minions did. The idea of Mega Minions feels like it should have come out a few years ago when the superhero genre was huge. The twist is endearing enough but once again, it's quite predictable. It's another average animated movie from Illumination. If a studio like Pixar or Laika made it, it would've been more creative. To be fair though, it did go further than what we're used to. If they keep making these (which I'm sure they are), I'll keep watching them even if they're not probably not going to be masterpieces. It is what it is at this point. You only recommend this to the kids.",6.0,tiaskyelandish,2024-08-15,3.0,0.0
519182,No summary,"I Loved numbers 1 and 2, and Despicable Me 3 was a pleasant surprise. However in the new installment, there just feels like something is missing. Maybe it was the quality of the writing In 1, 2 and 3. Or the engaging and interesting storylines all of those films had, Like steeling the moon, a Dance off, A really well dressed suite guy in number 2? Whatever it is, It's definitely missing in this new installment of the franchise. Which may of been an indication of already being burnt out. So let's review ""Despicable Me 4"" huh Despicable me.The one thing, you can praise It's effects, which are superb. The into shows off It's wonderful colour palet. It's beautifully light colour tone, which perfectly embodies the tone of the film. We also get to see some beautifully wide shots of the Roads and even some other things in the background like the Mountains, which makes this feel unique and exciting in many ways. Because we get to see it in a different lens and a new perspective on the franchise.Where number 4 falls flat, it falls on It's heels, where it does right, it does it pretty superbly. However, the villains lacked depth, and they seemed to of brushed over there storyline. And it makes them uninteresting as protagonists, as we don't get to know much about them. Yeah sure, we get to see there personalities shine, but it never goes in a deeper level and everything about them just seems Serfice level at best. What worked perfectly about the other 3, was the interesting ideas the villains had, and we sort of had an idea of what they wanted to accomplish, which music they liked, and what sort of person they were like from Childhood. The stakes and the direction they took with the villains here, seem to be a major step backwards in terms of there villainous arcs.Number 4 also has a weak storyline, it's been mentioned countless of times by others on the app, and they have a great point. What worked in the other 3 films was the storytelling, the craftsmanship and even it feeling well fleshed out and long. Despicable Me 4 seems to have a storyline that would maybe work in a 30 or 45 minute Tv Show Probably, but it doesn't work here when your movie is heavily stretched out in a 90 minute film. Which was a sign of lacking some ideas, and not being able to adapt the franchise in an interesting way, whilst also not going in a great direction either.The Prison scene was comedy gold and had me laughing. And seeing all of the villains in the former films made for a fun surprise and there appearance definitely felt earned, and that's down to the fact they are well established. I could go on for hours about the Movies Problems and how some stuff worked. However, Believe me we'd be here all day. I have missed bits. But these are the points I mostly wanted to get across. So the big question really.Would I recommend this Movie?I felt as if it was incomplete, So no. Unless your a diehard fan, then I suggest you just avoid.",4.0,rohanumpleby-34057,2024-08-13,2.0,1.0
519182,No summary,"Despicable Me 4 starts off strong with an opening scene that had me hooked, especially with Pharrell Williams' catchy song setting the tone. The Minions, as always, are a delight, and their interactions continue to be one of the film's highlights.The new villain, Maxime Le Mal, feels more formidable than previous adversaries, raising the stakes for Gru and his family. Gru's lines seemed odd at first - stupid and foolish - but they actually serve a purpose in the story, which I found interesting. The Karate Sensei character, however, came across as overly foolish and didn't add much to the film.While the film introduces some original ideas, the execution falls flat. Despite this, the writing effectively explores themes like manipulation, teamwork, and the blurred lines between superheroes and supervillains, which I appreciated.The film maintains its wholesome moments, and I loved the introduction of the mega Minions. The chase scene with Lucy was a fun watch, keeping the energy high. The OST remains true to the series, staying consistent with its predecessors. There are a few pop culture references sprinkled throughout, though I felt the film could have done with a couple fewer of these.The ending of the film is satisfying, and I believe it wraps up the story well.

519182,No summary,"They're just not putting the effort in. This film was perfunctory, a few separate ideas behind different set-pieces and nothing really tying it together. The super-powered minions who are the focus of so much marketing are barely in it, and pointless. Gru's new baby son is nothing but plot point, there's no family dynamics on show. A waste of Will Ferrell as a supervillain with no supervillainy outside of threatening Gru. This film is really lazy family blockbuster-by-numbers stuff.It terms of animation, the film looks as good as ever, plenty of attention to detail throughout and a nice bright colour palette. I liked the idea of the neighbour teenager wannabe supervillain. But it's typical of this movie that, only introduced mid-way through and given one set-piece, she turns up from nowhere at the end in chitty-chitty-bang-bang to rescue the master story.Despicable Me 3 was pretty poor as well. Right now I got to go see these films because I still have one kid (of three) under 10. If we get the same gap before the next one that we did between this and the last Minions movie, she'll have aged out of the franchise and with any luck I won't have to bother taking them again.

519182,No summary,"Look, I like Will Ferrell, okay? I think he's a very talented comedic actor. But stunt casting isn't always the best idea. And especially not when you hire one of the biggest names for your movie but decide to have him do a French accent which he cannot pull off and which makes his voice pretty much unrecognizable to the audience. (I think part of it was also that perhaps he was trying so hard to do the accent that he forgot to actually put any nuance into the role.)Another poor casting choice was Sofia Vergara. Sofia was very funny on Modern Family, and on paper it probably seemed like she'd be pretty good in an animated role because her line delivery on that show was often the source of the humor. But she brings nothing to the table here, and as a result her character fell totally flat.When you compare those two to nearly every other voice actor in the cast, the difference becomes even more egregious.Other than that, however, this is not a particularly well-written or well-directed sequel. If your kids love the minions, they will probably have a good time, as there are enough of their shenanigans to keep the younger crowd entertained.

The first film was about Gru realising that there was more to life than his career and this film continues his journey into being a parent as he attempts to bond with his new baby boy. Having three adopted daughters already Gru would be mistaken for thinking that having a young boy of his own would be easy.A large plot point in the film is a dad trying his best to bond with his new born son and although he finds it difficult his persistence prevails.I couldn't helped but have my heart warmed by Gru the family man.Now for the not so great, the villain this time around is by far the least memorable despicable me/minions villain.Maxime is voiced by Will Ferrell with an almost caricature of a French accent.Like all of the villains in this franchise he's larger than life but to be honest he just didn't seem that threatening and had a pittance of screen time for such an important character.I of course can't talk about Despicable Me without mentioning the yellow, banana loving, bane of every parents existence, the minions!Considering they're such a large part of this franchise's success they have very little to do this time around.They are given their own little subplot which revolves around a small number of them being voluntarily experimented on and becoming so called Mega Minions.It doesn't really lead to anything though and seemed to be there just to give the minions something to do as they aren't involved in the main narrative.What do you call a redneck minion?A Maga-Minion.Probably would have been a better villain to be honest.There is of course the usual slapstick humour that I enjoy because I'm mentally still a child.

519182,No summary,"I finally broke down and stopped putting off seeing Despicable Me 4. And let me tell you, I wish I hadn't. Despicable Me 4 is abysmal. I hoped after Migration was so good that maybe Illumination was turning around, but Despicable Me 4 proves that wasn't the case. This movie is exclusively for kids, it's no Pixar or Dreamworks movie that anyone could enjoy. Heck, it doesn't even have a story to it - most of the plot comes off as filler until the very end, and even then nothing ever really seems to happen. The jokes are exactly what you'd expect, and honestly the animation made me think the film was rapidly thrown together. I know this movie isn't made for me, but as someone who did like the original and the first sequel, I gotta say this franchise is a hollow shell of what it once was. Not to mention, they literally added aspects to the film just for marketing - the Mega Minions for instance have no consequence to the plot/story of the film aside from one isolated scene. There is no substance to this film at all... it's just so, so dumb. The popcorn was good though!",2.0,parksiet,2024-08-03,1.0,0.0
519182,No summary,"Let's start with the positives. The movie features several entertaining action scenes accompanied by excellent animation and a dynamic energy that carries throughout. It was an enjoyable and fun experience overall, but the story felt somewhat lightweight. The film lacked a cohesive storyline, with various side plots that didn't align with the main narrative. Although there was a villain pursuing Gru, the focus seemed to shift away from this central plot point in favor of unrelated events (trying not to spoil the movie here).There was a great opportunity for creativity with Gru's new baby, who could have been a fantastic addition to the franchise, similar to Jack-Jack from The Incredibles. Unfortunately, this potential was underutilized, and the character's development felt overlooked. The concept of ""Mega Minions"" also had great promise and could have expanded the story creatively, but their role in the film was underwhelming and not fully explored.The movie also suffered from a lack of significant interactions between the villain and Gru, likely due to the chaotic nature of the side plots, which left less time for these crucial encounters. The humor felt somewhat recycled, with minion jokes/actions similar to those in previous Despicable Me and Minions movies.Overall, if you're looking for a lighthearted and fun experience, this movie will deliver. However, the storyline doesn't add much in terms of continuing from the previous films, so don't expect significant new developments or advancements in the plot.",4.0,roadyarrow_y,2024-08-01,1.0,0.0

But this is actually a very smart and well written story about Gru's story coming full-circle and the ""rise"" to his power. Gru isn't playing around anymore, and he is the boss now.This ending goes HARD. I'm not going to spoil it, but let's just say Gru becomes ""that"" guy. Everything plays into each other for the storytelling. Even the Minion's shenanigans, which are usually just quick gags in the other movies, they're now meaningful elements that provide to the story. The minions feel like actual characters now, and their antics are so funny.The whole movie just gives me chills thinking about how cool it was.

The signature minion scenes are, as always, laugh-out-loud hilarious and a guaranteed highlight.However, the ""Super Minions"" concept falls flat. It feels like an unnecessary detour from the established humor and charm of the regular minions. Additionally, the movie gives short shrift to Gru's adopted daughters, Margo, Edith, and Agnes. Their absence is noticeable, creating a slight imbalance in the film's heart.The focus on Gru himself is a double-edged sword. While it's nice to delve deeper into his character, the execution feels lacking. We don't quite get the edge or complexity we might have hoped for from his character development.Sum up - Despicable Me 4 is entertaining, but not quite as stellar as its predecessors.

Pharell Williams made a brilliant song for a terrebile movie. To say the movie was unsatisfactory would be under exaggerated as this movie brought nothing new and just for them to get past the mark of being called a Pixar short, they filled it with boring, meaningless scenes that didn't contribute to the ""plot"" at all. Simply an idea off the top of the writers head as they seemed to have no idea of where to really bring it.

This was a massive step down from the other 3.Id argue one of the key things about the previous movies were there banger and iconic villians but the villian in this one was kind of bland and uninteresting.

The relocation side story along with the relationship building with gru junior were far more worthy of my attention. Additionally the story with Poppy was in my opinion much better than the main plot line. The characters in the main are enjoyable and I laughed out loud a few times with My Wife and Daughter.

519182,No summary,"Disappointed by the latest instalment of this franchise. I am unsure if it is designed to be a parody of a number of other films or if they have simply run out of ideas. There was nothing new, it felt like a film I have seen before many times. A few jokes, but less standout moments and engaging storylines than the other films within the Despicable Me catalogue. Despite the addition of even more big Hollywood names into the saga (Will Ferrell, Joey King, Sofia Vergara), Steve Carell and the Minions continue to steal the show. It was a fun film and had its moments, but overall a bit disappointing unfortunately.",5.0,akd-08060,2024-07-15,3.0,0.0

I'm 26 years old and I've seen all the Despicable Me and minion movies and this one might have had my favorite plot. I liked it there really wasn't one main villain plot, and that we got funny jokes, good music, and got to see old characters. I had a smile on my face start to finish, and I would easily watch it again as soon as it's on streaming. I watched it in a theater where the seats moved in that added to the action.

519182,No summary,"With a good cast but low effort writing they were able to create an entertaining but unnecessary closing to the story. It honestly felt more like those Christmas special extras studios like to do. Shallow plot with easy to forget new characters and main villain. Not way to squeeze some money from whatever was left of the story's soul.I say check it out, laugh a bit, enjoy the closing which feels like a goodbye to all the previous characters, and forget you saw it.Best part was a musical piece at the end.Lastly, can't believe they tried to replace our favorite minion squad with a mediocre new trio and a squad of superheroes that give you some laugh but don't actually do anything in the whole movie.",6.0,ianvidal-trinidad,2024-07-14,0.0,1.0

I guess that was the desired effect.----Gru, a reformed supervillain with a penchant for interpretive dance (especially the tango, as previously mentioned), finds himself embroiled in a caper of epic proportions. This time, the villain du jour is none other than Bartholomew Fancypants, a sentient pair of lederhosen with a Napoleon complex and a vocabulary composed entirely of limericks. Bartholomew's nefarious plot involves shrinking the moon with a rogue cheese grater and using the resulting lunar dust to power his army of tap-dancing hamsters.

519182,No summary,"Illumination has made a ridiculous amount of money from the DESPICABLE ME franchise, including the oh so popular MINIONS installments. As there is no stopping this money train, DESPICABLE ME 4 has come out. Gru (Steve Carell) and his family are back, including a new baby, even though the other kids are still the same age. In this one, they are forced into witness protection due to a new villain Maxime (Will Farrell) who swears to take his revenge after Gru humiliated him. The minions are forced to go to AVL (Anti-Villain League) headquarters. While there, they do the exact same thing that the last PAW PATROL movie did and gave them super-powers. The story is simple, but I really enjoy slapstick ""Three Stooges"" humor so I was having a blast. The writing felt relatable if you have kids. There really isn't that much more to say about this one. I had a fun, simple time. Illumination really knows the formula to bring kids and adults to their movies.

519182,No summary,"I think for any franchise to continue into sequels they need to evolve and change, if you keep the same patterns, same character types and same kinda plot then audiences especially now will decline because cinema is expansive.But I much preferred this one to the point I actually think it's my favourite, Gru as a bumbling good guy being manipulated by a young girl and desperately trying to get love of his bang son was a great new idea, I felt the kids weren't featured quite enough in this one, especially Agnes who's just the cutest. The humour is kid friendly and adults will enjoy.Some review said this made their kid cry for days, it's not scary, despite it being insects, they are actually sweet looking so nothing remotely scary about the villain, it was actually a good idea given their reputation.The neighbours were a fun addition as was the school setting, seeing the family go into hiding aswell was another fun new twist to the standard. Seeing Gru without control and struggling to get the upper hand was far more fun.Having him as a bumbling dad and shining a light on other characters including young girls is a fun direction with endless possibilities, gets kids involved, can make female heroes, male, animal or whatever, this new direction has endless potential.The minions were the best since the original, hilarious and again a fun fresh way of trying to use them.Cant fault this film. I genuinely was having a bad day and I adored this and laughed a lot. Very well put together, well thought out and bravo for trying a new idea.10/10.",10.0,chris_rowe-881-168820,2024-07-14,0.0,6.0
519182,No summary,"Despicable Me 4 is operating on fumes. Just like last time it's a bunch of random side plots that just gets it to feature length (credits included). Still, even when these films are operating at a lower level they really understand not to waste your time with another 90 minutes of zany, erratic slapstick that peaks whenever the Minions are on screen, which once again is not enough.Steve Carell sounds less like Gru and more like himself with every new instalment but he's still the sole voice actor holding the whole thing together and in this one, he's broader than ever. Will Ferrell and Sofia Vegara very quickly earn the title of worst villains in this franchise (Minions films included) with grating vocal performances that go for caricature in very annoying fashion.The Minions remain really funny even in small doses despite the fact that there's nothing here as memorable as their big musical number in 3. The Mega Minions are by far the best idea this one has as it allows the film to poke some fun at superhero movies and keep their dynamic fresh. They should've been in it so much more instead of being relegated to a small handful of scenes.Chris Renaud's direction certainly gives the film a lot of energy with the hyperactive pace which can barely stay still. The opening offers the false promise of this one having some genuine stakes before quickly pivoting away from that and turning the film into the cinematic equivalent of a sugar rush which helps to keep things moving at speed even when the jokes aren't landing.",6.0,masonsaul,2024-07-13,55.0,11.0

519182,No summary,"""Despicable Me 4"" is a mixed bag that might leave some fans wanting more. The movie, which I rate a 5 out of 10, unfortunately feels like it cut corners, particularly in its action sequences. The fighting scenes, which are a staple of the series' high-energy style, felt noticeably truncated. This lack of extended action left a sense of incompleteness, making the film's pacing seem uneven.However, the film is not without its merits. There are some genuinely funny moments that capture the charm of the series, reminding us why we fell in love with Gru, the Minions, and their antics in the first place. The humor, while sporadic, still manages to evoke laughter and maintains the whimsical spirit of the previous installments.The plot, while serviceable, doesn't break new ground. It follows a familiar formula, which might be comforting for some viewers but predictable for others. The new characters introduced did not add much depth to the story, and the development of existing characters seemed stagnant.Visually, ""Despicable Me 4"" maintains the bright and colorful animation style that the franchise is known for, which is a definite plus. The Minions continue to steal scenes with their slapstick humor, but even their antics can't fully compensate for the film's shortcomings.In summary, ""Despicable Me 4"" delivers some laughs and retains the visual appeal of its predecessors, but it falls short in terms of action and character development. While it's an enjoyable watch for die-hard fans, it doesn't quite capture the magic of the earlier films in the series.",5.0,schmittfalte,2024-07-12,18.0,3.0

As well as being witty and relatable, this film knew when to tackle dark issues; such as abuse of animals and workers, one of the minions issues with gambling was addressed, the effects of the beauty industry and plastic surgery on the modern personage, as well as the Frenchness of main villain Maxime, portrayed wonderfully by Will Ferrel. But through all the darkness the lighthearted tone of the film as well as the inspiring ark of some of the characters, especially the minion in the vending machine at the of the film (his journey brought me to tears) were truly breathtaking.All in all, this film was for me, without a doubt, the greatest film I have seen since Interstellar and 12 Angry Men, if we are to not count the previous installment in this cinematic universe.

Up to this point, it has all been comedic and artistic brilliance. But DM4 managed to stagnate the franchise.

These newcomers bring new interactions and storylines, preventing the movie from feeling too repetitive. The humor, which ranges from clever wordplay to physical comedy, ensures that both children and adults find something to laugh at.However, despite these new elements, the film sometimes struggles with originality.

The emotional moments, though present, don't carry the same weight as in the previous films, making them less impactful.The animation quality is exceptional, with vibrant colors and detailed character designs that bring the story to life. The attention to detail in the backgrounds and action sequences is particularly impressive, showcasing the technical prowess of the animators.Voice acting continues to be a highlight, with Steve Carell delivering a charismatic performance as Gru.

Another observation: as we progressed from the first installment to this one, the minions' role has become less significant, which disappoints me since they were the reason I initially enjoyed these films. The voice cast remains incredibly strong, with accents and tones perfectly enhancing the movie's comedic aspect.Score:6.5/10.",6.0,wackoreviews,2024-07-08,13.0,1.0

519182,No summary,"Despicable Me 4 (2024) :
Movie Review -Chris Renaud brings the 6th installment in the Despicable Me franchise, with Gru, his new baby, and minions becoming ""mega minions."" From the trailer, we had this idea that there is a scientific experiment and minions are transformed into beasts, but the actual film is much different and about many more things. The mega minions are fun but are wasted, just like many other subplots of the film. It could have definitely served better, but nevertheless, it was a family entertainer-half kiddish fun and half adult fun.Undercover Anti-Villain League (AVL) agent Gru attends a class reunion at his former high school, Lycée Pas Bon, where he reencounters Maxime Le Mal and arrests him. Maxime swears to exterminate Gru and escapes from jail. Gru and his family are advised to shift to a safe house, while Maxine is planning to kidnap Gru's new baby. Gru and his family move to a new place, much to everybody's reluctance, and find themselves alone and bored. To add some adventure to it, a neighbour girl takes Gru on a heist, along with, by default, two minions and a baby. You must be thinking about the third minion, right? Well, he was asleep in a cooler. Another wasted thing. The heist, followed by Maxime's return, and the obvious face-off between these two are what take the story to the finish.Despicable Me 4 has a good screenplay, as it doesn't make you feel bored. Those 90 minutes are quick and easy, much to everybody's concern; a few laughs and a few flaws walk hand-in-hand. It could have definitely been much more funny and mature, though. Apparently, it's a family film and has been followed by the same audience over the years. That section also includes kids, and that's why Chris Renud and company had to be so thin and simple about a few things. It doesn't suit critics at all. Do we care? I guess no-if the box office numbers speak. If they don't, then it's definitely time to shift gears for the franchise.Despicable Me has been through so many cliches already that nothing is really left off. That's why you see some spoofs coming in to serve fresh dishes. Marvel has the Fantastic Four, and DM 4 has its fantastic five mega minions. I was a kid when Tobey Maguire split his spider web and stopped the train, and now I am an adult. I saw one of the mega minions doing the same-only to go wrong. A few cheek-friendly laughs like this keep you engaged, but that won't let you overlook the number of flaws it has. The antagonist deserved more space, and the cast seemed overcrowded. These are the basic flaws we are talking about, and I don't want to get into much detail since the film was never supposed to be that intelligent.The voice cast of Steve Carell, Kristen Wiig, Pierre Coffin, Joey King, Miranda Cosgrove, Steve Coogan, Sofía Vergara, Renaud, Madison Polan, Dana Gaier, Chloe Fineman, Stephen Colbert, and Will Ferrell does well, as expected. The visuals aren't breathtaking, but fine. Catching it on the X screen didn't help much, but I definitely miss the ""Minions"" (2015) kind of magic. It's too quick to absorb, and maybe that's why it feels too short. Unlike the previous films, this one focuses more on the crowd's entertainment than the story. That might suit many.Chris Renaud does more of a fan service than being creative and maverick to set new examples. The film follows all the given templates to deliver a time-pass popcorn entertainer. It's just that we are getting used to it, even with cute animation images. That new baby is so cute, but don't tell me you haven't seen such cute babies before. Somebody has a panda; somebody has a cat; somebody does it with toys; and some do it with robbers. Illumination does it with a hero-like baddie, that's all. Go and have fun if you know what to expect and not to expect more than that. The wait of 7 years, however, deserved a better one, of course.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest.",6.0,SAMTHEBESTEST,2024-07-08,0.0,2.0

519182,No summary,"Now, I've been a fan of these Despicable Me Movies since 2010 and I've loved all of the movie in a variety of different qualities. However, there was a part of me that wasn't necessarily excited for this movie and that's a big surprise for me. Now that I've watched the movie and I can honestly say that while I did like this movie, we've officially come to the point where the Despicable Me Franchise is starting to feel played out.Positives for Despicable Me 4 (2024):
There is still a lot of fun that can be had with this set of characters and honestly these movies won't survive without them. I enjoyed that this movie has a wide variety of different characters with their own distinct personalities and charisma. I really enjoyed the addition of Joey King as Poppy Prescott as one of the the neighbor characters to the Gru Family. I liked the fact that the Gru Family has to figure out how they need to adapt to a new neighborhood. I really enjoyed the journey that Gru goes on with his infant son Gru Jr. Where at the beginning of the movie, Gru Jr. Hates his father and then eventually starts to like his father at he end of the movie. And finally, the minions are still a lot of fun with their insane antics.Mixed for Despicable Me 4 (2024):
The main issue that I have with this movie is the screenplay and that's primarily because the two screenwriters of this movie are Mike White, the creator of The White Lotus (2021-) and Ken Daurio, the screenwriter of multiple Illumination Animated Movies. And while I do enjoy what both of these guys bring to the table with their writing, their styles of writing do not feel compatible with each other in term of how they write their characters, construct their stories, the tone that they're going for and the themes that they want to explore. It literally feels the movie is trying to figure out what it wants to be throughout the runtime.Negatives for Despicable Me 4 (2024):
Similar to Despicable Me 3 (2017), Dr. Nefario is not in this movie, with the exception of a small cameo. And finally, the villains of both Maxime Le Mal and Valentina are by far the weakest in the franchise which is bizarre because they are voiced by Will Ferrell and Sofia Vergara respectively.Overall, Despicable Me 4 (2024) is still a fun movie within this franchise but we've reached the point where this franchise is starting to feel played out and that's not a good thing.",7.0,jared-25331,2024-07-07,63.0,10.0
519182,No summary,"Gru (Steve Carell) and his family go into protective custody to avoid the wrath of Maxime Le Mal (Will Farrell), Gru's maximum enemy and a blowhard of the first order who is also part cockroach. Besides the sheer imagination with the filmmakers responsible for Despicable Me 4 and the sixth installment in the franchise, actual philosophical underpinnings lie behind innumerable gags in both sight and sound.Like rival Pixar productions, Despicable's Illumination Entertainment puts as much into the script as the blindingly beautiful colors and distinctive character shapes. Who can deny the wit inherent in Gru's long pointy nose evocative of Pinocchio and amusing with a banana stuck on it? Or the fusion of silly with sightly sarcasm in the Minions' helmets? Or Poppy's (Joey King) just right braces? Or monster-truck-sized tires on a wheel chair? And on and on-sight and sound create ""I must come back to appreciate it all.""As for the thin plot, the struggle against Maxime is a throwback to ancient story telling where evil is easy to spot and the struggle easy to follow. However, when the animation breaks out into a cover of Tears for Fears' ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World,"" the filmmakers subtly show the films thematic application to world politics right now.Some critics criticize the franchise for tossing off gags, 'throwaway"" if you will. Yet, if you go back to listen carefully, those loose gags are often germane to the plot and the world. Despicable Me 4 is filled with humor and philosophy if it's given a chance.In this intensely hot summer, cool off with this witty animation in your local cinema, still the coolest bargain any summer.",,JohnDeSando,2024-07-07,1.0,1.0

I didn't even crack a smile. This movie also had the worst villain in the series, even though they are voiced by Will Ferrell.

519182,No summary,"First of all, as a 21 year old, I did feel a little out of place in the cinema, that's why I love night sessions. But I am glad I stuck through the awkwardness, this was a wonderful addition to the series.The story makes sense in the established universe, and for the most part feels like a natural progression of the character's arcs from previous editions. Getting to see how Gru continues to change with the influence of the girls, now with a full family and established lives individually as well as together, is wonderful and really does add to the stakes.Agnes is still the lovable and innocently simple minded little girl who initially broke through to Gru and started the whole process of de-eviliing him and the minions.Edith is still the pessimist and realist that works to contrast everything and make the actions really stand out.Margo continues to be the voice of the audience, highlighting how Gru's actions do have adverse effects, whether positive or not.The minions have even improved, it feels like they've been wound back just a little, saving us from having essentially Rabbids from Springfield, and just having lovably stupid and invincible merchandise oppourtunities.It is AMAZING to get to see Gru return back to some of the more villainous elements of his character, but still from a positive light, we get to keep what we have, while regaining some of the awesome that we had to give up.I could happily watch DM4 many more times, and I probably will in future.",9.0,atomicaus,2024-07-07,4.0,5.0
519182,No summary,"I am only the target audience insofar as I am an older millenial with a young kid who wanted to take him to an age appropriate movie. Though familiar with the first movie, I haven't seen the sequels and I thought there would be some catching up I would have to do. The movie's plot requires little prior knowledge about the characters, however, it's clear that time has passed because the main character now has a baby in the family. The movie mentions he graduated from villain high school in 1985, so he's now in his 50s with a baby which is odd. Yet, the other kids in the household haven't aged. The movie introduces a new character named Poppy, sort of builds her personality and story, and then drops it and switches back to the new baby drama. The plot seemed like it was trying to pack in too many storylines and then it would cut to random minion shenanigans. I feel like the minions in the movie were unnecessary even though they're a huge part of this franchise. They were a distraction and I honestly felt like I couldn't focus on what was happening. Too many sidestories, too many gag jokes, humor that didn't appeal to me, dumb pop culture references that were targeted for parents my age but fell flat.

I wish it went hard on that rail but that plot is muddled in a lot of scenes for each family member, and the minions.Like... the main thing; the fight between gru and the big bad guy from this film is what i felt it wasn't properly developed, the other scenes with the family aren't bad but they don't feel connected to the overarching plot.Yes there are a lot of minions scenes but 1) most of them are funny and 2) they're not the main focus, they also don't last longThis is a good movie, worth the ticket for the entire family but it could've been more interesting.",7.0,mackarron,2024-07-07,10.0,8.0

519182,No summary,"""Despicable Me 4"" is the sixth film in under 15 years, following the adventures of the reformed supervillain Gru. The animated franchise's longtime director and producer, Chris Renaud, helms the film with a stream of high-octane B-plots, such as Gru's family struggling to adjust to witness protection, Gru mentoring his teenage neighbor, and the Minions becoming lab-grown superheroes. The movie stretches itself out in too many directions, largely shedding any meaningful charm or heart and struggling to cohere around a central story with actual stakes. This extends a problem in the franchise that began with the third film, which relied more on gimmicky narrative and visual pyrotechnics and empty slapstick. Despicable Me, a franchise that began with the 2010 original, has been a reliable box office draw, even with mixed reviews. The franchise has been a success, earning $1.159 billion at the box office in 2015, despite the lowest critics' and audience scores on Rotten Tomatoes. Despite occasional fun and a budget, the main focus is to keep the Minion cash cow chugging along. The franchise's success is attributed to its ability to tell genuine stories, even when critics' reviews are mixed. Despicable Me 4, the latest installment in Illumination Studio's popular franchise, follows Gru (Steve Carell) as he confronts the subtle villainy of suburban life in Mayflower. The film is directed by Chris Renaud and features a new setting, villain, and characters, including Gru and Lucy's newborn Gru Jr. The plot can sometimes feel chaotic, but White injects doses of his perennial interest in the social codes of the rich. The film begins with an exciting confrontation between Gru and Maxime Le Mal, a new villain who has been hiding from the Anti-Villain League since Despicable Me 3. After their school reunion, Gru is reinstated to the league to arrest Maxime. However, Maxime escapes the league's maximum security prison and records a video message vowing to ""exterminate Gru."" AVL boss Silas Ramsbottom (Steve Coogan) is spooked, so the organization relocates the Gru family, including Gru Jr., to Mayflower. The family's attempts to fit into Mayflower are highlighted in the film, with Gru swapping out his dark garb for khakis and pink polo shirts, Lucy becoming a world-class beautician, Margo attending a new junior high school, and Agnes and Edith attending a karate program run by a menacing instructor. This endeavor creates inventive sequences, including a high-stakes supermarket chase involving Lucy and the girls. The film's strong voice cast keeps the film engaging and nimble, with the plot being a zany B that becomes one of the film's strongest threads.",10.0,moviesfilmsreviewsinc,2024-07-05,6.0,8.0

519182,No summary,"Verdict: SKIP IT!Rating: 6.5/10I really wanted to like this movie but it was pretty disappointing. The movie didn't have much of a story and the scenes felt like they were all over the place. The laugh out loud moments were too far and few between. I feel like they relied too much on the minions slapstick comedy as opposed to focusing on character development and creating funny scenarios in the storyline.The villain was forgettable and not too impressive. The entire time it felt like there was nothing at stake. The only motivation for the villain was petty revenge. The thing that put me off the most in this movie was Gru's switch from a heel to a babyface. It just doesn't suit him or create funny moments. Gru is much funnier being the sarcastic wisecracking villain you love, not this tame neutered family man. He's much funnier popping kid's balloons and melting their ice cream then running around trying to please everyone.I do admit though that him now being a family man makes sense in the continuity of the story, however it does nothing to improve the comedic scenes of the storyline which is why we all watch these movies in the first place.I gave this movie a 6.5/10. It's not a good movie, but not a terrible one either. I feel that this movie was the weakest of the four and that this series has ran its course with nothing else left to offer.

I had a blast trying to pay attention to what the minions were actually saying and I picked-up Japanese ""oregato!"" And Italian foods "" Prosciutto"" ""antipasti"" ""pastrami"". The minions really make this highly enjoyable, very slapstick, and looney tunes like comedy. This 100% made-up for the terrible disney release Inside Out 2 which parents had to sit through last week.

519182,No summary,"I have watched all of the despicable me movies and this one stood out the most for sure. I have always been a fan of the silly little minions. From the ideas, comedy and music in this movie to the spectacular jokes, it was a wonder.Perfect movie for the family, friends or a romantic date night. This will lighten up the mood in any situation, I teared up of holding my laugh multiple times throughout this movie and not a single person was in a bad movie during this sensation.I need to be critical in this review, of course, so the things I would improve for the next movie is: more minions ! They had many moments of course, but it could be more balanced.Analysing the 3d models, animation and voice acting left me with a proud smile on my face, everything was on point. Honestly the choice of music was very well too, even though I personally don't like pop that much neither rap, it went well with all the moments. I'm also very happy they popped a bit of heavy metal and hard rock songs in some moments !In conclusion, an impressive, breathtaking, splendid and magnificent movie ! I don't see any reason to not like this nor not enjoy.

But you can't take a break from the lame story every 10 minutes and have a small Pixar short-like 8 minutes devoted to the minions. The movie went back and forth from story to minions, story to minions constantly I found myself checking my watch wondering when is this over.Please stop at 4 and come up with your next great series.

519182,No summary,"LIKES:Animated BeautifullyFun Voice ActingLots of Fun Movie ReferencesCuteEntertaining PaceSome Old Magic ReturnsReferences To Other DM moviesFunSUMMARY:
Illumination's design is entertaining and unique to make exaggerated features enjoyable, whimsical, and it sticks in your mind with the vibrant colors and light. The fourth movie keeps to these cards and has stunning animation that is familiar, fun, and enjoyable for viewers like me just looking for cartoon antics. Alongside fun voice acting, mainly led by Carell and Coffin, Despicable Me keeps being entertaining quips of complaining, awkward enthusiasm, and gibberish that still hasn't completely left me in being entertained to watch as the humor unleashes. The movie makes cute references to previous installments in the film, while also poking at Hollywood's television and movie traditions and the fans that admire them. It's clever at times and brings that magic of the first film back in balancing witty dialogue, emotional growth of characters, and slapstick humor that had me hooked in this series. In this case, a heist and an operation of the Minions are my particular favorites where things came together in the right way to show potential for this series. These moments are fleeting mind you, but when they do emerge, they shine and remind me why I love this series in terms of entertaining fun. Whatever your interests are in terms of wit vs. Silly, I think this movie still thrives in being cute and fun, perfect for the audiences coming to the theaters to see this in hopes of just taking a break from reality with this entertainment value.DISLIKES:The Story Is ChoppyA Bit Too Silly/MessyPredictableMediocre VillainsMore of the other charactersTried Too Much In One MovieSUMMARY
Despite this film being very fun and cute though, it's taken further steps from the magic of that first film. Primarily in story and balance, Despicable Me 4 had trailers portray a tale of new fatherhood and a new place in life after some concerns with the new villain in town. It sounds like something akin to movies one and two, but that fell to the wayside very quickly and became this choppy tale of three different groups that never quite reached the potential they were going for. It's a messy anthology with tales that struggle to fully mesh together, with predictable gimmicks and cliché finishes that did little to wow me. Mediocre villains that have limited involvement or attachment to the plot only weaken the story, making a thin backbone to build on for the sake of more silliness that had the younger members (and young at heart) laughing up a storm. Again, this is cute, but such sporadic handling of the purpose of this movie made it sparkle less than the previous installments. In addition, the movie decided to add more characters to an already loaded piece, and many of these have had a reduction in their purpose, place, and involvement that might disappoint fans. Fans of Agnes, Margo, Edith, Lucy, and even Dr. Nefario or Gru's twin brother will be disappointed to know they do very little in this film, with a focus on Gru, Poppy, and Junior, alongside the merchandised Minions. Without this balance or really looming threat, Despicable Me 4 became another example (to me) of a film trying too much in one movie and hoping it sticks.THE VERDICT:
The fourth ""main"" installment continues the trend of a fun movie that is just good for passing the time and enjoying the distractions that movies can have. Gru and his family are still as cute, cuddly, and silly as ever, and they continue to bring the silliness that will have families cracking up and enjoying being together in their adventures. Beautiful animation brings the antics alive with good voice acting, delivering some of that wit and charm well, but always keeping it family-friendly no matter the underlying tones they set. However, this movie has merged the silliness of minions with the charm of Despicable Me, which is charming and fun, but fails to balance both of their strengths leading to a very disorganized plot. The fourth movie spreads the story out too much in an attempt to utilize all the pieces that make the film have less drive or purpose outside of just making you laugh. This is of course okay, but compared to some of the other films in this series, it's sad to see that cleverness and storytelling gone in place of 90 minutes of uber-ridiculous antics. Is it worth a trip to the theater? Absolutely. It's got plenty of spectacle to be in the theater, and a group outing maximizes this film's entertainment value. In regards to my scores, the final scoring is:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0-6.5.",7.0,rgkarim,2024-07-04,10.0,8.0
519182,No summary,"2 out of 5 stars.Despicable Me 4 is bad fourth film in the series that has the beloved fun characters. The humor is a waste with this film. Even the last Minions spin off film was better than this. The plot tries to add more characters. Have the Gru family going on a safe house hideout from a villlain Maxime which Will Farrell voices. The villains motives didnt have much affect with the characters. The plot also seemed a bit wasted as well with its thin story. The humor was also very few laughs in between. Also, the new minions that are turned into superheroes with powers was terrible and forgettable.The animation is colorful and great. The characters are fun.

If it means for Minions next movie i dont think they should put them in this movie. It's a turn off. No moral of story, only lots of dumb, bullies, and the catchy laughing minions.

519182,No summary,"Honestly, this sequel had a strong foundation to be a good one, but fell, literally, short. That's the biggest issue with the movie. It's just too short.A lot of funny and interesting ideas are brought forth to you, promising to be a great spectacle, and then they don't last more than a few minutes each before being completely forgotten for the following one.The two biggest plot points, the super Minions featured in the trailers and the villain himself, don't get enough screen time worth mentioning.It felt as though Illumination ran out of money and had to cut the movie short, turning it into an unfortunate cash grab. Or maybe Universal's shareholders pushed them to quickly release the movie as-is to boost their revenue for the next earnings release.Even with top-notch production quality, the lack of substance only serves to undermine all of it and give viewers reason to stop following the franchise.

The minions continue to be awesome with lots of fun new... modifications. Poppy is another great addition to the cast. There are so many fun and hilarious scenes of a wide variety.For me, the only thing holding this back from being one of my favorite comedies is the character voiced by Will Ferrell. This is odd since he is one of my favorite comedic actors.

The ending makes literally no sense at all. And there's basically an entirely separate movie about the minions built within this movie, and honestly that movie would've been more interesting.

There are lots of elements that go nowhere and have no consequences so character growth is nonexistent even when it tries to show it is. The main character is no longer despicable so the series potential has been dead for a while. Nothing productive happened with any of the characters that is memorable. It's the same quality as the 3rd movie except I thought the ending of this movie was actually kind of nice with a good song and the reunion of all franchise characters. A good Finale to the series but I would be surprised if this is actually the end because of course they wouldn't put making another movie out of the question. If it wasn't for the ending that was shockingly well done, this movie would've been a 2/10 but congrats Illumination you earned an extra point for bringing back some of the old magic unlike the 3rd movie which is dead to me.",2.0,jakebunker,2024-07-03,4.0,6.0
519182,No summary,"I enjoyed Despicable Me 4! It's full of slapstick comedy plus new and old characters. The animation is so high quality it's despicable.In the sixth installment of the Despicable Me franchise, Gru (Steve Carell), Lucy (Kristen Wiig), and the girls welcome a new member to their family, Gru Jr. (Tara Strong), who is set on tormenting his dad. And now, because of a new villain named Maxime Le Mal (Will Ferrell) and his girlfriend (Sofía Vergara), Gru's family is forced to go into hiding and adopt new identities. Will they take Maxime down or will their cover be blown? Watch to find out!This movie is really cute, but there is just a lot going on at once. There are several different subplots and a lot of new characters that are crammed into this 94-minute movie, so some scenes feel a bit random and out of place. Nonetheless, this is a great family movie. Its humor is geared more towards younger audiences, but that being said, I and a lot of adults laughed throughout the entire movie. I adore all of the characters in the franchise dearly, but my favorite is Agnes, voiced by Madison Polan. She is so sweet and lovable and always wants to do the right thing. I also really love the performances from Steve Carell as Gru, Kristen Wiig as Lucy, Miranda Cosgrove as Margo, and Dana Gaier as Edith. Pierre Coffin, as always, is so impressive when voicing the minions (yes, all of them). Will Ferrell as Maxime and Sofía Vergara as Valentina, Maxime's girlfriend, are hilarious and really fit their roles.The film's messages, similar to the previous installments, focus on the importance of family and doing the right thing. Be forewarned that there are some risky behaviors portrayed in this movie that young children shouldn't try to replicate.Despicable Me 4 gets 4 of 5 stars from me and I recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults.

Amidst all this chaos, there are the Minions with their mayhem as few of them get superpowers. How does Gru protect his family from Maxime, forms rest of the story.Catching this early screening today at PVR for an hefty ticket price and a complimentary popcorn, Despicable Me 4 hasn't evolved from it's predecessors. The story is still basic, with multiple subplots and half baked ideas which don't get explored, eventually relying on the Minions gags. There were definitely enough funny moments which I let out a loud laugh once and few other references to popular films but these work only as individual gags. Poppy is a new character with no explanation for her obsession with the Lycée Pas Bon School except she knows a bunch of super villains. A lot could have been done if the focus was on the family alone with Gru and Gru Jr yet to bond as well as the daughters struggle in the new school but the film gets overburdened with other subplots which only deviate from the main story.The whole gag about Minions getting superpowers is again laugh worthy but they offer nothing to the main story. Maxime and Valentina's characters aren't etched out well as their threat is real but they aren't threatening enough. However the final resolve considering the real reason for the conflict between Gru and Maxime was fine.

I thought it was nice movie with funny moments a Pretty good villain and great voice acting and animation the ending is definitely very fun and brought many memories back. I think it's the maybe the 4th or 5th best movie in the minions/despicable me franchise. But a negatives I think it's tied for the worst despicable me movie with number 3 as it doesn't really develop the characters age or anything. A big plus are the minions which I thought were amazing and really funny in this film. Oh and another negative is dr nefario is really a cameo in this movie which really sucked.

1244492,No summary,"'Look Back (2024)' is a mediation on friendship, passion, and art, examining what happens when these elements intersect. It essentially aims to answer the question that plagues all artists: what is it for? Is it driven by ambition? Success? Fame? Is it to tell a deeper truth? To say what can't be said with words? To get what's inside out for all to see? Is it to connect with strangers? To make someone feel less alone? To make someone smile or weep or take a step back and look at their place in the world? Or is it simply to do something you love with someone you love? If so, why do you carry on even when one of those things has gone? The film explores these ideas through the relationship between two girls who grow up together making manga after one of them confesses to being a fan of the other's school newspaper strips. Taking place over a number of years, the picture depicts their evolving relationship with both each other and the art they create, ultimately taking an emotional turn when life inevitably catches up with their ambitions. There's a semi-fantastical element here that could be interpreted one of two ways, and interestingly I prefer the more literal version than the metaphorical one (which is tend to lean towards). Either way there's a lot of thematic resonance to be found here, and it's unsurprising that it's connecting so deeply with so many people.Clocking in at just under an hour, the piece doesn't waste any time. It sort of feels like a long short film, but it's actually a short long film (it's over the minimum length to be classed as a feature). In some ways, it feels like it could have been expanded by twenty minutes; in other ways, it's exactly as long as it needs to be. It's a focused experience that mimics the insular nature of the central dynamic, as the two leads are the only important people to us just as they seem to be the only important people to each other. The animation sometimes seems slightly rough, in that it isn't consistently refined and some movements don't quite keep things on model, but it also includes several scenes that must have been really tricky to pull off because they include sweeping camera moves and changing perspectives. I can't tell if the animators used 3D models and custom shaders for these scenes or if they, much more painstakingly, animated everything in 2D; either way, if I can't tell, it's equally as impressive. There's a meta element to the movie, too, because it's based on a manga that's about producing a manga (obviously the meta aspects are watered down somewhat by the adaptation process, but the parallels between the film and its subject are still strong nevertheless). This makes each and every frame, as well as the time and effort that's gone into it, all the more relevant, and it's a perfect example of a film's form enhancing its content.Ultimately, this is a moving and engaging anime that doesn't waste a moment in conveying its story and themes. Its a gentle, bittersweet experience that's both devastating and life-affirming, and it feels as though it grasps at a deeper truth about artists and their work. Its a strong effort.",7.0,Pjtaylor-96-138044,2024-11-17,0.0,0.0

1244492,No summary,"'Live for your goals, invest in your plans, turn work into a passion, give your all for your vision.' That's clever advice from mostly happy-go-lucky beaurocrats. Most people will know that a lot of effort doesn't necessarily lead to the goal. And what goal is the goal anyway? In real life, success also involves a lot of fateful coincidences. And, as already mentioned, this is entirely a matter of opinion. Fujino and Kyomoto go from being on the side to friends to business partners, find each other, lose each other, find each other again and are finally separated. Look Back is one of those anime that manages to depict big life within its small setting. How small moments can have a big impact, how a touch can trigger a far-reaching coincidence. In its entirety, it was an enjoyable hour for me, but the obvious attempt at an emotional touch only worked for me to a limited extent. Perhaps I was also unable to connect with the theme of girl-friendship, which, alongside the philosophical themes, takes centre stage.",7.0,xnicofingerx,2024-11-15,4.0,3.0

However, it turned out to be disappointing in the end.You can't make me get attached to the characters and make me love or hate them, and engage with them in an hour or less. This is what made the characters feel strange, and their situations were not clear. Additionally, the writer's insistence on making me feel sadness at the end of the film made me feel disgusted; everything was inconsistent.The story has many gaps, one of which is making the characters fight at the end because one of them wants to go to college while the other wants to continue her career. The first one scolds the second and cuts ties with her, even though they succeeded and grew up together. Blaming the first girl was not justified at all.Chaos, chaos, chaos - this is the best way to describe this work.

1244492,No summary,"This is about life, death and life. Fujimoto is a great contemporary writer in the manga scene known for Chainsaw Man - gory and heavily handed on social commentary. This work is truly a gem and also boasts the depth in writing. It's a very simple yet very deep piece that feels very calculated and precise in it's form and message.A little background might help us understand where this manga came from and what it wants to come across. In 2019, there was an arson attack on the famous Kyoto Animation that killed many many brilliants artists. This left everybody in shock about everything in the community. This manga(2021)/movie(2024) uses this tragic event to ponder about life, work (anime and manga industry) and hardships.It's not a coincidence that both characters came from the author's name: Fuji(no) and (Kyo)moto. They're both part of Fujimoto's sense of self: the shut-in genius persona and the social energetic persona. Having this two sides working together is what Fujimoto thinks as a point where success comes from. But, when faced with a great real tragedy, the real-life genius side also takes a hit (i guess). So Fujimoto writes away finding a path to go on making art.What makes this an effective work of art is how anyone can relate to this feeling. A heartfelt breakup, something that you worked so hard and failed, death, etc. There are many thing in life that makes you look back on past events and than you find a way to get back on your feet to live life again!My heart goes to all the manga/anime industry community that went through this tragedy.

1244492,No summary,"Look Back, a one-shot manga adapted by director Kiyotaka Oshiyama from Tatsuki Fujimoto's work, tells the emotionally resonant story of two young artists, Fujino and Kyomoto. Though polar opposites-Fujino is an ambitious, audience-driven creator, while Kyomoto is an introspective perfectionist-they represent complementary aspects of the artistic journey, illustrating themes of drive, validation, and self-expression.The film's animation style diverges from typical dynamic anime, embracing a live-action-like restraint that lets scenes unfold slowly, allowing viewers to feel both the passion and strain of creation. This reserved approach draws viewers into the nuanced emotions of the characters, transforming even the smallest gestures into powerful moments. The relationship between the two girls evolves with quiet respect and understanding, rather than competition, making their bond deeply affecting.A sudden tragedy disrupts the narrative, giving the story a meditative existential layer. It underscores Fujimoto's exploration of art as a fragile attempt to capture fleeting moments and preserve memories. This melancholy is mirrored in the film's hand-drawn, sketch-like visuals, which capture the imperfection and intensity of the creative process. Haruka Nakamura's score amplifies these emotions, making the experience feel almost tactile, as if viewers could sense the weariness, persistence, and yearning in each scene.Ultimately, Look Back is both a tribute to artistic creation and a reflection on the reasons we make art. It probes whether we create for recognition or simply for the beauty of it, offering no answers but inviting viewers to look inward. Through the delicate, evocative journey of Fujino and Kyomoto, the story suggests that, sometimes, looking back is part of moving forward.",8.0,adamwarlock-13263,2024-11-09,1.0,4.0

He manages to make it big while staying in a very small world, if that makes sense.Art style 7/10The art style is faithul to the source. A couple transitions felt ""3D"", which took me out for a second, but nothing too major.Music 10/10I was positively surprised.

I think it really elevated a couple of scenes.Conclusion 9/10Fujimotos asks important questions - big ones and small ones. He does not answer them, but he shows us the emotions. Should we push others, or is it safer to not get involved? Why are we doing the stuff that we do?

From the close up shots of faces to the long environmental scenes the animators did great. I especially liked that whenever a character looked stressed or angered, it looked genuine. The amount of detail in this movie is phenominal. I hope that the animation team continues to work closely with Fujimoto's works because they did exceptional.Another reason why this film is so great is because of the wonderful soundtrack done by. Haruka Nakamura. Every single time music is used, it serves a purpose and adds an extra oomph to the scene. Music is so integral to the story, I cannot stress this enough. The lack of music also helps add a natural feeling to scenes. Overall, with music or without music. Both elevate scenes to an insane level and without either the movie would not be as good as it is.The final, yet most important thing to talk about, is the story. Since this is spoiler free I will try to be as vague as possible because I highly encourage everyone to go watch the movie. This story hits you from all angles, no matter where you're from, the message remains loud and clear to anyone. Once you understand it, it really makes you cry. Fujimoto is an artist in not only art but also story. He paints a beautiful story combining tragedy and comedy to an insane level that many have never reached.

1244492,No summary,"""If you just follow me, everything will go smoothly.""Absolutely heart-wrenching film about two aspiring female mangaka that is accomplished through a lot of visual creativity and excellent editing. It may be less than an hour long but it's all killer and no filler. The theme of friendship is also fuelled by competition, jealousy, and guilt on Fujino's side. The first time we see Fujino, we see her back, and her foot impatiently tapping away while also being quite tired after drawing the 4-panel manga strip for the school's newspaper. We only see her face in the reflection of a mirror on a table, and her clothing is gender ambiguous, which caused me to mistake her for a boy until her voice comes out. You only notice she's a girl when there's a zoom out to her clothes at school much later. She gets bigged up hard at school where everyone praises her First Kiss sci-fi romance strip, and it's clear she cares a lot about external validation. This comes crashing down when a rival to her comic strip also shows up in the newspaper, from truant student Kyomoto who stays at home because she's scared of people (hence why her art is of backgrounds such as buildings). There is a scene where Fujino is walking across a field, cross-cut with comments from others praising Kyomoto's strip and now Fujino's art is seen as ""average"" in comparison. Fujino is asked by a teacher to take this younger girl under her wing. Fujino develops an obsession over a whole year to be better, incurring social and education costs. She then quits, and only until she finally visits Kyomoto to deliver a graduation certificate and gets fangirl'ed, also seeing they both stacks of drawing notebooks piled up, does her interest in being a mangaka get reignited. They both improve each other in ways, such as encouraging Kyomoto to get out of the house and meet people, become less shy, and travel together. From here a strong and bittersweet friendship grows.Kiyotaka Oshiyama's character designs, screenplay, and direction along with the rest of the team deliver a phenomenal audiovisual adaptation of Tatsuki Fujimoto's manga, that has to be seen at a cinema. The animation is amazing throughout, with some variety in art styles, and one section of the First Kiss manga strip reminding of Masaaki Yuasa's simpler and wacky style. Fujino's character arc from overly confident and arrogant to more social and collaborative with Kyomoto is beautiful to see, which is why when Kyo doesn't decide to stick with her to become a manga series artist and wants to go to art university instead regresses Fujino back to a more guilt-tripping and mean side. The form of manga itself is playful and magically realist towards the final stretch. I was drawn to tears towards the last 20 minutes, especially when there is a montage of stills as they draw and hang out together. The ending is one of the saddest for any film this year.

Then one afternoon her teacher asks her if she wouldn't mind letting ""Kyomoto"" have a go. She's never at school - indeed she's routinely called the truant, but he thinks that this might be a way of getting her more involved. How good can she be, thinks ""Fujino""? Well it turns out that she's actually pretty good - but she still never shows up. At graduation time, ""Fujino"" is tasked with delivering the certificate to her unknown rival and that's the start of something that neither girl could readily have anticipated. It's quite an emotionally powerful animation, this one, taking a look at ambition and isolation amongst young people craving for acceptance, purpose and friendship as they start to emerge from childhood and face a much less sympathetic world. The girls have synergies and differences - at times they act as one, at others - well, anything but - and as the short story develops and the timelines shift about a little, we get to know a little of the enigmatic nature of their personalities and just what makes these girls tick. There is a lot of information on the screen - even if you do understand Japanese, and though I'm usually loathe to recommend dubbed versions, it might make it slightly easier to follow if you are not trying to read the top and the bottom of the screen at the same time as watching the simply effective animation.

1244492,No summary,"Look Back tells the story of two young girls, namely Fujino(Yumi Kawai) & Kyomoto(Mizuki Yoshida). Fujino is extremely confident & Kyomoto is very shy & doesn't leave her house. Their personalities are like chalk & cheese. However, their love for sketching manga, make Fujino & Kyomoto bond.Look Back is a mesmerizing film. Writer-director Kiyotaka Oshiyama has given us a movie that will make you laugh, remind you of your precious childhood days & by the end, you'll be bawling like an infant. The animation is awe-inspiringly gorgeous. The story based on the manga by Tatsuki Fujimoto, is the highlight of this anime adaptation. The vocal performances are brilliant. Yumi Kawai is mind-blowing as Fujino. Mizuki Yoshida is phenomenal as Kyomoto. The supporting cast is memorable. Look Back is a must watch for anime fans & pretty much everyone else. It's feel-good & heartbreaking at the same time. Please watch it on the big screen if you get the chance & I promise you won't regret it!",10.0,Anurag-Shetty,2024-10-29,4.0,3.0
1244492,No summary,"Giving this an 8.5/10 ratingMost likely the shortest film this year, but you get so much in the short time, it's just spot on great. Based on the manga of the same name written by Tatsuki Fujimoto, the story is just based around two characters and how their love of art affects them.This film is just so very watchable, both the leads are relatable and written well as you get pulled in, very quickly. And well acted for such a intense film, thanks to actors Yumi Kawai and Mizuki Yoshida, who had to work, and work good they did. Kiyotaka Oshiyama is writer and director here, and I must say, it's a standout picture, moods are set, days and night are defining moments in time, so much so due to the run time and some very clever design work.The music and songs work perfectly, it's very light and bittersweet, I have seen this twice and will see it again in cinemas, A master class in story telling.",8.0,donmurray29,2024-10-26,5.0,3.0

1244492,No summary,"Fujino was the leading manga creator for her school until Kyomoto, the class recluse, entered the scene. From then on, they grew together and pushed each other to improve themselves and achieve their dreams. They were on top of the manga game until Kyomoto decided to branch off and go at it alone. They continued to do what they loved until tragedy struck, forcing Fujino to reevaluate her circumstances.This is a beautiful anime film about how people can find a friend in the most unlikely of places and how that person can push them to greatness. The story is simple but uses the full range of human emotion. The animation changes as the story progresses, giving the film a unique look. With a runtime of fifty-eight minutes, the story is not rushed. It focuses on the significant parts of Fujino and Kyomoto's story.

1244492,No summary,"Look back is a beautiful adaption not only in the animation sense which had a charm I've grown to recognize and love that gets it right consistently with facial animations that are perfect for conveying a wide range of real emotions, to the standout scene of Fujino prancing through the rain. But beautiful also in the sense of the deeper meaning, written as almost a love letter to creators and the creative process of what it truly takes to make something great. I also loved the contrast between Fujino and Kyomoto, very much the introvert vs extrovert characteristics many of us see in our own relationships, ""Thank you for brining me out of my room"" very heartful. My two missing stars are due to a shorten then desirable runtime at under and hour which could has easily stretched to 90 minutes.

1244492,No summary,"The Look Back anime movie does an exceptional job of adapting the amazing manga short story into animation, bringing it to life with added layers of depth that only this medium can provide. The film skillfully uses animation, voice acting and music to heighten the emotional impact of the story. The atmosphere created by the soundtrack and the heartfelt performances of the voice actors enriches the narrative, making it even more profound.A special mention goes to Fujino's voice actor, who was a first-time performer, yet delivered a remarkable performance. It's impressive how well she captured Fujino's energy and emotion, despite being new to the craft. Kyomoto's voice actor also deserves high praise for perfectly portraying a character who is so inexperienced with human interaction and shy. The subtlety and depth in the way these two characters are brought to life is one of the movie's strongest aspects.At its core, Look Back is a love letter to creators, celebrating the passion, challenges, and personal growth that come with the artistic journey. But the film also balances this theme with a genuine, heartfelt relationship between Fujino and Kyomoto, making their bond feel real and deeply touching. This balance between creativity and emotional connection makes the movie a must-watch for not only fans of the original manga but anyone who appreciates stories about art, friendship, and the human spirit.",9.0,Camerenth,2024-10-07,33.0,5.0
1244492,No summary,"The structure of the movie isn't fully complicated but it's seriously welcoming. I loved every second of it, even though the animation isn't top tier, which leads to me on a little rant on another director's work:My lone criticism on most of Makoto Shinkai's work is that there is too much filler and everything is wrapped up like a neat little bow, even his shorter movies. You learn many things in his works but you rarely get a glimpse on the true meaning of his works. Or at least I have a hard time connecting the themes of his works/fully loving his stories. Weathering with You for example, has a lot packed in, from child abandonment to homelessness to....grief....to environmental concerns. Very important topics, but those things are placed in weird ends of the story. Like *spoiler* the gun shooting sequence. A sudden plot turn which changes the whole tone of the movie. I don't want to make this into a flack piece. He will always be one of the greatest anime creators, and I do love Suzume and The Garden of Words, but he adds unnecessary filler and this film is the perfect contrast: doing much more with much less.While this one shot, it ""could've"" used ""more"". It ""could've"" had more cute scenes and somber moments. But like our memories, we always remember the highest of highs and lowest of lows. Plus it's made by a creator really trying to process it all during grief. I wish I remember every, single, conversation; I wish I could've written down every moment I looked at my mother in the years before she died, but I have repressed so much and I sadly do remember only the lows and highs and no in betweens. It's life. These people you love you really do naturally love. So appreciate each time you are around the people you love because those memories could fade.Overall, it's an excellent film and I hope the people that avoid it because of the short run time don't dismiss it. I'm not a Chainsaw-Man fan but I have appreciated this greatly and respect the creator even more.",10.0,jfgemini,2024-10-07,12.0,7.0

1244492,No summary,"Tatsuki Fujimoto's ""Look Back"" was a fantastic manga which offered a deeply introspective and thought-provoking look into the mind of the artist himself - a self-reflection on his journey to becoming a successful manga artist, from creating short stories as a kid to writing one of Jump's latest big hits. This adaptation introduces us to Fujino and Kyomoto, two talented and passionate girls who expertly represent the internal ideological debate regarding the very essence of creating art and pursuing goals. Simultaneously, the film tells an emotional tale of the bond between these young artists - although going into detail would involve major spoilers, due to the multitude of heart-shattering twists and turns in just 60 short minutes of runtime.As a story about art and passion, it is only natural that the film's production would mirror these qualities expertly. Kiyotaka Oshiyama is one of the most interesting creatives in Japan's animation industry, and, so far, this is certainly his greatest work. With a relatively small team, he has managed to craft one of the most visually appealing pieces of animation I've ever seen - single-handedly producing, directing, screenwriting, designing, storyboarding and supervising - and animating absurd portions of the film. Breathtaking work, and inkeeping with the message of Fujimoto's brilliant story.For bonus points: Haruka Nakamura's soundtrack is amazing, especially the main theme ""Light song"".Look Back perhaps may not become a mainstream hit, but will certainly be remembered by those who watched it as a heartfelt, emotional, beautifully-crafted film with an incredible attention to detail.10/10, without a doubt.

Also surprising was the level of detail, compared to other ""lost in the woods"" movies. So ""easy"" to make ""lost in the woods"" movies... but to include a science angle, and bunkers, as well as somewhat lofty elements from myths, was also very unexpected, but exiremely appreciated. The film has many ENDS... and just when you think ""ok, this MUST be it""... There's MORE. To a fine excess. Its got its ""slow"" parts, and I can understand some reviewers may have found those moments ""dull""... but they set the scene, for a more immersive plot, and give the viewers a taste of being stuck somewhere. I'd compare this to ""Invasion of the Body Snatches"" meets ""The Ritual"". Elements also took me to computer games like ""Metro"" and ""FarCry"" with shadows of underground critters, tunnels and bunkers.

The sylvan setting looks amazing, but as soon as they enter the concrete building (how did they build that ? Where do they even get water or urinate and defacate ?) I sort of lost interest. It felt like I was suddenly watching some post-apocalyp[tic sci-fi movie.The characters never really interested me and many of their choices never really made much sense.

But the big flaw of this film is that it tries to have a complex and inspired plot and then fails terribly because it is managed very badly and this is truly terrible because as an atmosphere the film is beautiful and as for tension scenes it manages to entertain well, then you look at the plot that seems particular and cute and instead it is managed so badly that it makes you despise it.",6.0,gianmarcoronconi,2024-11-17,0.0,0.0

1086747,No summary,"The Watchers is a film deeply influenced by gothic and fantastic traditions, merging these genres with Slavic mythological elements to create an internal universe that reflects a theme of female darkness, possibly lost or hidden. The character dynamics mirror those found in Dracula with characters named Mina and Lucy, referencing the duality of femininity-Mina represents the moral, restrained woman, while Lucy embodies passionate, unrestrained darkness.The film also explores themes of identity and duality, drawing on the rich tradition of Slavic mythology, where female figures, often connected to death, the underworld, and transformation, play central roles. This includes deities like Kali, Persephone, and Rusalka, all of whom embody liminal spaces between life and death, similar to the vampire mythos.The narrative weaves these ideas through the conflict of human-fairy wars and the notion of transcendent beings whose powers are cut off from the world, much like the fate of the fairies. The film follows the story of Mina discovering Madeleine's divine, hybrid nature, leading to the ""awakening"" of her wings, both literally and symbolically, and the reconciliation between the two characters.The film's characters, particularly Madeleine, resonate with the figure of Baba Yaga from Slavic folklore-an old, ambiguous figure who straddles light and dark, life and death, further emphasizing the thematic connection to transformation and the cycles of life, death, and rebirth.In its exploration of these complex themes, The Watchers reflects on the return of a lost, transcendent power through the female experience, portraying a journey of self-realization and reconciliation, with a darker, yet ultimately hopeful resolution.",8.0,m-sileo,2024-11-13,0.0,0.0
1086747,No summary,"I will admit that I have not read the book (but now I want to) and only had the vaguest inkling of the plot from seeing a preview. But, as a fan of mythology and lore, I really appreciated the unique take on the classic Celtic myths of changelings.Were there plot holes? Yes. I'm not going to relay them here in order to avoid spoilers, but they were enough to rate the movie 7/10 rather than 8 or 9.I don't think any of the actors/characters were wooden. Mina (Fanning) was a traumatized young woman who was doing everything she could to numb the pain and guilt she was running away from. Over the course of the movie we find out that nearly all of the captives have traumatic pasts, so their seemingly erratic and irrational reactions/ behaviors aren't inexplicable to anyone familiar with PTSD.If you haven't read the book and don't have ANY expectations about the story (or director) going in, you'll probably enjoy this movie (provided you have an interest in supernatural horror/ thrillers).

It's simple and concise, leaving the viewer with things to imagine, which I liked. In fact, the last few minutes were, in my opinion, the best part of the film.

Night Shyamalan's latest disaster, ""Trap"" (that one was by far the worst movie I've seen this year).I just loved the folklore it's based on, and as apparently the book by A. M.

1086747,No summary,"The Watcher was marketed to me on every social media platform this summer, but come fall, I've heard nothing about this film. It was advertised as a suspenseful sci-fi horror movie trope but after two watches revealed itself to be dark fantasy that makes you think. I appreciate that the film did not rely on gore or jump scares for edge, but rather on story development and plot twists.This movie is directed by Ishana Night Shyamalan, the daughter of renowned filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan. This cinematic lineage showed itself in very exciting ways. I really enjoyed the homage she paid to her father's style of layered plot twists. It's a good way to build her credibility in his shadow before she can go off on her own and make other culturally rich films without the pressure of living up to his name.Speaking of culturally rich films, I found it fascinating that she used international folklore and the historical context that comes with Irish tales to build her story rather than Western horror tropes. The unfamiliarity with this topic made it hard to guess what was coming next and didn't make the supernatural elements feel forced.Overall, Ishana proved herself capable of complex storylines that sustain tension and give simmering conclusions. It was a new form of psychological thriller that I think was too hard for mainstream media to digest and make headlines about.

The pacing was all over the place, and the predictable ending didn't help.

When you work with so little characters all stuck in a room for most of the movie you need to write more interesting ones and with more dynamic than what we had here. It always felt like an odd bunch. And this is part to blame with the lead character and her story. Which is shallow and teethers too long on it's melancholy whilst not providing anything else or deeper looks into the psych besides a very basic trauma, besides that it doesn't go far enough.

It has some beautifully framed moments and the deep forest sets were eery. But as it went on, it started to feel a little.....forced? I dunno.To be perfectly blunt, this movie treats its audience like they are dumb. It literally explains everything that is happening like the audience couldnt infer or deduce based on the events as they unfold. Maybe it was studio interference thinking audiences wouldnt get it? Again, hard to say, but this movie came off like it was for viewers that have completely turned off their brains and dont have any critical thinking or deductive reasoning to exercise.The acting/writing was a little stiff too and not quite sure the chemistry amongst the actors worked.It does have a hard twist about 2/3 of the way through - this was directed by Ishana Shyamalan, M. Night's daughter (the sixth sense, signs, split, etc) - so it nods to some of his previous work, twists, and his style of directing. But with that said, once the twist drops, it struggles to regain its footing and maintain the same level of suspense and novelty.Would i reco? Eeeeeehhhhhhh, very soft maybe, but im going to lean towards no.

It mostly takes place in a man made forest planted with sitka spruces and those trees are not even native to Ireland so the realistic atmosphere is destroyd there. If it just were filmed in an old beech or oak forest it would make more sence for me, but ironically Ireland actully is one of the EU countries which has the most poor aumont of forests so also this thing that its so big that they cant reach the end of it and not get out is kind of ridicilous in my point of view as I have actully been in that area myself and its harder to find dense forest than open land.So even if there are an old local folklore about it, its not really the best place for it to be told at all couse there are a lot of other countries with similar folklores and so much better locations with for it that actully would make more sence to a story like this.",2.0,johanrylander,2024-10-12,1.0,1.0

1086747,No summary,"Well, we are apparently in the minority but I am one of those who found it quite a bit of
I actually found the staging rather brilliant as well as the interpretation of ""Dakota Fleming"" and the very beautiful photography. We can notice how much there is a big difference between the tones used for the forest with always dark, dreary colors that accentuate the impression of insecurity, terror and constant danger and those inside the shelter, warm colors, mainly orange, giving an opposite feeling of comfort and protection), Good work that makes us feel different, very contrasting sensations.And then the filmmaker chooses not to show us the famous lookouts of the forest until the last part, which gives us a feeling of very intense intrigue. We appreciate that the terror used is mainly psychological and that she knows how to play with shadows, sound, elements and the magic of the script rather than with jump scares.It is also possible that beyond the macabre fairy tale, these characters, who neither eat nor drink throughout the film, are simply a kind of symbolic resource to talk more deeply about the protagonist, her guilt and her trauma and the mythology invoked a metaphor.This way of seeing the film would explain the apparent inconsistencies...
The truth is that with The Watchers we find a product very much made in Shyamalan, a film with touches of psychological horror, thriller and quite a bit of fantasy and of course those final twists so typical of the director. Ishana reminds me of the young ""Brandon Cronenberg"" who borrows a lot from his father in his works.A psychological horror film that knows very well how to use Irish folklore to enhance an interesting scenario.",7.0,herimesquida,2024-10-05,1.0,1.0

It could have been better, for a directors first film, I hope it was a learning experience. The beginning of the film created an intriguing mystery, but once the film started introducing characters and themes the movie felt like it spread itself too thin. The CGI was laughably bad at times (one towards the end with glass shattering was laughable). And the cinematography left a lot to be desired.

1086747,No summary,"Watching The Watchers is a supernatural thriller directed by Ishana Night Shyamalan, daughter of M. Night Shyamalan, who has worked on the sets of Servant, Old, and Knock at the Cabin. The film, adapted from a novel by A. M. Shine, takes place in a magical Irish forest, a Bermuda Triangle of land that appears on no map. The film follows a quartet of strangers, known as The Coop, who are observed each night by a two-way mirror. Shyamalan effectively explains the dilemma, but the more detail-oriented may get stuck on unanswered questions. The film features Mina (Dakota Fanning), an artist with a birdcage, sketchbook, and genre-mandated family baggage. She is joined by Daniel (Oliver Finnegan), Kira (Georgina Campbell), and Madeline (Olwen Fouéré), the eldest of the captives. Madeline upholds the rules laid down by the unseen Watchers, such as never being outdoors after nightfall, poking around the deep burrows from which the Peeping Toms emerge, and never turning your back on the mirror. The film's exposition is effectively conveyed through the mouth of an actor with some presence and gravitas, like Fouéré, who delivers the exposition with some presence and gravitas. The Watchers is a suspenseful and intriguing film that combines elements of M. Night's The Village and the mystery-laced YA sensation The Maze Runner. The film's suspense and intrigue are evident as Ishana keeps the audience in the dark, allowing them to catch glimpses of what's lurking in the shadows. However, the film doesn't hold up to scrutiny and its pleasures are mostly in the delaying of revelations, not in their uncovering. The plot is dense with improbabilities and shaky motivations, which could be interpreted as an allegorical reading. The Coop, a small television set equipped with DVD episodes of a close-quarters reality show called Lair of Love, serves as an entertaining two-way mirror, offering an unseen audience a nightly window into the lives of four strangers. The Watchers ultimately has more mythology than genuine drama, with its pressure-cooker scenario never simmering into a satisfying war of wills. The wilderness convicts are closer to stick figures than multi-dimensional people, and the heroine's grief over a dead parent mirrors the parental anxieties the elder Shyamalan has increasingly foregrounded. Fanning, who acted mostly through the eyes, demonstrates her skill in acting through the eyes, a skill she first exhibited in War of the Worlds. The Watchers is a puzzle thriller that focuses on the mystery of a group of strangers imprisoned by unseen woodland observers. The director, Ishana Night Shyamalan, has a promising vision for her first feature, but lacks the formal prowess of her father. The movie offers glimmers of real craft and intrigue, but the big picture may make viewers want to scatter the pieces again. Shyamalan has absorbed lessons about suspense and atmosphere from her time on the sets of similar movies like Knock at the Cabin. However, as The Watchers comes together, it becomes less interesting and is best left unsolved.",6.0,moviesfilmsreviewsinc,2024-10-01,1.0,1.0

Was just fun to see the mysteries of the magical forrest unfold.I also really enjoyed the exploration of pre-written northern European mythology.

It had similarities to The Village while also having a unique premise.Overall I mostly enjoyed this flick even though there are a couple of flaws. For example the dialogue is at times really bad and to give the viewer exposition by having the main character talk to her parrot was lazy. Also there are quite a few things that don't make much sense in terms of how these people survived for that long in this Bunker. There are other minor flaws but overall I think the movie mostly delivered. It's stayed true to his promise and there were multiple tension-filled scenes. It's not a particularly scary movie but there was a certain creep-factor within. The Casting was well done anti-actors delivered pretty solid performances especially with Olwen Fouéré having a very fitting role in this. At some point I thought the movie was over but there was still almost 30 minutes left and we entry the third act which was rather unnecessary in my opinion.

But the Maine issues with this movie is the story itself and the characters. Mina's past of getting her mother killed ultimately leads to nothing. Ciara and Daniel being unnecessary characters that add nothing to the movie. Not to mention Daniel being extremely stupid and his actions make no sense. Lastly, Madeline, who's only role is knowing exactly what to do and not to do with her rules. All four of these actors in this movie did a terrible job acting too. By the end of the movie, I didn't care about any one of these characters or their outcomes. The climax of this movie, where Mina is talking to Madeline about ""knowing what it feels to not belong"" and the final attempt to wrap her past and with Madeline and bring out any emotion from the audience generally made me laugh out loud.

1086747,No summary,"From earlier this year, the second M. Night Shyamalan film (this one from M's daughter Ishana Night, who scripted here from a novel by A. M. Shine) which finds poor Dakota Fanning, a US transplant working at a pet store in Ireland, who gets an assignment to deliver a parrot to a customer where she finds herself broken down in the middle of a forest. Taking her parrot she finds a structure where a trio of occupants; Georgina Campbell, Olwen Fouere & Oliver Finnegan who explain she's joined them to be trapped at the mercy of some nocturnal creatures who study them like pets in a cage while during the day they have the run of the area which has a fenced in perimeter. Throughout the course of the narrative Fanning tries to convince the others to flee, even though Fouere, a college professor, seems to know more about their captors than she's letting on & continually dissuades them from doing so. Finally fleeing into a bunker beneath the structure after the creatures attack enmasse, recordings are discovered made by the site's creator, John Hannah, who says the area is infested by fairies who after falling into obscurity by humans disbelief in them are now plotting a way to come back w/a vengeance. Shyamalan, taking a hefty page from her dad, infuses her debut w/some Hitchcockian touches, Fanning, a blonde, taking the parrot to its buyer smacks of Tippi Hendren's initial gambit to Bodega Bay in The Birds & when the film doesn't play an obvious game of exposition dump, some of the atmosphere works but some trimming here & there may've made the film more effective but there is talent running through those Shyamalan veins.",6.0,masonfisk,2024-09-21,0.0,0.0

The script required more polish, the editing needed to be tighter, and the pacing fails to keep tedium at bay.

I love creature features so I was excited to check it out, especially as I'm a fan of Dakota Fanning and Olwen Fouéré (Tarot, Sea Fever, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Northman, Mandy).I was expecting a straight up creature feature. Monsters in the woods maybe. Possibly aliens with the whole people in a box being observed kind of theme. It definitely is a people being observed film and there are 'monsters' but it is so much more than that by the end of the film.I really don't want to give spoilers, but I'll say that the ending left me (a horror fantasy fan) happy to have a film that deviated from the usual genre themes. Is it a great cinematic masterpiece? No. Is it an entertaining, satisfying film that I will most likely rewatch? Yes, it is.For a small film with very few actors it is well acted and compelling. The sets are well done and are frightening and give a sense of foreboding and claustrophobia. And the antagonists are genuinely frightening in both idea and appearance. Terrifying in their ferocity and yet sympathetic by the end of the film (No, I'm not explaining!)Overall a fun film that was paced quickly so it doesn't lag at all. Dakota Fanning manages to create a character you care about even as you want to smack her 'rule breaking' attitude for a while. It's nice to actually have a female character fleshed out a bit in such a short (1 hour 42 minutes) fast paced film.Definitely recommended.",9.0,sue-77,2024-09-12,1.0,2.0
1086747,No summary,"08 September 2024, 07:11 PM UTC, and I just watched The Watchers - no pun intended, yet -, a movie by Ishana Night Shyamalan. Sounds familiar? She is the daughter of M. Night Shyamalan, the mind behing The Sixth Sense, that one movie with Bruce Willis, you know? The Watchers is Ishana's directional debut - and the work uses a 2021 novel by A. M. Shine as source, which I have not read.A lot of background information to start a review, but this is important background. We are talking Shyamalan here, and I think this fact has a key factor in this story. We will get there.The story follows Mina, an American woman trying to avoid coming to terms with her past while trying to make a living in Ireland. She is clearly depressed but tries to dismiss the whole situation. Her boss tasks her to transport a golden conure to a zoo, and, en route, she gets estranded on a eerie forest where three strangers ask her to join the Coop to get protection from the Watchers.The previous paragraph is the fast paced opening scene. We are talking a few cuts and we are already at the Coop. The rest of the movie is a mystery about who are the Watchers, what do they want, and, ultimately, how to escape this forest prison.The concept and the premise are pretty, pretty good, honestly. Unsurprisingly, this movie adapts a novel. I have a joke with my wife that deep, interesting movies usually adapts novels or short stories.This movie might make the first entry where this conjecture breaks.The pace of the movie leaves gaps unexplained, interesting gaps that people whatching would expect appropriate definitive answers. Exposition characters try to add rationale to events, though ineffective. When the movie ends, questions arise without good closure.Lucy herself is a complex character with a strong background, one that could have had a stronger connection to the events. Glimpses of inner contlict exist, yet little they have to add to the story. Remove them all and everything would still remain intact.Dakota Fanning is solid, unsurprisingly doing another tormented teen. She is good at these roles - I hope out of pure acting skill.The other characters and actings are also solid enough, but the characters themselves are a bit shallow. Again, too many holes left open.In true Shyamalan fashion, a close-to-the-end curveball to wrap the story, one I'm confident Ishana inherited from her father. Then again, this movie is an adaptation, so not really her idea entirely, but it is funny how that ended up being a coincidence.The ending sets closure to what this review raised multiple times: gaps left open. Maybe that is how the source wraps its story, but Ishana had freedom to change what she wanted, if she had not change anything for that matter.The Watchers looks strong, delivers an interesting premise and overall narrative, but the lack of closure on a number of open questions adds detractors to this horror entry. The cinematic experience is good and the thrill is real, even though the overall story is as deep as a puddle.",5.0,gabriel_sanchez,2024-09-09,0.0,1.0

1086747,No summary,"5.8/10 (Partially Recommend)I had wanted to see this in theatres, but never made it in to see it. I'm glad I didn't cause I was overly impressed with it. Not an exact timeframe, but the first 45-55 minutes was very boring. I wasn't engaged at all and I was regretting putting this film on. I know there needs to be a build-up of sequences for the excitement to come but it felt like things were puttering. The final 45-55 minutes were very much engaging and a lot more enthralling. My heart began to race, I was getting nervous for the outcome, and just overall enjoyed myself a lot more. The ending for me was definitely worth waiting for, but I don't know that it was enough to make me watch this film again. If I do, it would be in a year or so. The actors were alright overall, but until the climax and excitement show up, they don't really give you any reason to feel emotional for their situation. I'm not one for fictional books very often, but the movie did peak my interest to potentially read the book someday.Overall, it's fine, but don't let the boredom consume you. Potentially worth seeing multiple times, but on a scale of once a year. Relatively emotionless, but the climax and ending get your heart going a bit. It barely saves itself by the end, but not enough to escape the 5 zone.That's it for now. Thanks for taking time to read my review.

1086747,No summary,"We kick off in a forest that looks like it's straight out of The Witcher, with Mina crashing in on an already occupied house. So far, nothing too crazy. Except that every night, some weird creatures pop up to creep on the tenants like cosmic stalkers. And suddenly, you're thinking even Sauron's giant eye would seem a little less terrifying.Now, the creatures here? They're not Alien or Stranger Things level. They're more suggested than shown, and it feels like the budget mostly went into lighting up that forest. It's like watching Jaws where the shark never comes out of the shadows-except here, all you get are shadows, and that's about it.Ishana Shyamalan, trying to carry on her father's legacy, trips over the rug (literally, there's a whole rug plot point in this movie). She throws in a few twists, just like her dad, but here it feels more forced than anything else. It's like trying to reheat cold pizza in the microwave-it's lost its charm and flavor.Let's be honest, the cinematography is on point. The shots are polished, and it feels like you're wandering through an enchanted forest straight out of Sleeping Beauty, but with a dark twist. But just because it looks good doesn't mean it's fun. The pace drags, the twists are predictable, and you're more likely to get up for a snack than feel a twinge of suspense.As for the double twist ending... well, it's kind of like waiting for Darth Vader to drop a bombshell, only for him to tell you about the weather on Tatooine instead. You see it coming, raise an eyebrow, and then move on. It's like Ishana took notes from her father but skipped the chapter on ""how to truly surprise your audience.""Les Guetteurs has some cool ideas and sleek visuals, but the script sinks under the weight of its own inconsistencies and laziness. Ishana Shyamalan tries to walk in her father's footsteps but ends up tripping over the roots in the forest. In the end, it's watchable but forgettable.",5.0,OniFR,2024-09-07,1.0,0.0

1086747,No summary,"In the realm of horror cinema, ""The Watchers,"" directed by Ishana Shyamalan, M. Night Shyamalan's daughter, has stirred a considerable amount of anticipation. The film stars Dakota Fanning in a role that places her in the eerie and isolating environment of the woods, where she finds herself inexplicably trapped in a room with three strangers. Together, they are subjected to the unnerving surveillance of the unknown entities known as The Watchers. As showcased in the trailer, the premise promises an eerie and nail-biting experience. Yet, while the movie begins with a gripping sense of horror and intrigue, it ultimately succumbs to a disappointing unraveling. In the true nature of the Shyamalan family, the movie started off as intriguing only to falter as the film progresses. As I like it, the movie has been ""Shyamalanified.""From the get-go, ""The Watchers"" captured the viewers with its compelling and eerie setup. Dakota Fanning delivers a strong performance as her character navigates the disorienting and terrifying circumstances of her entrapment, while also subtly showcasing the internal trauma of her character. The first act was effectively crafted to evoke a deep sense of dread, leveraging the fear of the unknown and the unseen. The concept of being watched by an invisible force taps into primal fears, and the film effectively uses this to build suspense and tension. However, as the narrative progresses, ""The Watchers"" begins to falter. The movie's initial premise of an unseen antagonist, which could have sustained the horror elements, starts to disintegrate. The fear of the unknown, a potential tool in horror storytelling, is gradually replaced by a need to overexplain and demystify the core narrative elements that made the film intriguing in the first place. This shift is where the movie starts to lose its grip on the audience.The film's downfall is reminiscent of the trajectory seen in some of M. Night Shyamalan's works, where an initially captivating premise gives way to a convoluted and unsatisfying resolution. Ishana Shyamalan's direction follows a similar pattern, leading to what I described as a ""Shyamalanified"" horror experience. Much like ""The Watchers"", which began with the promise of exploring deeper themes such as identity, childhood trauma, and the existential fear of being watched, ends up diluting these concepts through excessive exposition and predictable twists. The source material, a book that inspired the film, likely held the potential for a richer and more nuanced exploration of these themes. However, the cinematic adaptation falls short in its execution. The reveal of the ""Unknown"" is handled in a manner that feels lackluster and anti-climactic. Instead of maintaining the enigma and allowing the audience's imagination to fill in the gaps, the movie opts for a straightforward and uninspired explanation. This choice undermines the buildup, resulting in a climax that lacks the intended impact.As the movie delves into the root of what is happening, it becomes bogged down by its own narrative choices. The twists, which are meant to add layers of complexity and intrigue, end up being more of a stronghold than a revelation. The pacing suffers as the story becomes increasingly tedious, weighed down by unnecessary details and over-explanation of the situation. This approach is counterproductive in a horror film, where the power of the unknown and the unexplained often serves to heighten fear and tension. The second and third acts of ""The Watchers"" are particularly problematic. What began as a promising exploration of psychological and existential horror devolves into a cliche-ridden drama. The movie's insistence on stripping away the mystery to lay everything bare robs it of its initial allure. Instead of allowing the audience to grapple with the unsettling ambiguity, the film spoon-feeds answers that are neither satisfying nor compelling. The execution in these latter parts feels like a disservice to the clever idea that the film started with. The narrative, which could have continued to explore the deeper psychological aspects of fear and identity, instead resorts to conventional horror tropes. The result is a film that feels like a missed opportunity-a promising concept that was muddied by an overzealous need to provide concrete answers. It's a crime against the horror cinematic universe. There is nothing wrong with allowing the audience to explore their imagination and letting them create narratives in their head.In summary, ""The Watchers"" is a film that begins with great potential but ultimately fails to deliver on its initial promise. The intriguing premise and strong performances, particularly by Dakota Fanning, are overshadowed by a narrative that loses its way. The fear of the unknown, a powerful element in horror, is squandered and squashed by an overreliance on explanation and predictability. Ishana Shyamalan's direction, while initially effective, falls into the trap of overcomplicating and demystifying the story, leading to a disappointing and lackluster conclusion.For viewers seeking a horror film that maintains its suspense and keeps them on the edge of their seats, ""The Watchers"" may prove to be a letdown. While it has moments of brilliance and a strong beginning, the overall experience is marred by a flawed execution that ultimately makes it a frustrating watch. The film serves as a reminder that sometimes, in horror, less is more, and the power of the unknown should never be underestimated.",4.0,jaysonpajaronvistal,2024-09-06,2.0,2.0

1086747,No summary,"Ishana Shyamalan's ""The Watchers"" is a bewildering disaster that fails spectacularly in every department. If you were hoping for a gripping thriller or even a mildly engaging film, prepare to be sorely disappointed. This movie is less of a watchable experience and more of a glaring testament to wasted potential.Let's start with the plot, which is a confounding mess of half-baked ideas and mind-numbing predictability. The story tries to juggle suspense and intrigue but ends up as an incoherent jumble of cliché-ridden nonsense. It's as though Shyamalan threw every thriller trope into a blender, hit 'puree,' and served us the resulting slop, making it feel like a tedious slog rather than an engaging narrative.The dialogue is equally abysmal. Characters speak in stilted, awkward exchanges that are meant to convey tension but instead come off as painfully contrived. It's clear that Shyamalan attempted to craft moments of dramatic weight, but the result is a series of cringe-worthy lines that do nothing but pull you further out of the experience. The characters themselves are painfully one-dimensional, offering no depth or nuance to invest in.The pacing is another major flaw. The film drags on with a snail's pace, stretching out what little plot there is into an excruciatingly long runtime. Scenes are either overly prolonged or abruptly cut, making it difficult to stay engaged or even understand what's happening. The result is a film that feels interminable and devoid of any meaningful payoff.This film is a dismal failure on almost every front. It's a film that squanders its potential with a disjointed plot, cringe-worthy dialogue, and an overall lack of coherence. The attempts at suspense and atmosphere fall flat, leaving you with nothing but a frustratingly forgettable experience. Ishana Shyamalan has delivered a movie that is neither thrilling nor engaging,its an interesting concept that bombed, making it a prime example of how not to craft a suspenseful thriller.

Dakota Fanning delivers a solid performance as Mina, capturing her fear and determination. The supporting cast, including Georgina Campbell and Olwen Fouéré, also contribute to the film's tense mood.However, ""The Watchers"" falters in its execution.

Night Shyamalan, this type of movies are usually my favorites, and overall, I can say that I enjoyed watching The Watchers and that Ishana had a passable directing debut, clearly under the influence of her father.The story is simple with a very similar mysterious atmosphere as in The Village. Camera that moves in perfection like in series Servant, good book plots that keep viewers guessing, and that forrest at night horror feel makes the majority of this movie. And that's a good thing. What is not good is the ongoing departure from reality, where sometimes the characters behave unreasonably in situations that require more dramatic turns and more human-like reactions. Maybe we could say that this is a case of mediocre acting (something I reluctantly say as I loved Dakota performances in her previous movies), which in the end dropped the film to mediocrity. Also, the denouement at the end reminds me of Stephen King's novels; it is too long-winded, confusing, and as if it exits a horror plot.Overall, I enjoyed the movie so i send support and congratulations to the director, Ishana, with hope for new films with a similar theme.",7.0,missel-p-c,2024-09-02,2.0,2.0

Personally, I think Ishana Night Shymalan did a fantastic job for her directorial debut. To say I loved the movie would be an overstatement, and it's not perfect or mind blowing by any means. However, I do think it stays pretty true to the book.There are a few things that were changed for the movie, but I felt they were mostly minor things that didn't make too much of a difference. The biggest change, which did bother me slightly, was the bird. In the book, the bird has more importance because it always signals when the watchers are near. In the movie, it's just sort of there and adds no significance to the plot.I also felt the movie was lacking in character development a bit. Mina mentions that they've become like a family, but I didn't feel that while watching the movie like I did when I read the book. I think the movie could have benefited from a slightly longer runtime to flesh out the characters and their dynamic a bit more.One other issue I had with the movie was the ending. It wasn't done poorly, but I felt that it was much more suspenseful and creepy in the book. The movie leaves some parts out and it ends up feeling rushed. The movies runtime is 1:41 minutes, but again, I think having it be 2 hours long would have been better.Those are my criticisms, but despite that, I did very much enjoy the movie and thought it stayed very true to the story in the book. Much more than other book to film adaptations I've seen. They even filmed in Ireland, which is where the book/story takes place, as opposed to just filming elsewhere and trying to pass it off as Ireland. I appreciated the authenticity.",8.0,juicebox07,2024-09-01,2.0,2.0
1086747,No summary,"Absolutely stunning visually but lacks a story that's well written. It's obvious M Night has taught his daughter how to put together a movie with perfect cinematography. And some of the shot setup is unique and amazing. There were a few awesome glances at rural Ireland. With that said, it's also obvious that this script was lacking. And that same problem sets up actors to appear like they're going through the motions or less energetic. The signature Shymalan twist was in place, but Act 1 felt rushed and Act 2 was a snoozer.Fanning does well with what she has to do. The bird Darwin was cute and really popped in the teal & orange. I didn't like the side characters as much, mostly due to the way they were written. Madeline's character was way too wordy, and Oliver Finnegan seemed miscast here.

1086747,No summary,"The film was at its best early in the middle, introducing the concept of the Watchers and the one-way glass room the protagonists have to stay in at night. The seemingly random plot elements strung together work because of how seemingly random yet intentional they seem.The concept starts to fall apart once they get deeper and deeper into explaining the meaning behind all these seemingly random plot elements, tying it all together in a way which makes it all come across as rather bland, and likely to prompt a whole lot of questions instead of appreciation for the story and its mystery.Without spoiling, I can just say that when there doubt, whether with regards to character motivations, the purpose of the Watchers, or how certain supernatural things work, the film was genuinely interesting and fun to watch. Once it started to explain everything, the character motivations, the purpose of the Watchers, and the whole backstory involved, it fell flat.As an aside, the inclusion of the conure and it learning to talk felt very heavy-handed, like the most obvious of obvious metaphors short of outright explaining the idea upfront.",6.0,phenomynouss,2024-09-01,4.0,2.0

I don't think she was a good fit for this movie at all. Besides that, the first 2/3 of the movie I thought were well done and I thought it was interesting. Then it got a bit predictable and the twist was just thrown in there quickly. Without spoilers, after the bus scene, the ending just felt campy and predictable.

Cinematography and lighting.

1086747,No summary,"This film had several good things going for it and then some bad ones. Let's start with the good: Irish Celtic mythology, good actors, good sets, good production value.That being said, the story was very predictable, the ending was a missed opportunity being by far the weakest part of the film. The story made little sense. It's not that I got hung up on the details of what the Fae are, it's that they were portrayed both as intelligent creatures and brutal predatory animals. There are a lot of relatively new books that deal with that in a much more consistent and captivating way (see The Call, by. Peadar ó Guilín, for example). And then there are the characters: inconsistent, only fleshed out right before they needed to elicit an emotional response and so on.I can't even say that the direction was bad. I didn't mind it or the editing. So maybe Shyamalan's daughter has what it takes already as a director. It's the story that was the huge letdown, so maybe she's not as good of a writer.Bottom line: the plot and characterization left a lot to be desired, but everything else was OK, film-wise.

It had some great moments-both scary and thrilling. The director definitely nailed the mystery, no doubt about that.2. I liked the main character, and as an actress, she's really talented, if you ask me. She's fantastic and has been ever since Man on Fire (2004). The rest of the cast felt a bit like typical M. Night Shyamalan actors-somewhat unknown, doing an okay job. Nothing that's really memorable though.3. The direction was solid, and I was pleasantly surprised. As I mentioned earlier, she's a lot like her dad. But she still did a good job. For her directorial debut, she handled it really well. As I said, I haven't read the book, but I can imagine (as always) that the movie doesn't do it full justice and probably misses out on a lot from the original story. But for a first-time experience with the story, it was interesting and fun. Some scenes, like in most horror films, were really dumb and silly, but overall, it was very well done.4. The film created an engaging and suspenseful atmosphere, no doubt. I liked the whole setup. You get curious about the older woman right away and feel something for her. I love that it's set in Ireland. Beautiful location.5. The ending-was I disappointed? Well, not really. It was an okay ending. There was a twist, of course. Did it feel right? It was fine. Just fine. Not bad at all. Absolutely not. But maybe it wasn't as well-executed as it could have been. Maybe it was the actors' performances, maybe it was the dialogue. I'm not sure what it was, but I wasn't fully convinced or satisfied. But the idea was great, just not delivered as well as it could have been.6. My final impression is that the movie is better than a lot of people have given it credit for. I'd give it a 6, and considering everything (first film, story, well-made, etc.), maybe even a stronger 6. But I was satisfied. It wasn't a great film, but it was a fun watch.

1086747,No summary,"Ishana Night Shyamalan's The Watchers (2024) is a visually striking and intensely atmospheric horror-thriller movie that based on a novel The Watchers (2021) written by K M Shin. And in this movie director Night Shamalans show us a combine elements of horror, fantasy, psychological tension that showcase this film.The overall story centre about main protagonist Mina who struggle with her pust life. And she tried to overcome. Who becomes stranded in a dense, remote forest in western Ireland. As she searches for a way out, she stumbles upon three mysterious strangers-Ciara (Georgina Campbell), Madeline (Olwen Fouéré), and Daniel (Ruairi O'Connor)-who have been trapped in the forest for years. They are constantly being watched by unseen creatures, forcing them to remain in the confines of their forest prison.In my opinion the film well created suspense and thrilling are mind-blowing. Dakota Fanning delivers a compelling performance as Mina, portraying a mix of vulnerability and determination. Georgina Campbell is equally impressive as Ciara, a character whose fear and desperation are palpable. Ruairi O'Connor brings a quiet intensity to Daniel, while Olwen Fouéré's Madeline adds a layer of mystery and foreboding to the group dynamic.The main part of the movie is ""The Twist"" Where Mina know about the Madeline. Madeline is a wife of professor, But the twist is she is die over the years and that Madeline she shaw in bunker who helps her she is the one one of Watchers. And this is best scene for my angel.Overall, The Watchers (2024) is a haunting and visually captivating film that will appeal to fans of psychological horror and those who appreciate a slow-burn narrative. Ishana Night Shyamalan proves herself as a director with a strong voice, delivering a film that is both chilling and reflective. If you're looking for a horror movie that offers more than just jump scares, The Watchers is definitely worth watching.I will give this movie 7.5 Star Rating ...",7.0,soumensahoo-20852,2024-08-15,1.0,1.0

1086747,No summary,"Written/directed by Ishana Shyamalan, The Watchers feels like many of the terrific psychological thrillers from the late 1990s or early 2000s. It really captures that spooky, ""what is happening here?"" atmosphere. Unfortunately, Shyamalan misinterprets too many plot and character beats for The Watchers to be a great film.For a very basic overview, The Watchers tells the story of Mina (Dakota Fanning), a young woman who finds herself trapped in a seemingly inescapable woods. She stumbles upon the trio of Madeline (Olwen Fouere), Ciara (Georgina Campbell), and Daniel (Oliver Finnegan) who profess knowledge of Watchers-their captors who view them through a one-way mirror every night and make escape impossible. But Mina doesn't necessarily buy the rhetoric sight unseen and begins her own investigations into what exactly might be transpiring.Atmospherically, The Watchers is really solid. The younger Shyamalan pulls you into the mystery of the piece by parceling out interesting reveals and intriguing creatures much like her notoriously similar father. Investment in the characters and overall plot is not the issue here.What happens at a certain point, however, is that The Watchers must of course declare what sort of film it is. Is it a literal film or is it a metaphor film? I won't spoil that declaration here, only to say that once it does declare a direction the necessary character-development needed to support the conclusion is not present. When all is said and done, this is a film draped in plot but one that really relies on the character relationships to work in the end, and I don't think Shyamalan achieves that mixture with much success.Overall, The Watchers is the type of filmmaking I really enjoy but specifically not the best of the thriller genre. It represents a significant achievement for the first-time-behind-the-camera Ishana Shyamalan that can perhaps be built on to achieve even loftier heights in her next go-round.",6.0,zkonedog,2024-07-23,1.0,0.0

Whomever made the trailer did a good job of falsifying the film itself. The last 20 - 30 minutes of the movie is the only action where they are moving, running and talking more.

1086747,No summary,"""The Watchers,"" directed by Ishana Night Shyamalan, attempts to create a mysterious and chilling atmosphere reminiscent of Netflix's ""Lore"" and the acclaimed anthology series ""Black Mirror."" However, the film falls short of its aspirations, failing to maintain the intrigue and suspense established in its first half.The premise is intriguing: a group of strangers, including protagonist Mina (Dakota Fanning), find themselves trapped in a mysterious forest, observed by nocturnal creatures known as the Watchers. The unknown nature of these creatures creates a sense of fear and tension, as both the characters and the audience know very little about them.The first half of the film effectively utilizes this unknown factor, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats as they try to unravel the mystery surrounding the Watchers. The cinematography and sound design contribute to the eerie atmosphere, enhancing the sense of dread and unease.However, as the film progresses, the narrative takes a turn for the worse. The second half fails to capitalize on the initial suspense, opting instead for a more conventional and less effective approach to storytelling. The Watchers are revealed to be less mysterious and more mundane, and the film loses its grip on the audience's attention.The film's tone and narrative style, reminiscent of ""Black Mirror"" and ""Lore,"" are not consistently maintained throughout the film. While the first half shows promise with its mysterious atmosphere and thought-provoking themes, the second half falls flat, leaving the audience with a sense of disappointment.The characters, with the exception of the old lady Madeline (played by Olwen Fouéré), are underdeveloped and lack depth. Their one-dimensional backstories and bland performances do little to engage the audience, especially in a film that should be centered around survival against all odds.Overall, ""The Watchers"" had the potential to be a great thriller but ultimately falls flat due to its inability to maintain the mystery and suspense established in the first half. The film's failure to maintain the tone and narrative style of ""Black Mirror"" and ""Lore"" is a stark reminder that even the most intriguing ideas can crumble under the weight of poor execution. As a result, ""The Watchers"" earns a disappointing 2-star rating.",4.0,popcorncatalyst,2024-07-20,4.0,1.0

Dakota Fanning's acting was good, as usual for her, but, there seemed to be a lack of character development for the other (few) characters, and too much added development -- that really wasn't necessary -- for her. I understand padding run time, but, I've seen better, more effective horror that fell between 60 and 90 minutes.

1086747,No summary,"I think M Night Shaymalan is a mediocre filmmaker. I enjoy some of his films a great deal and always will. However, over all I think he's made as many bad movies as good ones. This he produced with his daughter writing and directing. Not gonna lie, I was a bit turned off by the nepotism. However, Dakota Fanning is a good actor and the trailer was intriguing.This is based on an Irish horror novel, written for the screen by the director. As I haven't read the novel, I'm unsure if I can blame the filmmaker for some of the shortcomings.The acting is good, across the board. Dakota Fanning as the lead (Mina) really carries the movie. But I thought the cast was great and as it's a small one, they really worked off each other well. The cinematography is well done, a lot of great ambience and visual suspense.The story is interesting, though for the first half or maybe 2/3 I had a lot of questions that were sort of pulling at threads. Mina is driving through the vast forest in Ireland and her car breaks down. She gets lost looking for help and is guided to a cabin by a strange woman. She finds out that there are a couple others in the cabin as well and that they cannot leave. If they go outside after dark it means certain death, and they're too far from the edge of the forest for them to escape before the day turns to night. They're trapped and one wall of the cabin is a two way mirror... outside are ""The Watchers"" who are mysterious creatures who observe the humans all night long.It's mostly well done, and the answers to most of the questions I had eventually did come. Though some by clunky exposition. Including a scene with looking at video files on a computer (just like in M Night's ""Split""... not exactly ground breaking). One of my biggest gripes is the complete lack of showing passage of time. They're stuck in this cabin, food is scarce. They must forage and hunt for whatever they can. The only scene they show them eating meat is when one guy kills a crow. Yet none of them look gaunt, scrawny or weak. Some of the characters say they've been there for 6 or 8 months, and they look clean, clean shaven, the women look pretty like their makeup never came off... it's just doesn't sell the experience of desperation and hopelessness it's telling us to believe.But the story is overall interesting and captivating, and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

In this half film, unfortunately, it's already 20 minutes in, and not only that, it's even more nonsensical. The same applies to the performance of all of Dakota Fanning's co-stars. You don't feel like you're in a magical forest, but rather in a sanatorium. Okay, that's probably meant to reflect the mental state of the prisoners of this secret power. However, I too was trapped in a meaningless, uninteresting, unexciting nothingness. Even the question of who or what didn't really get through to me, and that's just a weakness of the production. The self-proclaimed surprise - I don't even want to talk about a twist here - was also rather lame. An annoying film? No, one that simply doesn't trigger anything. Another thing about the basic classification: I would call this a mystery thriller, not so much a horror film. It's also Shyamalan style.

It was screen-written and directed by Ishana Night Shyamalan, and is entirely similar to the low budget, low scary films her father, M Night Shyamalan used to put out.There's very little substance to the film even though I think the story would have been a brilliant book.

When she returns, she does not find her car anymore and enters the forest completely lost. When the night is coming, a strange woman, Madeline (Olwen Fouéré), asks her to run to her house called ""The Coop"", otherwise she will die. Mina meets Ciara (Georgina Campbell), whose husband John (Alistair Brammer) is looking for help trying to leave the forest, and Daniel (Oliver Finnegan) that are stranded in the forest for a long time. Georgina explains rules that must be followed by Mina and tells her that the beings ""The Watchers"" observe them though a mirrored glass in the bunker and kill anyone that leaves the bunker during the night. But Mina breaks one rule with the support of Daniel and enters in an underground tunnel, irritating the Watchers. Some time later, Mina learns from Madeline that the Watchers are Fairies trying to learn how shapeshift to imitate humans. When they break in the Coop, Mina finds a hidden hatch leading to another bunker where Professor Rory Kilmartin (John Lynch), who constructed the Coop, researched the Fairies and they learn more about the Watchers through his computer files. Will they succeed to escape?""The Watchers"" (2024) is a supernatural movie with an intriguing beginning and terrible development and conclusion. The plot is flawed, with many unanswered questions, like for example why Mina proceeded following a weird route instead of returning to another road. Or how Dr. Kilmartin built the bunker and the Coop? The explanation that he brought poor people to work in the forest is not plausible. Or how people in the Coop washed or changed clothing. Or how they drink water. Or how they have haircut and Daniel shaved himself. How a university let a stranger enter the room of a professor to collect his research. It seems that the gorgeous Dakota Fanning when she was a young girl has become a woman with plain beauty.

The movie's strong points ends here.Unfortunately, the script and character development is very uneven. While some characters like Ciara and Daniel are well played and developed, the protagonist Mina, played by Dakota Fanning, is a poorly developed character, an unpleasant person, who, despite having a sad story to tell, cannot harnesse the necessary empathy from the audience. Her constant expression of ""screw the world"" means that when you watch it, you're rooting more for her to get screwed than for her to do well.The film would be much, much better if the script had delivered a more captivating protagonist.

My expectations were quite high because though this is Ishana Night Shyamalan's feature directorial debut, she's written & directed many fantastic episodes of Apple TV's horror/thriller series, Servant(2019-2023). Dakota Fanning is brilliant as Mina. Georgina Campbell is amazing as Ciara. Olwen Fouere is fantastic as Madeline. Oliver Finnegan is subpar as Daniel. The supporting cast is excellent.

I'm also happy that an author whose work I appreciate it getting the attention of Hollywood to have his work made into a different media form - let's hope if his other works become film or television adaptations, that they'll be given the adaptation they deserve.",7.0,bob_james9397,2024-07-08,2.0,2.0

1086747,No summary,"Mina (Dakota Fanning) is a young American woman living in Northern Ireland working at a pet shop who is estranged from her sister Lucy (Dakota Fanning) due to the death of their mother. En route to deliver a golden concore to a zoo in Belfast. A strange force leads to her driving into a dense forested area where following car trouble she is soon lost with no visible way out of the woods. Wandering through the woods, she comes across a group of three people Madeline (Olwen Fouere), Daniel (Oliver Finnegan), and Ciara (Georgina Campbell) who are living in a large box shaped structured called The Coop, where creatures known as The Watchers observe them through the window every night. In order to survive the group follows a strict set of rules including never turning their back to the window, staying in the light and avoiding being out at night, and steering clear of the Watchers' burrows where they rest during the day.The Watchers is the debut writing and directing effort of Ishana Night Shyamalan, daughter of noted filmmaker M. Night Shyamalan who produced and financed the film. The film is adapted from the 2021 novel of the same name by A. M. Shine which was optioned by Shyamalan's production company Blinding Edge Pictures for adaptation with Ishana Night directing the film in her feature debut. While the announcement caused a massive (and rather undeserved) media scrum about neopotism, keep in mind that M. Night Shyamalan has financed all his movies himself since After Earth and Ishana Night has worked under her father as a second unit director on Knock at the Cabin and Old as well as writing and directing episodes of the TV series Servant. The Watchers is honestly a well-made and polished film per M. Night Shyamalan's usual standards, but it also has a number of weaknesses in Shyamalan's style coupled with a script that seems to have struggled adapting its source material.In terms of establishing mood and atmosphere I think Ishana Night Shyamalan does a solid job of keeping the film visually interesting and getting a lot of mileage out of the dense wooded location where the majority of the film takes place. Granted this does feel like a bottle movie to a degree, but I've also seen how much a premise like this can backfire (such as the Stephen King adaptation In the Tall Grass) and this largely avoids the pitfalls of that setup. While the movie is nicely atmospheric like M. Night Shyamalan's films, it also has similar weaknesses like very subdued acting, a story with logical gaffes, and a storyline that gets progressively sillier as it goes on. While I haven't read the book and can't speak as to whether or not these issues are inherent to the source material, on screen they often invite scrutiny to an already high concept premise that plays itself very seriously without really drawing the audience into it. There's a very heavy handed mythology behind The Watchers and while that's not in and of itself a bad thing, the way in which its presented to the audience with a very fast-and-loose internal logic often causes the audience to question how something is possible rather than being immersed by it. The actors play a very one note doe-eyed confusion throughout the runtime and there's also major issues that seem like they happen or didn't happen simply because the story needed to justify going a certain way at a certain point even if it didn't have internal logic to it.I honestly wish I liked The Watchers more than I do because in all honesty it is well made enough and with an intriguing hook that I was interested in where it was going, but after it was over (with what feels like two endings in sequence) I found myself reflecting on the various aspects that didn't make sense rather than the stuff that did work. I'd like to see Ishana Night Shyamalan do another movie because she does seem like she has potential, but her work needs some added polish.",5.0,IonicBreezeMachine,2024-07-07,1.0,0.0
1086747,No summary,"Ishana Shyamalan (M. Night Shyamalan daughter) directs this horror film in a perfect family tradition of creating a movie that is progressively worse than the one before it. M. Night have not made a really good movie in his later career, and this one is worst than his worst one, to the point where it is almost a B-movie.Story: An American girl is taking a trip to deliver a bird between two remote places in Ireland. The girl (Dakota Fenning) is socially isolated and do not have real friends and detaches herself from her family. This would cost her since she is stuck in the woods alone. Luckily she finds a shelter with some collection of weirdos that are subjected to some sort of monster-aliens that keeps them in a hut equipped with a large one-side mirror so they can watch them. Kind of a big-brother IRL, only a one that makes close to zero sense.Unlike ""Big Brother"" show where dramatic dialogues are aplenty, in ""The Watchers"" there is almost no dialogue, and when there is, it is not what normal people will say / do in that situation and it is just plain boring. Dakota Fanning acting is stiff, and while not being the worst I've seen, together with again sub-par acting from Olwen Fouéré and the rest of the supporting actors, it is really not a fun watch. Maybe they were trying to bore the Watchers to death? IDKThe movie is not scary in the way a horror film should, neither it is new, fresh or interesting. It is no more than a lousy nepotism attempt in getting Ishana into the movie industry. It is safe, based on a novel, there is safe photography, semi-recognizable lead, and most action is in a single place that can be easily created with CGI or filmed in a small studio, to keep the cost down. To me it was a plain middle finger poke into the eyeball of moviegoers.I did not stay till the end. I'm not going to finish the stream later either. It is not enjoyable, neither it is eye pleasing or scary. Unfortunately I don't think it is the last we will hear from Ishana. The only hope is that in some miraculous way, the Shyamalans can somehow turn the tide and produce a good non-safe movie in the future that is actually worth their legacy name.Two thumbs down from me.

1086747,No summary,"The first thought that came to my mind was literally ""like father, like daughter"". Ishana Night Shyamalan, yes the daughter of M. Night Shyamalan, makes her directorial debut with The Watchers. Proud dad Manoj has made the strangest films in the past and even managed to win 2 Oscars with them. He stayed on as producer of the film and his daughter Ishana adapted the book of the same name by A. M. Shine into a movie and it is now in theaters. In the leading role we see Dakota Fanning, who started acting at a very young age. You know her from films such as I Am Sam, War of the Worlds and later she also played the role of Jane in the Twilight films. The rest of the cast may be less known to the general public, but that often works best. When I saw the trailer I immediately got the feeling that this film could be good, because it had such a mystical setting and it all looked quite strange, something I can usually really appreciate.Still, that was really disappointing, because the film is indeed strange, but I really got the feeling I also got with films like The Village and Lady in the Water. I should maybe watch The Village again, but I know that this film did not appeal to me at all. The use of color and especially the style in the film have been copied one on one from Dad's films and Ishana would have been a little more pleased if they created their own identity and did not blindly adopt Dad's style. The first part of the film is of course a bit of exploring and seeing where it will take you. Mina works at a pet store where she is not really happy in a very boring Irish village. She packs the car, takes a bird with her and heads off to a piece of woods where at one point her car breaks down in an X-Files-esque manner. Ok, you might think it's exciting. She then comes to a mysterious sign that marks a point of no return and then a boring part of the film begins and the interest slowly fades away. When she suddenly comes out of nowhere to a house, where she is let in, the whole thing only starts to become vaguer, especially when they are eventually watched by strange creatures in front of a large mirrored window. A kind of supernatural Big Brother, so to speak.The creatures only come at night and during the day you have to run around through the woods looking for food and of course exploring the area. They can't go past the signs, because if you go past them you'll never be able to get in in time before dark and the creatures are quite murderous. You can immediately see that the film is cinematographically well put together and that Ishana delivers a professional job in terms of style and setting, but the concept of the film is simply ridiculous and goes nowhere. Perhaps the book will be better (or not of course), that's all possible, but I haven't read the book and didn't really plan to, especially after seeing this movie. The use of color, the camera angles, the environment, the cast, the film actually has everything except the story. Because at a certain point it becomes clear what the beings are and what the purpose of the beings is, but even then I was like ""what the..."", it just doesn't make any sense at all and the final denouement was in my look even more ridiculous.The Watchers is a skillfully made film with beautiful camera work and beautiful use of color, but the story is just too ridiculous for words and just makes no sense at all. At the beginning you will still appreciate the mysticism, but the further you get into the film, the more boring and uninteresting the film becomes. The debut of M. Night Shyamalan's daughter is good in terms of craftsmanship, but it really deserved a better script. Despite this film, Ishana Night Shyamalan is a name I will look forward to, because everyone can start in a minor key and everyone makes a bad film sometimes, I mean, just look at her father who plays dragons in films like Lady in the Water delivered, but if he delivered a good film, then it was immediately really good and in that respect the same may well happen with this newcomer. As far as the film is concerned, it's better to skip this if you want a scary evening, because besides the fact that it's just not scary, the story is also just ridiculously bad.",4.0,michvanbeek,2024-07-03,6.0,2.0

Something about the matter-of-fact way it was compiled is keenly felt, as if you could actually see who was told to do what in all the little moments between filming. This gives the impression of watching an attempt to create this movie as opposed to experiencing the story in a natural way. There's a flow to well-designed films that's lacking here. The awkward pause during what should be a frantic journey just to dump exposition. Or an irrational decision that contrasts with an established personality put in only to fail at creating tension. Dakota Fanning seemingly phoning it in here and there. She isn't actually doing that, but the way it's put together conveys the appearance of this from time to time. These things take you out of it rather frequently, and once you realize it's a director's first film everything makes sense.I don't want to give the impression this is bad. I enjoyed it. Even counting some of the expected cliches or predictable plot development, the reasoning behind what happens is actually pretty good.

While the movie starts off a bit slow, it quickly picks up, with a simple yet engaging plot. The atmosphere is eerie and creepy, avoiding the overuse of jump scares that have become cheap in many horror films. The tension builds gradually, creating a sense of dread that lingers throughout the film.Although the story isn't groundbreaking and feels familiar, it's still quite enjoyable. There's a certain charm in its straightforwardness, allowing the viewer to become easily invested in the narrative. However, the acting was a major downside for me. The cast didn't feel natural or dynamic with each other, despite their efforts. The interactions seemed forced at times, which detracted from the overall immersion. The character backstories also needed more development, as they felt somewhat shallow and underexplored. A deeper dive into their histories could have added more layers to the narrative and made the characters more relatable.Furthermore, I believe a different cast could have significantly improved the film. The chemistry between the actors was lacking, and a more experienced ensemble might have brought out the nuances in the story more effectively. Despite these shortcomings, the film manages to maintain a gripping atmosphere and keep the audience engaged.The ending is very satisfying, and while the twist is predictable, it still makes for a solid horror flick.

The answer is unfortunately a ""no"" that yearns to be a ""sort of"" in the case of The Watchers. A muddled blend of Irish fairy folklore and wilderness escape room intrigue, it stars Dakota Fanning (always reliable) as a girl who gets lost in the woods while on a UK trip and ends up trapped in a mysterious building that her fellow captors dib ""the coop,"" but it looks less like a coop and more like a fancy-shmancy woodland AirBnb property. Every night they are visited by Watchers, mysterious entities that pose a vague threat that steadily grows as Fanning breaks every rule in the book trying to get to the bottom of their situation, and escape. It's a shame because the cinematography here is beautiful, all hazily lit auburn strokes and dense forest, like an adult version of those awesome Spiderwick book illustrations. It's the story that suffers from being an unimaginative retread of other flicks that presented the material better, and it's not even remotely scary for a second. Fanning does her best and others in the supporting cast like horror vets Olwen Fouéré (Mandy, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and Georgina Campbell (Barbarian) try to support her but the script lets all of them down. Around the halfway mark the action drastically shifts, the story loses all anchor point and goes flying untethered to the wind, a narrative lost in incoherence.

1086747,No summary,"The Watchers is a suspenseful slow burn with a lot to offer in terms of atmosphere and intrigue. Set in the wilds of Ireland, the film follows a young artist, Mina, who finds herself stranded alongside three strangers in a seemingly endless forest. As night falls, they become increasingly aware of unseen watchers lurking in the darkness.The beauty of ""The Watchers"" lies in its unsettling mood. The vast, silent forest is filmed with a sense of looming dread, and the sparse dialogue only amplifies the feeling of isolation. The mystery of the watchers themselves is also compelling, with hints of a rich mythology that pique the audience's curiosity.However, the film falters in its execution. The pacing can be glacial at times, and the characters, while adequately portrayed, lack the depth needed to fully invest viewers in their fates. The limited scares rely heavily on jump cuts, which may prove predictable for seasoned horror fans.The biggest letdown might be the ending. While Shyamalan attempts to deliver a signature twist, it feels less like a shocking revelation and more like a convenient way to tie up loose ends. It leaves some plot threads unresolved and fails to deliver the full-fledged payoff the built-up tension deserves.Overall, ""The Watchers"" is a visually stunning and atmospheric film with a promising premise. Yet, the slow pacing, underdeveloped characters, and underwhelming twist prevent it from reaching its full potential. It's a decent watch for those who enjoy slow-burn horror with a strong sense of place, but those seeking edge-of-your-seat thrills or a mind-blowing conclusion might be left wanting.Here's a breakdown of the film's strengths and weaknesses:Strengths: Beautiful cinematography, suspenseful atmosphere, intriguing central mystery.Weaknesses: Slow pacing, underdeveloped characters, predictable scares, unsatisfying ending.If you're looking for a visually captivating and atmospheric horror experience with a touch of mystery, ""The Watchers"" might be worth a watch. Just keep your expectations in check for the payoff.",6.0,arsalanweb,2024-06-30,5.0,4.0

1086747,No summary,"The buildup's nice, the colour grading, the whole setup hit the tonality on point and I really liked how well the mystery surrounding the forest and its 'residents' are sustained for the first two acts, though everything gets a bit convoluted in the third, and the supposed ""payoff"" failed to leave an impression albeit that had more to do with the director's inability or rather 'inexperience' to handle dramatic discourse rather than what was on offer from the source material's side.Ishana Night Shyamalan, as the debutant did a commendable job whenever the script concerns with any horror / thriller constituents. She knows how to build tension, she seems to be well aware of the intricacies involved.It's the drama, however, where she fumbles, it is where her weaknesses become clear, it is where she misses her mark as the 'storyteller'.

1086747,No summary,"To begin with, the cinematography is beyond beautiful. Gorgeous shots with eerie and cold atmosphere, which makes them perfect for a horror film.When it comes to the story, it is a bit lackluster, yes, however it honestly exceeded my expectations. I was expecting the plot to be some very common horror plot based on the trailer, but no, it is very unique and enjoyable.I see some critsism for the characters, the lead especially. People are saying that she's stupid, selfish and makes unrealistic descisions, and I have to say I disagree. Her not being very likeable and ""selfish"" is very obviously on purpose and honestly, it makes her more realistic. I think the idea of her being stupid comes from the fact that she didn't immediately believe others on something supernatural happening and had to check for herself before fully comitting to the rules and i hate to say it again, but that makes her even more realistic in my opinion.I, personally, liked it. If you're an average horror fan like me, you'll probably enjoy watching it too, it's also not very long and something is always happening so it won't bore you. The film doesn't really rely on jumpscares either, moreso on the atmosphere, It's a very specific vibe, the camera work, the music and etc makes you think that there will be a jumpscare, but there won't, mostly, and i always appreciate a horror movie that doesn't rely on jumpscares to actually procleim itself as a ""horror movie"".So in conclusion, a good watch!",8.0,tearsofhoe,2024-06-30,3.0,3.0

1086747,No summary,"All those nights that Ishana Night Shyamalan must have spent reading up on Irish folklore (beyond A. M Shine's novel, i.e.) frankly get a disappointing payoff in the form of The Watchers. The debut director (+ nepobaby) exhibits a solid grasp on the visual side of things, and though the film isn't scary in the slightest, it gives you early hints of her style of framing and compositions. The material is more mythical fantasy than horror, and even when she attempts incorporating conventional horror tropes (like discolored eyes, distant howls, weirdly tall creatures, etc.), they fail to enrich the plot.I don't know what kind of character development the protagonists get in the novel - none of them (including Dakota Fanning's) get any worthwhile emotional arcs in the film, that's for sure. It's not a good look when a golden conure exhibits more personality than any of the protagonists, is it? The film only works when it's mimicking moments from A Quiet Place (shhhh, don't move.. they're ""watching"" - what a bunch of voyeuristic fairies, I tell you!) but even they lack any thrilling outcomes.There's also a lot of essential information held back until the final moments, which indeed hold a lot of storytelling potential. But it all unfurls so late in the game that the aftertaste it leaves isn't remotely close to the impact the makers would've hoped for. The writing, just like recent M N Shyamalan's works, needs better detailing and dialogues. The climax did nothing (except be mildly unintentionally funny) - even the last bit of dialogue leaves you hanging. The film draws to a close with the feeling of ""wow, this could've been a lot better.""",4.0,arungeorge13,2024-06-30,4.0,2.0

1086747,No summary,"This was a movie that I believe went onto my radar when looking at Georgina Campbell from her earlier film Barbarian. As this came closer to coming out, I saw part of a trailer at the theater. What caught my attention was that this was written and directed by Ishana Shyamalan, daughter of M. Night. It stars Dakota Fanning and Olwen Fouéré as well. I saw this opening night at the theater.Synopsis: a young artist gets stranded in an extensive, immaculate forest in western Ireland. After finding shelter, she becomes trapped alongside three strangers, stalked by mysterious creatures each night.We start this off with John (Alistair Brammer) as he's running through the woods. He checks his watch when he comes to a marker saying, 'Point of No Return'. It also has a number under it. He runs past, but gets frustrated when despite going forward, he somehow doubled back to that marker. He tries to climb a tree and ends up falling. There's something in the woods after him.It then shifts over to Mina (Dakota Fanning). She works at a pet shop. We see that she is a talented artist and she is also troubled. We get more of that as we go on. She is ignoring calls from her sister. She is asked by her boss to take a rare bird to a zoo. It is a day's drive and he thinks that she needs time away, to which she agrees.She runs into an issue though when she is driving through the thick woods from the synopsis. Her car dies suddenly. She sees a marker like the one that John saw. She believes that someone must live close by. She takes the bird and seeks their help. When she gets too far from her car, it disappears. That's when she meets Madeline (Fouéré). She tells her to follow, but she must hurry. There's something in the woods after her.They make it to a building. It looks to be made of concrete. One side has a mirror. This is a one-way glass where something outside can see in. Staying there with Madeline is Ciara (Campbell) and Daniel (Oliver Finnegan). Ciara is married to John and she is waiting for him to come back.This group has been living here for a stretch. There is something different about these woods. It prevents them from leaving. There is also something that watches them through the window. They must stand in front of it each night or it upsets whatever watches them. There are rules here. Do not go outside after dark, stay to the light and avoid these large holes that lead to tunnels underneath the ground. Something to include here, Mina has a troubled past that she won't forgive herself for. Her defiant nature might be what they need to get free of their curse. It also could spell their doom.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I'll then start is that I didn't realize until the end that this is a based off a book. I'm intrigued to check that out, because there seems to be rich mythology here. To build on that, I guessed what the creature was going to be the moment I saw the giant holes. I'll be cryptic here to not spoil it, but it is something that is being used more lately in cinema. I do like aspects that are built in to build atmosphere and tension.Now that I have those opening thoughts there, let me delve more into this one. Since I haven't read the source material, I'm not sure how much of this is from the book and how much is something that Shyamalan did. What is intriguing is that this feels in the same vein as something her father would do. There's a fairy tale feel to what we're getting here. It feels like it is still in our world. I got vibes of something like The Village in that, we have this group that is forced to live in isolation while the outside world moves like normal. Trapping our characters in this structure in the woods is good. How big this forest is adding to the isolation. This builds up a good atmosphere. Then adding in the supernatural helps there as well.Another thing that it feels like it is borrowed from other Shyamalan films is the broken lead. We learn that Mina was ornery as a child. This led to a tragedy with their mother. She still harbors that guilt. She isolates herself from her sister who wants her to let it go and move on. That would be something difficult to do, but that healing needs to happen. Bringing back up mythology, it is said in the beginning that this forest calls to people who are broken so I like that. It almost seems like fate is guiding her to come here and trapping her. Fanning's performance does well in bringing the character to life. It is subdued. I think what she did was good, but it's not my favorite thing I've seen her in. She almost seems to be sleepwalking through the role. I don't know if I can fault her though as that seems to be by design.Let me then complete my thoughts on the mythology. I love that Madeline knows about this place. She even knows more than she is letting on. This causes Daniel to attack her at one point. There is also Kilmartin (John Lynch), who is a professor. He built this place. What is great there is that it builds on what we know in the start. The deeper our characters figure this out, the more nefarious things are. What I'll say is that there's a reveal here that I guessed the moment another room is found. Even though I did, I like that from there, it starts to become characters not trusting each other. This plays into what our 'watchers' are. It also makes sense as to why they come and that this one-way mirror was used. It makes it even more terrifying.Since I've already brought up my thoughts on Fanning's performance, let me delve into the supporting cast. Campbell was good in her limited role. She is there to almost entice Daniel now that John is missing since the younger man has a crush on her. Ciara also plays in when it seems that John is still alive. Fouéré was good in her role. She comes off as wicked the deeper we go into learning the truth here. Finnegan was fine in his role. They bring up his back-story, but I don't know if it amounts to much unfortunately. I like Lynch's role to help fill in more history. Brammer works as a catalyst. I also would say that Siobhan Hewlett, Hannah and Emily Dargan. They help develop Mina and her story which works. I'd say that for the most part, the acting fits what was needed.All that is left then is filmmaking. I thought that the cinematography and framing were good. How they set up these woods, that isolated feel and with how distorting being that deep can be. I'd even say that the look of the creatures were good. They keep them mostly to the shadows, which is a strong move. When we do see them, they're done with CGI. I don't think it looks great. We also don't get a great look at them so it works. Like I've said, I thought that this built a good atmosphere. Being trapped in the woods and something preventing you from escaping. There seems to be magic or a curse trapping them. Then you have monsters which is terrifying. The sound design works there, hearing the creatures scream and then attacking the structure inside. This was one of the stronger aspects for sure.In conclusion, I thought that this was a fine movie. There are good aspects to it. The mythology that this story builds on being one. Another is trapping our group of characters deep in the forest. Where it then goes as they try to escape was fine. The problem is that I feel there is more to this than what we get and it was just missing something to fully come together for me. I did find my interest waning a bit. Fanning was fine as the lead. I personally thought that she was asked to play the character this way and the supporting cast was a bit stronger. This is made well-enough with the cinematography, framing and sound design leading the way. What I'll say is that I think this would be a good gateway horror film for sure. I do think it is still worth a watch as well.My Rating: 6.5 out of 10.",7.0,Reviews_of_the_Dead,2024-06-24,3.0,2.0

1086747,No summary,"First of all, it's Night Shyamalan Jr who has so few productions credits on her resume that all of sudden she is helming a major motion picture? Hm, I sure wish my daddy was relevant twenty-five years ago so that I could go and hang out with Dakota Fanning and make a mediocre film spending Hollywood money on the Emerald Isle. Nepotism sure looks great on the inside.Even worse, the script is so hokey at times. It seems written by 8 year olds. The initial exposition in the Coop is just thrown at us. I suppose the stilted delivery makes sense considering later developments. But at times, you will cringe at a lot of the lines of dialogue here. And so much of the backstory of certain characters is just typical box-checking, reducing characters to stock archetypes.Oh, and the family-patented ""twist"". Yes, we were all looking for one or more. And here they are mostly a big yawn, having been telegraphed as soon as plot points were revealed - mainly because the plot is somewhat convoluted with its own internal logic. Things had to be spelled out and the minute they are, they foreshadowed any surprise. In fact, I think the less that was explained the better the story would have been.The effects were okay when the movie was lowly lit and things were obscure with dark, fog and forest. But at the end, the CGI was really sketchy. Like Van Helsing bad.I guess it is watchable - get it? Get it? - if you have nothing to do with 100 minutes of your life.

1086747,No summary,"Mina (Dakota Fanning) is a troubled soul. She's an American in Ireland working in a pet shop. Her boss tasks her to transport a parrot to a zoo in Belfast. She is driving in the woods when her car stops functioning. She becomes impossibly lost. Madeline (Olwen Fouéré) directs her to a building called The Coop. Ciara (Georgina Campbell) and Daniel (Oliver Finnegan) are waiting there.This is directed by M. Night Shyamalan's daughter Ishana Shyamalan. She certainly has her father's movie sensibilities. The seed does not fall far from the tree. This is a case of dream logic. At times, I thought that this could actually be a dream. The logic makes sense if one doesn't dig too deeply. For example, no one should ask who built the bunker or how. Also, what does the parrot eat? Most importantly, where did the rules come from?

It would have to be one of the best horror films I have watched for 2024 so far, and I guess, there hasn't been a lot of good ones in my opinion. Nevertheless, The Watchers is a steady-paced, intriguing film with an Irish/Celtic folklore/mythology crossover that had me on the edge of my seat throughout the film. Dakota Fanning and the rest of the cast were superb in their roles. I loved the creepiness and atmosphere. It reminded me slighting of the television series From. When you start getting into the explanation of the folklore of the fairies, you can really see a kind of vampire, alien grey cross-over style to them. If you love creepy videos about mimics and changelings, then this movie is worth checking out. Refreshing horror without the need for gore. Loved it.",9.0,destiny_west,2024-06-29,1.0,4.0
1086747,No summary,"I've always been a Shyamalan fan. Even his bad movies are usually entertaining. But I was a little surprised to see his daughter given the role of director in a wide-released theatrical film. After watching it, I'm baffled by the decision, both by the studio who allowed this, and by her father for starting her career with this absolute pile of garbage.This movie is terrible from beginning to end. Nothing makes sense. The characters constantly explain rules and backstory that also make no sense and feel completely random. Characters change behavior for no reason. They mention that the forest brings out the worst in you, but that never comes into play aside from that one incident.It's also extremely stupid. A couple examples, these people are trapped in a room every night for 8+ months with nothing to do. And yet none of them explored that single room to see if there is anything hidden? How dumb can you be? I'm asking the writers.In another moment, they find a bunch of information which is vital to their situation. One character says, ""we don't have to watch this,"" and walks away.

1086747,No summary,"Book to film adaptations are difficult for a lot of reasons. Books take a lot of time with a story. Words get to soak in a readers mind, characters can be fleshed out, intricate storylines can be explored over a long period of time, relationships can be eased into with flowing dialogue and a lot of different scenes.So yeah. Eveything i just mentioned a book can do well, this film fails at pretty dramatically. You can see how one could have read this book (i have not) and see a great story, with great characters and relationships. But honestly those things take great time and are very delicate. This movie did not take its time and was in no way delicate.The absolutely roller coaster of a plot was jammed into an hour and fourty seven minutes. No time was taken on anythhing of true substance. It was as if M. Night was just trying to paste scenes from a book on screen, while cramming in a wild storyline. AS a result, the plot is cheesy and rushed developing mostly through forced dialogue. The charecters are severely under devloped, there is a struggle to really like any of them because no time is taken to develop them. The relationships... were not even forced, just curiously appeared out of thin air.The real problem here is the intricate plot was just driven too hard and too fast. I've said it many times in my reviews for book adaptations, the more creative liberties a film takes the better it is. Books do not translate well on screen. It must be made into something entirely different.Points are given for its great effects, stellar ambience, and well done cinematography.

1086747,No summary,"It's rare for a multi-generational directorial family to be successful in Hollywood (we've most notably seen it with the Coppolas). That's why it was thrilling to root for Ishana Shyamalan to follow in her father's footsteps on her directorial debut in 'The Watchers.'Unfortunately (and perhaps unsurprisingly), Ishana's attempt at connecting with audiences with an Irish fairytale failed spectacularly, matching the more recent streak her father has had behind the camera compared to his white-hot early days. To be fair, the younger Shyamalan isn't fully to blame for the shortcomings of 'Watchers.'The film suffers on several fronts, most obviously the writing and screenplay. There is no real chemistry that is created between the cast, with Dakota Fanning's Mina being hardly someone who people want to pull for. The limited cast means dialogue must be that much stronger, and there is a lack of sense of fear or danger that is to be expected for a film in this genre. The ""twist"" is also seen coming from a mile away, which may be less of the fault of the director and has more to do with the fact that audiences are so used to deciphering the clues that are strewn across these 100-minute ""fright fests.""If you're looking for a scary good time, 'The Watchers' will make you wish you had watched something else.",4.0,Mike_Devine,2024-06-23,4.0,1.0

You'd be better off in a movie saying you're going to Fallujah than saying you're going to the woods.In ""The Watchers,"" Mina (Dakota Fanning) goes venturing into the woods of Ireland for a getaway. If we're being honest, she had no business there in the first place. The road she was driving on ceased being a road miles ago so she was going to be in trouble even with something as simple as a flat tire.Once she reached a certain point the car shut off and her phone went haywire. That should've been warning enough that things weren't right, but she decided to walk deeper into the woods in search of help. What she found was that she was utterly lost, to the point she even lost the location of her car. Fortunately, she was rescued by a woman named Madeline (Olwen Fouere) just in the nick of time. Madeline took her to a concrete structure where she locked a heavy duty steel door just before the loud croaking and screeching got closer. There, Madeline introduced Mina to Ciara (pronounced Kee-ra (Georgina Campbell)) and Daniel (Oliver Finnegan). They told Mina to face the glass, which looked like a large mirror from their vantage point.The next day Mina set out, again in search of a way out. After spending the whole day roaming around the forest and getting lost again, it was explained to Mina that they couldn't leave. The forest was confusing and by nightfall the ""Watchers"" would kill anyone not safely in the building with the big panoramic two-way mirror to be ogled by some creatures.This was Ishana Night Syamalan's debut film. If the name sounds familiar, that's because she's the daughter of M. Night Shyamalan. Like her father, she came out of the gate strong. I liked this suspenseful horror. It had just enough mystery and fright to keep me locked in. It was like ""It Comes at Night,"" but better.What were the ""Watchers""? Where did they come from?

1086747,No summary,"""The Watchers,"" the debut film by Ishana Night Shyamalan, daughter of the renowned M. Night Shyamalan, comes with high expectations given her cinematic heritage. As a first effort, the movie shows Ishana's potential, particularly in her direction, which highlights her ability to create a visually compelling and tense atmosphere. However, while the concept of the film is intriguing, the execution leaves much to be desired, and I found myself wanting more depth and a more satisfying conclusion.The characters in ""The Watchers"" feel flat, and the dialogue often comes across as forced and unnatural. This made it hard for me to connect with the characters or care about their journeys. Despite these issues, the film does have its moments, indicating Ishana's promise as a filmmaker.

1086747,No summary,"The Watchers is a new horror thriller directed and written by Ishana Shyamalan. This is her directorial debut. Furthermore, the film was produced by her father, director M. Night Shyamalan.When young artist Mina (Dakota Fanning) gets stuck in an unknown forest with car trouble. Here she is told by a woman Madeline (Olwen Fouéré) to come to her quickly, to take shelter in her bunker.Once in the bunker, she hears terrifying noises outside. These sounds come from beings called the Watchers, mysterious beings who emerge to observe the prisoners in the bunker. Anyone who is not in the bunker at night becomes victims of these Watchers. Mina and the other prisoners must now come up with a plan to escape the Watchers during the day, or end up stuck here for the rest of their lives, or become prey to the Watchers themselves.Ishana Shyamalan, just like her father, knows how to build a story and its mystery. However, she now has to learn to make a film more her own. This film is reminiscent of many other films such as The Blair Witch Project, 10 Cloverfield Lane and even the TV series Wayward Pines, on which her father also contributed as director and producer. The story also has some unusual moments, which sometimes makes the film seem vague rather than scary. All the rules that the characters receive in the bunker do not always seem to have been reflected in such detail. Other details can also seem a bit strange and not always everything seems to have been given the same amount of thought. When you do get answers and further details at the end, it sometimes makes the film just more vague than it actually answers all your answers. As a result, the film can sometimes come across as a bit long-winded.The Watcher largely remain mysterious in the film, because they are not shown, or only shown. This way your own imagination plays out when you hear the sounds of the Watchers before they are actually shown to you. In the darkness these creatures look believable, but when they come into the light, the quality and believability of the effects diminish slightly. Their shadow appearance may also be reminiscent of how her father tried to keep the aliens hidden in his films Signs.The acting in the film works, but due to the vague, ill-considered aspects of the story, the actors sometimes come across as if they do not always know exactly what is expected of them or what they have to do. However, they sometimes seem a bit too calm to people who know that they are hiding and being observed by mysterious creatures. Some of the characters are also given too little background to make you as a viewer really care about them.",4.0,movieman6-413-929510,2024-06-16,34.0,13.0
1086747,No summary,"I went into this film with fairly high expectations, intrigued by the trailers and the interesting concept. I recognized only one actor, Georgina Campbell, the lead from ""The Barbarian,"" a film I quite enjoyed. I was also eager to see how Ishana Shyamalan's directorial debut would turn out.To start, I think the film was very well directed, featuring some really cool and creepy shots that effectively conveyed the story without relying heavily on dialogue. The initial concept of the creatures was interesting; I assume they are based on a real mythical creature, which adds a nice element of realism to the horror genre. However, that's where the positives end for me.The acting felt mediocre. Despite what I've seen online, I had no issues with the accents, being from the UK and accustomed to Irish accents. The acting, however, often felt forced, and I didn't find the relationships or the characters' dread believable. The only scene with commendable acting involved Georgina Campbell.My main issue with the film is the twist. Without giving away spoilers, I found it incredibly obvious and poorly thought out. It felt like a placeholder from the first draft, something that should have been replaced with a more refined idea.Overall, it's an okay film.

The book is fantastic and the character development, the terror of the antagonists, the plot and twists are so much deeper than what was shown on screen. Of course movies typically pale in comparison to books, but the characters aren't even really the same. Names and backstories have been completely changed, lore has been altered, the story isn't the story. The acting is flat and the pacing is weird with multiple plot holes. It all felt rushed. If I hadn't spent so much on movie tickets, I would have left the theater and found a better use for my time because this was incredibly disappointing. My suggestion is that if you have read the novel and enjoyed it, skip the movie.",1.0,amandacallendar,2024-06-16,44.0,17.0

The thing is, this horror film combines a concept like an escape room with the world of mythology to trigger the horror. Because, the terrible creatures in this film are told as entities originating from mythology.The interesting concept and also the horror of the mythological creature only feels well executed towards the last 40 minutes of the film, from the total duration of the film which reaches 1 hour 42 minutes. Because, the terrifying nuance only feels more intense due to the presence of more mythological creatures towards the end of the film.Then, just like her father's trademark, Ishana Night Shyamalan also presents a plot twist in her directorial debut.

Night Shyamalan, delivers a chilling and atmospheric tale that grips the audience from start to finish. The movie felt a bit like the ritual or the Blair Witch project.The narrative is expertly crafted, weaving together elements of psychological horror and supernatural dread. Shyamalan's direction is meticulous, creating a palpable sense of tension and unease. The cinematography beautifully captures the desolate beauty of the Highlands, juxtaposing serene landscapes with the looming threat of unseen terrors.Dakota Fanning's performance is a standout, portraying Mina with a blend of vulnerability and resilience that makes her plight all the more compelling. The supporting cast, including Kit Harington and Rupert Grint, deliver strong performances that add depth to the story's unfolding mystery.The film's score, composed by the talented Bear McCreary, further amplifies the tension with haunting melodies that linger long after the credits roll. ""The Watchers"" is not just a horror film; it is a deep dive into human fears and the unknown, wrapped in a gripping narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.Overall, ""The Watchers"" is a hauntingly beautiful film that exemplifies the best of the horror genre.

1086747,No summary,"Ishana Night Shyamalan clearly has her father's talent (and some of his flaws) for filmmaking. Her debut film, The Watchers, is a unique gothic/folk horror film that boasts both elegant direction and some of the clunkiest dialogue you've ever heard. Ishana Night Shyamalan clearly has talent in crafting intrigue and creating an atmosphere - the best parts of the movie are those early eerie moments we spend in the woods, but too often any emotional beat or potential scare is squashed by exhaustive explanation for the next hour or so. It's not even frustrating that the final act has this jarring tonal shift made worse by a predictable climax, it's that the movie rushes through it. Blink once and it's over. The pacing is all over the place. Folklore horror is such a fun subgenre and while the imagery is there, other aspects of the film really felt half-baked. Is The Watchers flawed? Yep! Did I like it? Also yep! Something I like about the Shyamalan family's work is the total, 100% commitment to whatever fantastical story is being told. There's something beautiful about the lack of irony, the complete devotion to whatever crazy plot they are trying to sell. Ishana has something, she just has to nail the pacing. I just appreciate the heart-on-the-sleeve sincerity of it all, it feels much like M. Night's 2004 film, The Village. The Watchers starts off intense and heart-pounding, but it never goes completely into the horror genre, rather it lingers on the border of that and the thriller genre. Still, there are some terrifying moments and it starts off very intriguing. Unfortunately, too much lore and overexplaining in the 3rd act drags it down - the basic rule of ""show don't tell"" seems to have been forgotten here. Regardless of the fact that this movie is flawed, it still worked for me; I enjoyed it! The Shyamalan brand is strong with Ishana's debut film, and I really can't wait to see what she does next!",6.0,parksiet,2024-06-15,1.0,1.0

1086747,No summary,"The Watchers written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan's daughter Ishana Shyamalan and starring Dakota Fanning is now playing in theaters. This new thriller takes place almost entirely in a western Ireland forest where four unlikely companions find themselves trapped in a house and watched by mysterious beings.There were some things that I liked about this movie and also some things that I did not. First off, I felt that the movie took too long to get going. Early on I found the film to be a little boring and even caught myself nodding off once or twice. The story does pick up towards the middle, so you just need to be patient. The acting in the movie was overall pretty good, except for the performance by Oliver Finnegan who played one of the four strangers. Everyone else, especially Dakota Fanning, did a good enough job to overshadow his poor acting but it was still noticed by me and still took me a little bit out of the story when he was on screen. The story pulled from local folklore which added to the overall theme of the movie and I felt made it very cool. Folklore has always been something that has fascinated me and I felt that Shyamalan did a great job of incorporating it into her story.Overall, this is a solid thriller film and I recommend checking it out. This is definitely one of those movies where I was not sure how I felt about it right after it ended, but the more I think about it, the more I like it.",7.0,MovieswDan,2024-06-15,3.0,9.0
1086747,No summary,"The Watchers is a decently watchable film in the moment, but one that doesn't really leave much of an impact.Ishana Night Shyamalan cultivates a pretty good atmosphere throughout with a solid directorial debut. The whole thing feels like a sufficiently creepy film which is very important as the story is lacking in a few areas. Certain parts of it feel inventive and unique, but in many ways it also feels quite derivative. The result is a film that ebbs and flows but ultimately makes little impact.What does make an impact though is the performances, which are all pretty solid. Dakota Fanning is very watchable and the small cast all put in equally commendable performances.So while this film is very watchable and does have its perks, there just isn't enough to really draw you in and give you a real fright or any real interest.

I think this is really the movie for you. Its not super scary. But it has some jumpscares and a good ambiance. The area where the movie is filmed is super pretty. At first you're kinda wondering how the movie is going to go. But we learn a lot along the way.Its not a slow movie and builds up kinda quickly. I was afraid we were getting a ending but still havent learned much about who the watchers are and why they there. But the ending explains everything and has a nice twist to it.

1086747,No summary,"I watched The Watchers (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline follows a young woman whose car breaks down in the wrong area, leading her to stumble into haunted woods where the only way to survive is to stand in front of a window and be watched at night, while scavenging for resources during the day. She doesn't believe this is the only way to live or that there's anything out there, so she plans to figure things out and discover just how real their situation is.Directed by Ishana Shyamalan (Servant), in her major motion picture debut, the film stars Dakota Fanning (War of the Worlds), Olwen Fouéré (The Northman) and Georgina Campbell (Barbarian).This movie feels like an M. Night Shyamalan film in just about every way. The cinematography, camera angles, settings, and backgrounds are beautifully shot. The film is visually stunning. The storyline is unique and keeps you interested from beginning to end. The creatures in this are magnificently presented. There are some great kill scenes that are solid but could have been better executed for horror enthusiasts. The ending has multiple smart twists that made me smile, but like an M. Night Shyamalan movie, I was left uncertain about whether I loved the ending or not.In conclusion, The Watchers is a brilliant introductory film from Ishana Shyamalan that she should be proud of. The film is meticulous, with a smart and intricate storyline and worthwhile content. I would score this a 7-7.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",7.0,kevin_robbins,2024-06-14,7.0,16.0

People stuck in a room with a window being watched by unknown entities, seemed a fascinating premise to me.Unfortunately my fascination with the premise dwindled the more the film went on. I am a fan of horror, I love the potential for innovation and risk taking in the genre, particularly from new film makers. But The Watchers was lacking originality, maybe not in the concept, but certainly in the structure and execution.The more original aspects came from the lore and mythology. There was potential here for an interesting story but it really fell flat for me. Almost everything we learn is told to us by the characters, in awkward, exposition-filled dialogue.And the dialogue stands out as one of the weakest elements of the film. Sometimes I felt as though I was listening to place-holder dialogue, it was so generic. It gave the impression of a script written by people who had almost no interest in their characters.Technically, it's a well made film, it has an appealing asthetic and looks polished. The sound design is good and the score is effective.Overall I was very disappointed but I am judging it as a horror film.

1086747,No summary,"Now my Irish geography isn't brilliant, but even I know that to drive from Galway to Belfast takes about four hours and does not involve any forest tracks. Nevertheless, pet shop worker ""Mina"" (Dakota Fanning), who is still coming to terms with a not very recent tragedy, sets off with her rare yellow bird only for her car to break down in the middle of an ancient forest. With no phone reception, she decides to leave her car and taking the caged bird with her, proceeds to wander through the trees shouting help! Pointless? Well no, as it happens, because she luckily encounters ""Madeline"" (Olwen Fouéré) who lives in a large concrete bunker with ""Daniel"" (Oliver Finnegan) and ""Ciara"" (Georgina Campbell). It appears that they have all been stranded in the woods and take shelter after sunset from the ""watchers"". These are mysterious creatures who like to come and watch their guests, via a great big one-way mirror, for a while each night. ""Mina"" is determined to escape and with the help of ""Daniel"" reckons she has a plan, but this just irritates their captors to the point that their ""coup"" is no longer safe. Hey, but wait - there's a submarine hatch in the floor, and when they go down they discover a lot more about who their enemy are, what they want and just who built this equivalent of a nuclear fall out shelter under the trees. Can they use this information to escape the trap and make it to freedom? At times it is quite menacing with their dark and wooded surroundings adding a degree of malevolence to an antagonist that we never really see and whose Gaelic mythological provenance is disappointingly undercooked. It has a go at ending a few times, but then comes back to add a little more to signal what I thought was that there'll be a sequel along shortly, rather than finish the adventure completely.

1086747,No summary,"Ignoring the nepotism and the blatant plagiarism (inheritance?) of her dad's signature approach to horror (funnily including his flaws), Ishana Night Shyamalan's ""The Watchers"" doesn't really stand out in any way to be a memorable debut. And as mean and discouraging as it might sound, it mostly boils down to a laughably silly storyline and a rather amateur and unpolished directorial effort.The movie is about a woman who is trapped in a forest with three other strangers surrounding almost supernatural circumstances. The movie unfolds in a way that makes you realize pretty early on that whatever explanation is coming probably isn't going to be all that convincing, nor interesting for that matter, but you won't realize just how spontaneous and silly it all turns out to be. It's not the worst concept for a movie but it starts off with such a plain presentation of lackluster enthusiasm eventually turning into just pointless lore-building that's so out of place and silly that it fails to make an impact of any sort.The Watchers has a concept that could have worked better under more experienced hands, but unfortunately it just doesn't serve as good enough a showcase for debutant Shyamalan's talents. It's a concept that needed a lot more fleshing out than to give into the first silly idea that came their way.

Even her background story throughout really does not serve much purpose to the plot . This time could have been spent elsewhere. While I didn't hate the twist at the end it took about 20 minutes to set it up which was a let down from the climax of the film where the movie could have ended.Instead of the twists I would have liked to see more time put into each of the characters backgrounds and how they got there. This could have had the audience a little more invested.Still, for me personally I found the forest setting compelling compared to other recent horror films.

1086747,No summary,"This was one of my most anticipated movies of 2024 just based off the fact that this movie directed by M. Night Shyamalan's daughter, Ishana. After watching this movie, I can safely say that this is indeed a Shyamalan movie and in that regard it has all of the strengths and weaknesses of a Shyamalan Movie.Positives for The Watchers (2024):
The concept of the movie is interesting, there are a lot of different directions that you can take this plot. The performances from the cast were all amazing. Dakota Fanning was very effective as the lead protangonist. Georgina Campball, Oliver Finnagan, and Olwen Fouere were also great, Fouere especially did a fantastic job at selling the sense of fear. The movie was shot very well The creature designs for the Watchers themselves were unique, especially for the budget that this movie had. And finally, I was very invested in the mystery of what these Watchers are and what their purpose ultimately is by the end of the movie.Negatives for The Watchers (2024):
First of all there's this storyline involving Dakota Fanning's character about her childhood and certain tragic events that happened to her and I found that part to be very dull. Also, Once the movie starts revealing the answer to the mystery of these Watchers, the movie gets a little bit dumb.There's a character that gives us information regarding the Watchers and my response to that was, ""Of course, that's the answer to what these Watcher are."" And finally, the movie goes completely off the rails in the final 10 minutes. The conclusion of this movie as well as some information regarding Olwen Fouere's characters were so stupid and nonsensical. So, as much as I want to give props to Ishyana for what she did with this movie, at the same time, she also fell into the same pitfalls that her dad has fallen into with some of his movies.Overall, The Watchers (2024) was a movie that stared off amazingly with a great premise and great performances from the cast and unfortunately falls apart by the end. However, I still highly recommend that you go watch this movie, if nothing else then to see what Ishyana Night Shyamalan does with this movie and what I hope she does in the future, because much like her father, she has my attention.",7.0,jared-25331,2024-06-12,3.0,4.0
1086747,No summary,"You can tell there's a good idea buried in the excessively twisty mess that is The Watchers. Unfortunately, Ishana Shyamalan didn't stop at the good idea and kept adding more and more and more, making it a movie that extracts too much from a concept that could have been better if the brakes were applied.Also, yes, you can see the twists coming a mile away.........Much like one of those infomercials where some loud person says, ""BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!"" The Watchers give too much from too little. Interesting premise, but it's buried under the horrible writing..... Again, Irish folklore can be great, as long as it's the right storyteller. Ishana Shyamalan is not the right storyteller. Much like her father, she doesn't know when to stop with the twists, and instead turns what could have been a good film into a predictable mess. Aside from the transparency in plot, there are far too many moments where characters state the obvious, with too many plot points forcibly glued together rather than naturally woven into each other. Pacing was also all over the place, with a majority of segments feeling rushed. I haven't read the book by A. M. Shine (yet), but I will definitely have to at some point.I didn't hate the CGI. In fact, the use of shadows made the CGI more enjoyable. The Watchers look scary enough in their night scenes and there's effort made to make them somewhat faithful to the lore they're based on. Plus the cinematography takes advantage of the foggy forestry to generate tension. There are also instances where intense scenes aren't shot right, ruining the moments just enough that the payoff isn't there..... The acting is good enough. Dakota Fanning is more than competent at playing an American running from her troubles, while Olwen Fouéré always churns out a good role in a horror film. Georgina Campbell and Oliver Finnegan are also compelling enough in their performances that you get a sense of the despair, shock, and anger they go through..... The soundtrack hits all the right points for spooky and suspenseful fair, with a heavy emphasis on violins. The noises made by The Watchers feels right for their behavior and movements, and there are many scenes where the sound effects hit just right.Again, The Watchers could have been a good film, if it was not directed and written by Ishana. Unfortunately, this is a mess, with a predictable story and a lack of actual substance. Some good components, wrong crafter. It's Shyameful, really.....

These people's idea of a trans-national interstate highway seems to be a narrow two-rut lane through haunted forests. Furthermore, this film implies that the region is largely populated by trolls, demons and ghouls.

To give the movie credit, it does craft some pretty decent fear inducing scenes that were probably the best parts of the movie.If I were to begin with all the positives, the music actually is interesting and paired with the visuals of the expansive forest it does provide and feeling of eerieness. I'll say that the premise itself of the room (The Coop as they say in the movie) and the unseen Watchers is compelling. At first glance, it's unclear how this works and how the movie is going to put the pieces together and give us the full picture. The overall settings of the movie are pretty good with both the forest and the Coop giving of pretty decent and distinct atmospheres. The Coop in particular works and though it's meant to feel comforting with the warm lighting, it also gives an artificial feeling. I'll give Ishana Night Shyamalan. The directing is pretty good all around it's really the story and characters that provide the movie problems.Now, the movies story, apart from mabye, a twist or two, is kind of mediocre and predictable. The characters themselves are kind of flat. Almost all of their dialogue is either plot exposition or character exposition and it's almost as if your being talked down to at somepoints by the story as if you can't tell what's happening on the screen right in front of you. Also, the entire story is built on bad decisions by the characters. Most of these people make the worst decisions. Some of these decisions are kind of poetic and others are pure stupidity, which does dumb down the characters. They give the characters flaws and backstories, but it really doesn't feel as though they have personalities independent of the problems which they are currently struggling with. Also, there are a lot of jumpscare and quite a few of them are fake outs. Every time one of these predictible horror moments, I lose a great deal of respect for this movie. Even though I thought that had something pretty creepy with the Watchers and the location, even if there is something scary about the first time you really see them, that's lost once after a certain point. Now, the end really loses a lot of those things that worked in the beginning and middle. Once it was over I really didn't like where they'd left it as it didn't consolidate the good feelings I had for the film and once the title dropped and the credits rolled I was almost a little embarrassed for them.In conclusion, I feel iffy about it as though there is a skill in the craft here or there. There really are some blaring issues that I don't exactly like. Maybe you'll enjoy it, but I'm not planning to see it more than once any time soon.",5.0,adamgeraghty-51989,2024-06-12,3.0,1.0

Her boss asks her to deliver a rare parrot to Belfast Zoo. She sets out but doesn't seem to realise that she is going off the beaten path eventually ending up lost in a forest. Following an old woman she arrives at a building which looks like a Beckettian bunker. The woman, Madeline (Olwen Fouéré) warns Mina that she invites death if she goes outside after dark. Madeline, a former lecturer informs Mina that there are Rules which must be obeyed if she and the others are to survive. Ciara (Georgina Campbell) has been there for 5 months, she's hoping her husband will return, Daniel (Oliver Finnegan) is passing his 8th month in the bunker. Madeline is a longtime resident. One wall is a mirrored window, the four must stand, and sometimes perform for the Watchers, unknown creatures who gather outside. A strange Folk Horror tale summoning up legends of a lost race which preceded human settlement and for a time co-existed. When we see the creatures they scuttle like spiders but rise up and are tall humanoid. There is talk of a professor who knew more but is now gone. They have a TV and VHS player but only a tape of a reality show, also a wind-up gramophone and a few items of furniture adding to the Beckett-like feel of the bunker. Huge burrows which contain lost items, having to forage for food, trap crows, it's a bleak existence as winter sets in. The woods are threatening, all encompassing but to survive they will have to attempt an escape. Rather disturbing scenes involving the creatures and their ability to mimic humans but again the woods, the mirrored window and lack of supplies add an existential element to the terror. Particularly good performances from Fouéré and Fanning. A few interesting plot twists which I won't reveal and it's best if I keep the Rules secret as well. A pretty good Folk Horror film.

Before it goes wild in that second half, there's a strong atmosphere that revels in the fear of the unknown to great effect and even when it goes off the rails later on, the bold swings are still appreciated. Abel Korzeniowski's score keeps it investing thanks to its mysterious nature.",6.0,masonsaul,2024-06-12,22.0,25.0

1086747,No summary,"A group of random strangers caught in a spooky wood where strange creatures watch them. Creatures that only come out at night and appear to be endlessly fascinated by them doing...nothing in particular. The eventual unfolding of the backstory for these creatures is rather fun and unique, and the setting has promise, but the movie overall is hardline average at best, often squandering its premise in lumbering exposition, clumsy attempts at emotional expression and a constant stream of mind-numbingly stupid choices by a mostly wooden cast of actors.As a first film for a young director, I say bravo. This is an ambitious endeavor for an unseasoned young director, and not a bad first swing. As a big screen film, this fails to claw its way up out of the burrow past other recent efforts in the horror realm, hampered mostly by its lifeless cast and self-absorbed importance. The climax could have been more effective, but comes off as a miraculous and undeserved redemption that might have landed better as a tragedy.What I do like about the Shyamalan clan movies, is that they attempt (if awkwardly at times) to blend terror with human themes, with the emphasis on the theme rather than the terror, and they aren't afraid to infuse their horror with uplifting themes and happy endings. If we can make that happen with less pomp and more pizazz, less in-your-face message and more in-your-face filmmaking, and perhaps a bit more range in the actor performance, I can be onboard with this style of horror.",5.0,josephbrewster-88279,2024-06-12,3.0,1.0

1086747,No summary,"The Watchers is a film from M. Night Shamalan's daughter. I was quite curious about this movie because I am a fan of M. Night's early work, from the Sixth Sense to Signs. I can even enjoy some of his later films for just how crazy they could be. Plus, the trailer intrigued me. The film has an interesting premise of several people in a house in the middle of the forest being watched by unknown entities. It reminds me of movies like The Witch (2016), The Village, Cube, or The Blair Witch Project. Since its M. Night's daughter directing, I was curious as to how it would be.Unfortunately, it falls more towards M. Night's later movies, than his golden years, in terms of quality. Now, this movie is not terrible by any means. It's got a decent atmosphere to it. The acting is fine. I will say, the first half is fairly strong with the mystery of who is watching our lead characters. However, once the mystery is unraveled it becomes a very different movie, and a far less interesting one.It really reminds me of movies like The Village, The Happening, or Old by Shamalan. The problem with Shamalan's movies is that he has very interesting premises, but almost always fails in executing them properly. This movie does that as well. With a movie with a premise like this, less is more. It would have been better if we never got a real explanation of what the watchers were. We can have the characters theorize, but never give a genuine answer.One of the reasons why The Village and the Happening failed is because they tried to explain the mystery, when it would have been better not to. Sadly, I would prefer to watch those movies over this one. To be fair, The Watchers is objectively a better movie than those two. The acting is better, it's more tonally consistent, and there is an actual attempt at character development. However, those two movies left more of an impact on me than The Watchers.The Blair Witch Project does this very well. It never definitively says whether it was a witch tormenting the lead characters, or just some psycho in the woods. The film gives you enough clues to make up your own mind, but never gives a definitive answer. Cube is also a good example of this. The horror genre is the one genre where not explaining everything actual can work to the film's benefit. Because the less you know, the scarier it is.",5.0,mitchell5954,2024-06-11,5.0,2.0

1086747,No summary,"Interesting. I have thoughts about ""The Watched"". I don't think it's particularly successful but at the same time I wouldn't say I hated it either.Mina (Dakota Fanning) an American living in Ireland, is travelling through ancient woods when her car suddenly breaks down. After becoming disorientated and with the sun setting, she sees Madeline (Olwen Fouere) who encourages her to join her in an isolated construction. The construction is a room with a wall that is entirely made of one-way glass, allowing people to see in, but showing the inhabitants only their reflection. Along with two other inhabitants, Clara (Georgina Campbell) and Daniel (Oliver Finnegan) the four are watched through the window by an unseen group. Whilst they can roam safely about the forest during the day, to hunt or gather supplies, they must be back at ""The Coop"" before it goes dark.Interestingly, as soon as I learned that the film takes place in Ireland I guessed immediately what the Watchers were. I'm going to talk without spoilers though for the rest of the review. I will say a lot rests on the reveal of the watchers and there are good and bad elements to it. Generally, they are kept in the dark, a hand here or a movement there. There's one scene at night when they gather in silhouette that is very creepy. Later though you get a much better look, and their CGI blandness I found to be disappointing.The films principle failing is that ultimately, it's not that scary. The creepier moments are generally played in the trailer, the Theremin record, the applause moment. I wonder if perhaps one of the problems was Dakota Fanning's aloof and rather non-plussed reaction to all that happens to her. I also think there's an aspect of ""elevated horror"" that the film wants to engage with, with Mina's undealt with response to the death of her mother being part of her reaction.I think I've sounded pretty negative about the film so far, but there were some small positive elements. Generally, I liked the direction and, cinematography. For the second film this year, Olwen Fouere is left dishing out horror movie exposition and does a good job with it.I probably sits uneasily in the ""I don't recommend this, but I didn't hate it"" category and I do look forward to seeing what Ishana Night Shyamalan does next.",5.0,southdavid,2024-06-10,4.0,3.0

Now Ishana, who apparently is a musician (did not know that beforehand, a friend told me after I watched the movie), tries to build on ... well not just her fathers legacy, but horror movie legacy.You will be able to tell what I am talking about. The trailer was good not to reveal much (at least for me), that said, the movie is quite packed. And has a main character that we have to put ourselves into - there is not much we get there. We will get some backstory, that is somewhat important to the story and the resolution at the end.This has bits and pieces, some fit perfectly others not so much. There is an entire mythology that this tries to build or force upon us. Doesn't really work entirely though - this feels like it needed a prequel (to better understand things) or we see this as a first part of more movies to come. Maybe then a revisit will make sense.I doubt though that this will have the success that warrants those mechanisms to work and let her do more of these. There is suspense however and for a feature length debut this ain't half bad. And in line with her last name we will get a major twist towards the end.

1086747,No summary,"LIKES:The SettingThe Camera WorkThe ActingThe Character Story To A DegreeThe GraphicsThe WritingThe BirdThe Overall Story Is OkaySUMMARY:
The Watchers is a movie that for the most part relies heavily on the imagination and the isolation effect to do the lifting of the movie. Under the guidance of Ishana, I found this movie successful in accomplishing this goal with camera work that finds optimum angles to convey the emotion of isolation. A fantastic setting of the grey European forest alongside dynamic lighting and special effects draws out a dismal and isolated feeling that leaves one feeling hopeless at times given the desolate world. As the world continues to reveal itself and the Watchers begin to emerge, the graphics continue to look decent, with smooth and horrific animation, some awesome details in the skin texture, and some haunting movements that further rip away the comfort and elicit the horror element. Sound editing that accompanies it further immerses you into the doomed forest, done well to optimize the terror and try to set you up for the jump scares they were shooting for.In regards to the story to which the scares are built from, it's okay. Another symbolic and artistic approach, The Watchers' story relies heavily on some folklore for adaptation, something that does not show up until the second half of the film, and that revelation is both a bit more original and lackluster at the same time. A gradual revelation shows a bit more merit helps escalate how far this tale goes, and assists with helping draw out the horror and help fill in some of the story gaps. The character stories flesh things out a bit more, each of the four ""heroes"" holding some light and depth that hold some realistic relatability to care for the characters stuck in this mess. This movie holds heavy dialogue and the writing is smart at times and engaging, with heavy words, engaging delivery, and a strong atmospheric tone to establish the rules. I found the words brought to life well by most of the acting in the limited cast of this film. Fanning is about the same as always, listless, and creepy, and can portray the more somber emotions better than most as she faces the horrors of her past and present. Campbell offers more variety, bringing a bit of light into the movie that helps cut through the monotone depression and keep things engaging, especially during some of the trials forced upon her. Fouere is articulate and creepy in her role, all of her words so heavy, deep, and accented that they bring gravity to help enhance the story elements and somehow make the unknown more uncomfortable. Oliver Finnegan as well plays his role well, adding that unbalanced nature that adds a bit more of that psychological component to the film, further keeping the teeter-totter swaying back and forth Add in a cute bird that does very little and yet so much to help contrast the tone of the movie, and you round out the movie's likes for me.DISLIKES:The Plot's EndingMore Character Story NeededThe Revelation is DisappointingThe Twist Was PredictableMore Danger and Suspense NeededSome Odd Plot GapsA Bit More Emotional Components To the CharactersSUMMARY:
Despite all the elements that were engaging, The Watchers has issues with some of the usual nuances this movie genre suffers from. In the story department, the plot's ending is a bit of a letdown for me, not because of the content that they chose, but because the execution is mediocre and rushed at times. Perhaps we needed more gradual discovery in the woods, more time spent in the danger field, and a few moments edited to be earlier in the film. The characters needed more depth as well, helping to give them more layers like they tried to give Fanning's character and helping give me more to either root for or against. The editing might have helped with smoothing out plot gaps and questions that distracted me during the time. They do answer some of the questions, but there are still some unresolved or a stretch. And the twist that came was predictable for many reasons, and thus the revelation was mediocre for me as well. Perhaps the biggest thing needed though, is more terror and close calls. The Watchers is missing so much of that, with the climactic components very mundane because there was so much more they could do. After such an epic setup with the environment and camera work, the lack of real challenges and trials was a very disappointing finish for horror fans who like a little more bite to their thriller.The VERDICT
Another movie of mundane horror, The Watchers has elements that the Shyamalan tribe knows how to do well in their movie media. Fantastic visuals, audio, and dialogue are the centerpieces of this film, with good characters and acting to a degree to bring it to life. It blends folklore and scares in a nice hybrid with some emotional depth beyond the typical horror movie. A smarter approach to conveying terror, returning to your imagination being the primary painter, it works so hard to play off of the fears of isolation, desolation, and hopelessness that made me feel more uncomfortable than the bad guys themselves. Where the movie fails is the pacing of the plot, spreading out that allure and explanation to give the film more bite, alongside needing more time and writing to the characters to build them up past the solemn humans we get. In addition, more scares, close calls, and strategy needed to be executed so that we might have a bit more excitement in suspense in their attempts to get out of the forest. Is this film worth a trip to the theater... I'm mixed. I would encourage you to support your local theater, but this movie feels better used at home to get the most out of your experience.

1086747,No summary,"""The Watchers"" starts with all the hallmarks of a classic Shyamalan slow-burn: a moody atmosphere, cryptic characters, and a lingering sense of unease. Unfortunately, that unease eventually curdles into frustration as the film descends into a predictable twist and a blatant attempt to launch a franchise.The initial premise - a group of strangers trapped in a remote location stalked by unseen creatures - holds promise. The slow reveal of the characters' secrets and the growing tension within the cabin are mildly intriguing. But the film takes an agonizingly long time to get to the point. The dialogue is riddled with exposition dumps, and the scares rely more on jump cuts than genuine dread.Then comes the twist. If you've seen even a handful of M Night Shyamalan films, his daughter follows the same formula and you'll likely predict it a mile away. It's a familiar trope delivered with a thud, leaving you feeling like you've been cheated of your time, only with a different coat of paint.The final act doubles down on the disappointment. Instead of a satisfying conclusion, we get a clumsy setup for a sequel. ""The Watchers"" is a frustrating watch, a flickering flame that promises warmth but ultimately sputters out.

Night Shyamalan (Jury President of the Berlinale 2022), Ishana Shyamalan has developed a preference for mystery thrillers with horror elements. The local anchoring of the events in the vicinity of the beautiful Irish city of Galway is very interesting.The rather monosyllabic American Mina (Dakota Fanning) works in an animal shop in Galway. One day she receives the order to bring a certain parapet (a Schelm, who does not think of the actress Tippi Hedren from the film The Birds by Alfred Hitchcock!) To a zoo at Belfast. On the way she is in the forest of Connemara. Not everything is right there. Mina gets to a strange group around the determining Madeline (very good: Olwen Fouere), which lives in a box with a panoramic window (in the interior as a mirror) and is observed every night by eerie creatures (The Watchers!). Unlike the Naive Ciara (Georgina Campbell) and the inexperienced Daniel (Oliver Finnegan), Mina, who is plagued by a dark family secret, rebel against these living conditions ...A typical Shyamalan! What is real, what is faked? Are there really monsters outside the box? Or is everything just manipulation? Or maybe a parabola on the big brother monitoring shows on television that has been successful for two decades? The film is good that he actually plays near Galway and was also shot there. The Irish horror author A. M. Shine, who wrote the template, is a graduate from the University of Galway. And the forest in the Connemara National Park plays the actual leading role in this film. In terms of atmosphere, the young director Shyamalan does all sorts of things right. However, the character drawing is still expandable. But that is by no means due to the excellent actors. The Irish actress Olwen Fouere (born in 1954) in particular does her job very well and is something of a discovery. The young actor Alistair Brammer can still be seen in a supporting role. And there is a ""found footage"" again with John Lynch, whom you know from the Irish Cannes classic Cal from 1984 (silver palm for co-star Helen Mirren).The film is certainly not suitable for every audience, but it is highly recommended for complete Shyamalan and Galway fans!",6.0,ZeddaZogenau,2024-06-09,3.0,3.0

It felt rushed at times, and there were some plot points that fell flat. However, this was still a really good horror/thriller movie worth investing your time in.

Know the monster or well know as fairies didn't do anything extraordinary to be called the MONSTER.

1086747,No summary,"Mina is a young artist who is struggling to connect to her sister after the death of their mother. Mina finds herself lost in the woods in Ireland. She ends up in an isolated trailer with three strangers who have been trapped there for months. The four are observed by strange creatures called the Watchers. If they want to live, they must follow their rules at all times including staying in the shelter at night.I have no knowledge of the novel this movie is based on. I went in blind, but optimistic. The trailers looked really interesting and I was curious to see what Ishana Night Shyamalan would bring to the table being the daughter of M. Night. How does The Watchers fare as her directorial debut?Let's start with the good. The Watchers has a lot going for it. First of all, the movie has some really creepy and eerie atmosphere as if you are being watched by an unknown entity. Ishana Night Shyamalan does a great job of creating fear of the unknown force because any scene where the presence of the Watchers are felt is nerve wracking. The story does take advantage of the premise and sets up an interesting world with rules that make the movie feel claustrophobic. Imagine being trapped in that tiny shelter for so long... that kind of horror scares me because this not a movie about death. It is about isolation, illusion and mind games with the Watchers. It also has a theme of regret with Mina's past. It is surprisingly effective and sad when it comes into play as regret drives Mina to become a better friend and ally to the others. The story is pretty interesting for the most part and it has a lot of tension and eerie atmosphere.I like the world-building here. Ishana sets up an area where the four being watched must play by the rules of the Watchers. They have rules the four are supposed follow all the time or they could end up dead. My favorite rule is that they have to face the mirror at all times because that is where the Watchers view them. The rules feel strict and limiting and makes for an unsettling experience as the four have to stay alert at all times. I like that though because it makes the situation feel like there is no room for error and that it would break someone eventually. This is the kind of world that builds the fear of suffering and the unknown.The performances are really good. Dakota Fanning is the standout as Mina who starts off as a stoic woman trying to be rebellious, but becomes a loyal and caring person by the end. She has a few unlikable moments, but her backstory is pretty sad and her development into a compassionate friend to the others is believable. It helps that Fanning is great with both the dialogue delivery and the emotional expressions here. Also, I love that Mina watches a reality show while she is in the shelter. It is a fun trait to see as a fan of competitive reality shows and it kind of shows that Mina may feel more alone than she lets on. Mina is not an unforgettable protagonist, but I did like her more than I thought I would.Olwen Fouéré is great as Madeline who acts as a mother figure towards the others. She is pretty interesting and a lot more caring than I expected her to be. Fouéré gives the character depth with her sweet and angry moments. She also has the most interesting twist of the characters and Fouéré is great in those moments.Oliver Finnegan as Daniel shows a surprising amount of range. He is full of fun and wit at first, but he has a rebellious side that shows some animosity he built and Finnegan shows this side of the character well. I feel Georgina Campbell got the shaft compared to the other three as Kira. Campbell does her best with what she has and she has a few emotional moments and her character's dancing is endearing, but I do feel that her character could have been given more depth. The cast is overall good and they help make their characters more sympathetic and likable.Visually, the movie looks beautiful. The cinematography is gorgeous with plenty of striking shots that help build the creepy atmosphere of the film. The opening scene is shrouded in fog in the forest and it puts viewer in the position of someone stuck in the forest with feeling of being watched and hunted. It is a great opening scene that shows the viewer the creepy atmosphere and how dangerous the creatures are here. One of the best shots involves one with the POV of Mina and Madeline hiding underneath the branches while they get a glimpse of the entities that watch them every night. This is a genuinely scary moment in the film both visually and narratively. The Watchers look pretty menacing, especially when we see their shadows and just parts of them. The way they sound and move is very freaky too.The sound design is pretty good too. The sounds that the Watchers make reminds me a lot about the monsters in A Quiet Place. Ishana Night Shyamalan's direction is very strong as she understands how to make a movie look and feel creepy. The setting is simple, but effective for this kind of horror film. The forest creates several of the scarier moments in the film including the opening scene with the ominous fog and trip down the hole the creatures live in. I love the little shelter they live in, especially the giant mirror which helps create even more striking shots. The musical score by Abel Korzeniowski is very impressive adding to the creepy factor of the movie while sounding memorable and fantastical on its own.Okay, I have been praising a lot of aspects of this movie, but the biggest issue with this movie is the third act. I feel that as a writer, Ishana bit off more than she could chew with the twists, exposition and lore. I think the first two thirds of The Watchers are great with a lot of tension, an eerie atmosphere of the unknown watching them and solid pacing that never drags. Unfortunately, the last third is where most of the movies problems come to play. It has too many reveals and it almost feels like a bit of a tonal change from horror to fantasy. The pacing is also much slower by this point. As for the ending, I like the idea of what Ishana is going for, but it feels weird after the whole movie built up to be. I do not think it is as bad as some people are saying as I do think there are still some good ideas and it does develop Mina's character in a positive way, but it definitely dragged the movie down.The Watchers is a mixed bag. I really enjoyed the first two thirds with the atmosphere, visuals, characters and claustrophobia. There are some very intense and imaginative scenes. The movie unfortunately goes off the rails in its overstuffed third act. Still, I overall liked the movie because what works here I really liked. With her directorial debut, Ishana Night Shyamalan shows a lot of skill in creating a creepy atmosphere and a hearty amount of passion for filmmaking. I hope she continues to work with her craft because with this, I think she has the potential to become a great director. The best moments in this movie reflect that.",6.0,jaredkjacoby,2024-06-09,3.0,3.0

-Great story development leading to a poorly planned twist-ending
-Under-developed and/or dry characters
-Rushed ending
-Bizarre ""villain""This film was frustrating instead of intriguing or even creative. It takes way too long to say nothing. And, it's obvious M. Night's influence was taken into consideration, as many of the shots closely mirror or downright copy his signature style. I'm so disappointed in this debut film. There was potential to take an already interesting book and turn it into a film with an equally interesting perspective on local Irish lore, but instead, we get a meandering, poorly thought-out, dull mess.There were glimpses of Ishana's potential greatness as a director, though. I loved how she captured the vibrance of the forest in contrast with the safe house our main characters were trapped in. And the significance of nature to the main characters (villain included).

1086747,No summary,"Did you know M. Night Shyamalan's debut feature wasn't The Sixth Sense? He actually had two other movies that didn't do well at all before his big hit. This comes to mind when watching his daughter Ishana's debut, The Watchers. It's a fine start, though she might be following a bit too closely in her father's footsteps with a reliance on unnatural dialogue and a shocking twist.The Watchers leans more into creepy vibes than outright scares. It won't haunt your dreams, but it'll definitely give you the chills. Personally, I dug the Twilight-esque color grading; it added a cool vibe to the movie. However, the excessive ADR felt slapped together, and there were some glaring continuity errors with people and objects moving between shots.The first quarter of the movie is genuinely tense, with mysterious creatures lurking in the shadows and eerie sounds coming from the forest, creating some solid suspense. Unfortunately, a lot of the movie could've been trimmed without losing anything important. It often feels like it's going in circles, repeating the same stuff without pushing the plot forward. Despite all of the red herrings and elaborate setup, there's little payoff by the end.I didn't find the initial reveal as disappointing as others did, though the CGI looks dated, like a 2015 video game. The inclusion of Irish folklore is cool, but the movie grinds to a halt for lengthy exposition several times. This would've been unbearable if not for the strong performances by the cast. Unfortunately the script is filled with unnatural dialogue. While this might add to the creepy atmosphere, it sometimes made me chuckle at the silliness.The 25-minute epilogue could have easily been condensed into the third act, as it drags the movie out unnecessarily. While the movie starts strong with great tension-building, it eventually loses steam due to thin characters and dumb decisions. It's frustrating when characters forget crucial info just to serve the plot. Ishana has potential and could soar with better material, but this movie isn't quite there.In a year with horrors like Imaginary, Night Swim, and a dreadful Strangers remake, The Watchers is far from the worst, but it's not among the best either.",5.0,RebelPanda,2024-06-08,4.0,1.0

1086747,No summary,"I watched ""The Watchers"" without any expectations and really liked it. The film managed to capture my attention until the end, maintaining a level of mystery that is rare and much appreciated. The plot is full of surprises and interesting twists, though I feel it lacked some development around these twists and other narrative elements, leaving some details unexplained.Dakota Fanning shines in the lead role, marking a highly anticipated return to the big screen. The rest of the cast also performs well, bringing their characters to life in a way that complements the story as it progresses.The atmosphere is very engaging, thanks to excellent cinematography, sound editing, and direction by Ishana Night Shyamalan, who shows promise in following her father, M.

Despite some unconvincing narrative justifications, it's worth watching. I'm puzzled by the negative reviews from American critics (currently 28% positive on Rotten Tomatoes). This may be due to the lack of a social or environmental message, which unfortunately seems necessary for American critics to appreciate a film.In summary, ""The Watchers"" is an engaging and well-executed thriller that only falters by not fully justifying its twists and leaving some narrative elements unexplained.

1086747,No summary,"While Ishana Night Shyamalan absolutely is her own filmmaker, and should her films judged on their own merits, The Watchers reminded me a lot of her fathers works in the ways that I usually find his films frustrating. I'm going to try my best not to keep comparing this to M. Night's movies but in particular The Watchers reminded me a lot of The Village and the issues I have with that film and I think I'd still feel that way with or without the familial connection.Because like The Village, The Watchers has a very intriguing hook that presents a lot of interesting story possibilities very early on but it never capitalises on them in any satisfying way. The dialogue is really weak here and it's frequently delivered in extremely wooden ways which most rears its head in the exposition. Because Shyamalan clearly doesn't believe in the less-is-more approach in that she feels the need to over explain everything and as a result the mystery never really feels that intriguing. Most of the reveals come across as very flat that feel like they lack sufficient build up to be satisfying.It's also very repetitive for most of the first 2 acts with it essentially following the same stricture of leaving this house and returning to it before night fall and it just came across as tiring rather tension-building. The reveals don't really feel earned and they're the one thing I wanted the film to explore more but the script really feels like it strikes the worst balance with what it chooses to focus on. The 3rd act was also a pretty big disappointment. The main action that's being built up for the entire film is achieved in a fairly standard way that doesn't feel fitting for what was being set up and it makes the mistake of feeling like it's getting ready to end only to go on for what felt like another 30 minutes.Thankfully what saves the film from being a complete waste of time is the truly impressive filmmaking on display. It's gorgeously shot and visually ambitious in a way that feels like it could only come from a first-time director. I thought the score was phenomenal as was the cinematography in a way that didn't feel like it was drawing too much attention to itself. There are some very effective scares and genuine scenes of tension, unfortunately it was just never sustained enough to keep my interest. It's the script that ultimately sunk this movie for me but it's very clear that Ishana Night Shyamalan has real talent behind the camera.The Watchers was frustrating waste of potential for me and something that never really felt like it capitalised on its intriguing set up. It's just reeks of a script that doesn't trust the intelligence of it's audience and I was just so consistently irritated at how the film kept going out of it's way to explain things in the most clunky and unimaginative ways possible. I can see what Shyamalan was going for, and if anything it makes more interested to read the novel, but her very clear talents just end up being wasted on a really poor script.",5.0,cdjh-81125,2024-06-07,103.0,35.0
1086747,No summary,"Ishana Night Shyamalan's directorial debut, is a film that attempts to weave a tapestry of suspense and horror but ultimately falls short of its ambitious mark. Based on the novel by A. M. Shine, the film sets its story in the haunting backdrop of an expansive Irish forest, where the protagonist, Mina, played with a certain detachment by Dakota Fanning, finds herself stranded and subsequently trapped in a mysterious bunker known as ""The Coop.""The premise promises a chilling blend of psychological terror and survival drama, as Mina and her fellow captives are subjected to the nightly scrutiny of the enigmatic watchers-otherworldly entities that demand adherence to a strict set of rules. The concept of being observed as a form of captivity is intriguing, yet the execution lacks the depth and tension required to elevate it beyond mere surface-level frights. Shyamalan's vision is evident in the film's attempt to balance the fantastical with the horrific, but the result is a disjointed narrative that struggles to find its identity. The dialogue often veers into the realm of the vapid, failing to provide the characters with the necessary substance to engage the audience fully. Moreover, the film's commitment to its genre is wavering, leaving viewers in a limbo between a child-friendly spook and a genuine horror experience. The cinematography captures the eerie beauty of the Irish wilderness, but the film's aesthetic choices do not compensate for its narrative shortcomings. The watchers, intended to be the source of terror, lack the palpable menace needed to instill genuine fear. The film teeters on the edge of a dark fairy tale and a thriller but lacks the conviction to either fully.In conclusion, ""The Watchers"" is a film that reaches for the stars but ultimately gets lost in the woods. It's a tepid entry into the Shyamalan legacy that will leave audiences yearning for the suspenseful storytelling that once defined the family name. While it may find a niche audience appreciative of its attempt at a new take on the horror genre, it fails to deliver the gripping and cohesive narrative that its premise promises.",4.0,kmkevinn-64733,2024-06-07,12.0,6.0

I personally feel that the film adaptation falls incredibly short of what it could have been. The novel is beautifully crafted with suspense and character development, whereas the movie offers 2D characters that are simply there just because. Their faces remain blank the majority of the movie and their line delivery is flat and almost always as if they're bored talking.In true Shyamalan fashion, (yes, it's M. Night's daughter who directed it, but the apple doesn't fall far from the tree), the twist is a huge moment. While it does get revealed, it also changes a huge part of the original ending of the book, which makes the overall story even more of a 2D ""horror twist."" The book's ending gave me chills; the movie's ending gave me cliché horror.I will say, I was eager to see who would play the character of Madeline, as she is such a force in the book as the most interesting character, as well as the one who has been trapped in the forest the longest, and Olwen Fouéré portrays her beautifully. The overall set design and atmosphere of the film is also done well, which helps but also makes the movie's poor script and characters feel all the more disappointing at times.While I won't actively encourage not seeing this movie, I DO encourage you to check out the book, by A. M. Shine.

1086747,No summary,"Writer-director Ishana Night Shyamalan, daughter of the iconic M. Night Shyamalan, steps into the spotlight with her debut film, The Watchers, a suspenseful horror film that's equal parts intriguing and frustrating. Mina (played with quiet intensity by Dakota Fanning), a young artist on a solo trip in Ireland, finds herself stranded in a remote forest with no way out. Seeking refuge, she stumbles upon a concrete bunker where three strangers are already holed up. But safety is a fleeting concept here. As night falls, a mysterious force emerges, forcing the group to huddle behind a large, one-way window-the only barrier between them and the unseen watchers.The film's greatest strength lies in its initial setup. The dense, uncharted forest evokes a sense of primal unease, and the concept of unseen entities lurking just beyond the window is undeniably creepy. Shyamalan keeps the creatures shrouded in shadow for a good portion of the film, relying on suggestion and flickering lights to build tension. This approach is reminiscent of classic monster movies like Alien or Jaws, where the unseen threat is often more terrifying than a fully revealed one.However, The Watchers struggles to maintain its momentum. The plot unfolds slowly, with long stretches of dialogue that do little to develop the characters beyond their basic survival instincts. While Fanning delivers a compelling performance, the supporting cast feels underdeveloped. The film throws in a childhood trauma element for Mina, but it feels tacked on rather than organically woven into the narrative.Visually, the film is a mixed bag. The use of colour is particularly interesting. The stark contrast between the warm, artificial light inside the bunker and the cold, oppressive darkness of the forest effectively creates a sense of isolation and vulnerability. However, some of the CGI effects used for the creatures later in the film feel a bit clunky and detract from the overall atmosphere. The editing is efficient, with jump scares used sparingly and to good effect.The film's ending, a signature Shyamalan twist, is sure to spark discussion. But unlike some of her father's more successful works, it doesn't quite land here. It feels more like a desperate attempt to inject a jolt of surprise rather than a satisfying conclusion to the established themes.The Watchers is a promising debut from Ishana Night Shyamalan. It showcases a clear understanding of suspense-building and a willingness to experiment with genre tropes. But, the underdeveloped characters, a slow pace, and a somewhat underwhelming twist hold the film back from reaching its full potential. If you're a fan of slow-burn horror with a dose of mystery, this might be worth a watch. But if you're expecting a truly terrifying experience, you might want to look elsewhere. It's an intriguing film with a great central premise, but its execution is uneven.",7.0,steveinadelaide,2024-06-07,51.0,47.0

1086747,No summary,"""The Watchers"" holds a very good concept for a horror movie with some excellent camerawork, tension, and atmospheres but unfortunately washed up with an unreliable narrative and the not-so-good Shyamalan traits.Ishana Night Shyamalan, for her debut, pulls off a genuine solid direction as the creepy atmosphere, camerawork, and some of the tension throughout does offer some good chills and scares. Including solid performances from the cast members as well. What causes the movie to fall is its narrative which struggles to really balance itself within its characters, exposition, and creativity choices. Throwing in missed opportunities and characters that have no meaning to connect towards and ultimately making a somewhat boring fest.I personally do believe Ishana Night Shyamalan does have some talent because undeniably her direction on the atmosphere and tension does stand out.

Shine, achieving an interesting story that revolves around folk horror and a dark fairy tale, in addition to doing a great job as a director. The cast gives good performances, Dakota Fanning performs a magnificent role, Georgina Campbell plays a tender role with mastery and Olwen Fouéré demonstrates once again her histrionic ability and her Scream Queen skills.

Shyamalan's daughter has an approach to filmmaking and storytelling not different from the father and in fact the movie is received with mild reviews :)But honestly I quite liked it.

The story is sufficient but also interesting, in general the movie keeps you hooked till the ending. This is typical of father's movies. There are also some metaphors but they land quiet flat for meNot a movie for movie critics but a good atmospheric and folkloristic movie for movie theatre audience.

1086747,No summary,"Mythological soft horror, just the way we like it at Slyamalan family. Full-lenght debut from daughter of the more famous father Manoj. The movie itself doesn't lack the family's signature, but it completely lacks the tension that is necessary for a high quality work. In the end, everything is traditionally revealed to the audience, and it's a great pity that perhaps Ishana didn't find her own style here, where she wouldn't tell everything in terms of story and something would remain a secret, for the viewer's own interpretation. In short, this is how we got a copy of Manoj, which is still unpolished, less experienced and timid on an experimental level. If you like M.

1086747,No summary,"""The Watchers"" provides an interesting premise at face value. Horror movies that involve a twist on folk stories accompanied with an eerie location usually pair well together and in this case, it does.Ishana Night Shyamalan's directorial debut is one to be proud of. You can clearly see sprinkles of her father's style imbedded in the film but also boasts her own unique vision.In regards to the plot, the story is interesting enough to keep you invested throughout the duration. It reveals just enough to ask questions but not enough to give them away.The design of the ""Watchers"" is the highlight of the film. Without spoiling too much, every time they were on screen I was fully engrossed. Enough was shown of them that made me wanting to see more.The worst unfortunately, are the characters which were one dimensional and lacking realism. They acted in ways no human would in this situation, especially the lead. A good horror movie requires realistic and likeable characters to vouch for. ""The Watchers"" struggled to create such.As most horrors unfortunately do, ""The Watchers"" does have some moments that I found a bit silly. Moments where you ask yourself ""why would she do that"" or ""why did that happen like that"". Such moments didn't help the film.I was skeptical towards the beginning on the film, thinking that it would meander in its plot and ultimately be repetitive. However, as the film progressed and its locations changed it kept the story fresh and wanting more. The ending boarded on lacklustre however, I didn't mind that it didn't get too ridiculous and over the top. Felt more realistic and poignant.Overall, a decent debut film that highlighted a fresh look at folk-lore. The frustrating characters and some silly moments did prevent it from being great. 6.4/10 for me.",6.0,leestoych,2024-06-06,135.0,30.0
1086747,No summary,"I think it's so wonderful that M. Night Shyamalan's daughter has grown up to be a filmmaker. I can just imagine her childhood, growing up watching all of her father's incredible films and knowing that's what she wanted to do one day. And then having the master himself to teach you first hand. What more could you ask for? I really wanted to like this film, but it just didn't work for me.You can see that Ishana Shyamalan has had some incredible influence on her in her formative years, because this film is very well made. It's beautiful to look at and the way some of the shots are created is nothing short of masterful.The problem with this film lies in the absurd story. I understand it was based on a book, and I can kind of see it working in book form because when you have to imagine something like this yourself your brain naturally does it in a way that makes sense to you. However, seeing someone else's version of it in movie form is a hard pill to swallow.And for that reason it was hard to ever take the film all that seriously. I tried to buy into it, I really did, but it just wasn't feasible. So I was never scared for these characters and I wasn't intrigued by where the story would go. It didn't leave me with a lot left to grasp onto.Still, for a debut film effort this is better than most and there is a lot of promise here. I feel sure that if Ishana Shyamalan gets her hands on the right script she will do something special with it. 5/10.",5.0,jtindahouse,2024-06-06,44.0,33.0

It's a rare Indian movie without music and dance scenes. It's a bit funny in the early stage, but it's too confusing. Just think of it as a movie about finding a trash can, and then it starts to reverse. The reversal design is so wonderful, the ending is particularly shocking and surprising, it's so refreshing and relaxing, and it also has social significance (it reminds me of the Indian hospital rape and murder case a while ago, which was too ironic). The police took the money and really did their job. The cross narrative technique feels excellent, and the plot is full of twists and turns. Interlocking, the topic is very realistic, the actors' acting skills are explosive (it feels like they shake their heads while walking), the scene music is also good, The filming is also good, the scenes are very good, and the plot is relatively simple, but the narrative method is really too advanced, so even after watching it for five minutes, I still haven't walked out.",10.0,fan_yuhua,2024-11-15,0.0,1.0

1118224,No summary,"Maharaja (2024), directed by Nithilan Swaminathan, is a gripping thriller that combines dark humor, complex emotions, and unconventional narrative techniques. Vijay Sethupathi plays the titular character, a humble barber whose seemingly simple life is upended when he files a police complaint about his missing ""Lakshmi""-a sentimental waste bin. This strange premise quickly evolves into a deeper story of loss, vengeance, and karmic retribution.The film's strength lies in its storytelling, which is non-linear, requiring the audience to piece together various timelines as the plot unfolds. The first half can feel slow, with its deliberate pacing and ambiguity, but it all builds toward a rewarding climax. Thematically, the movie explores the concepts of karma, justice, and societal hypocrisy, cleverly symbolized through seemingly mundane objects like the waste bin that the protagonist reveres.Vijay Sethupathi delivers a nuanced performance, portraying a man grappling with both inner pain and external injustice, while Anurag Kashyap's portrayal of the antagonist Selvam is equally gripping, though his motivations remain somewhat ambiguous. The supporting cast, including Mamta Mohandas and Natarajan Subramaniam, add depth, though some characters are less developed than they could be.The film's unusual humor, especially in the police station scenes, might feel out of place for some viewers, and there are instances where the narrative choices seem overly convenient. However, the ending ties up the loose ends in a manner that is both surprising and emotionally resonant.If you're a fan of offbeat thrillers that require active engagement, Maharaja is worth a watch, offering plenty of unexpected twists along the way.",8.0,monowarhusainomi,2024-10-19,0.0,0.0

1118224,No summary,"Maharaja (2024) - A Total 'RASHOMON'Vijay Sethupathi's 50th film and Writer Director Nithilan Swaminathan's 2nd film.Maharaja tells the tragic story of an aged barber/father in a very twisted, non-linear manner. A well written, and brilliantly produced cinematic Masterpiece. This is not doubt, 2024's Best film.It's a total surprise that this film comes from Tamil film industry, With No songs, No item numbers, No Heroines, this makes no sense. It felt strongly like a Kannada 'out of the box' movie. Those writings, never watched how events unfolds in any Indian films, ever.This is the kind of movie, which you may expect to be like any other average Tamil movie, but slap you with so much twist, you will be like 'blown away' by the detail of narrative structure.If you think you are a great cinephile, and had a track record of watching huge amount of Korean, Hollywood, foreign crime thrillers, this movie is specially for you. You won't even imagine how the story is going to get concluded.At one time, while watching the film, I even thought 'Is this a TIME TRAVEL movie?'. This is the kind of movies that I really respect for being unique. A real shout-out to the writer-director for making such an effort in Tamil cinema.No wonder actor Vijay Sethupathi chose this script for his 50th film. And he made a great performance as 'Maharaja'. I don't think anyone can match him even if gets remade in other languages. The one scene, the crucial inevitable clash with the Villain, Sethu sir falls down, in afraid of seeing him, the Ghost from the Past. I don't know how many heroes would do that in fight scenes.And the villain, Mr. Kashyap tried too hard to act like a Tamilan, but his 'eating by hand' scenes ruined it completely. Mysskin could have done better. Shout-out to Mr. Kashyap's dubbing artist. And also, what a surprise to see one of the Boys, Mr. Manikandan as Dhana.Too bad, director's original choice for Maharaja Mr. Vijay Antony didn't get the part, it could have been a different movie, may be in a lighter tone. All in all, it's a great film, with good moments, nice stunts. May be the makers got inspired from foreign films (or not) but it's a great achievement that this film got made in Tamil.

1118224,No summary,"Best movie of 2024 by far in the worldit has so many layers to peel and never the director assumes the audience to be stupid . And every one who watches this movie will feel the emotions and anger and pain in the climax scene. This is rare in a movie . We need this level of writing in movies with this emotion than and action to back the writing andFrankly the climax takes your breathe away.Vijay sethupati is at his finest best and anurag does a fairly decent job
this is a crime novel which we all enjoyed in our childhood reading ,which was so exciting in the final pages we wish a movie could give that feeling of rush in our blood and we takes our breath breath page after page and the end feels the best anyone can imagine .This is that movie if you are a book reader who enjoys crime thriller.",10.0,sivaram-93379,2024-09-08,0.0,0.0
1118224,No summary,"""Maharaja"" is my first Tamil movie, and wow, what a way to start! This film is an absolute thrill ride from beginning to end. The plot is layered with so many twists that every time I thought I had it figured out, I was pleasantly surprised. Vijay Sethupathi truly shines, but it's the direction and writing by Nithilan Swaminathan that takes this movie to the next level. The script is so well-crafted that it pulls you into the story, making you feel like you're part of the unfolding drama.Anurag Kashyap, though not perfectly synced, delivers a performance that leaves an impact. The music, especially the BGM, was surprisingly subtle yet powerful, adding to the overall intensity of the film. It's refreshing to see a movie where the gore isn't just for shock value but serves to drive home the point.For a first-timer in Tamil cinema, ""Maharaja"" has set the bar high. I highly recommend watching it, and trust me, you'll want to discuss it for days! A solid 9/10 from me - and yes, please don't spoil the plot for others, let them enjoy the twists just like I did.",9.0,QAlpha007,2024-09-06,0.0,0.0

I am deliberately writing this review just to let you know whoever is reading this review YOU will not regret watching this movie. It's not the usual Indian movie you see with dances and bad action.The movie starts very slow and takes a bit of time to get your attention but when the action comes you can't even avert your eyes.I was also skeptical about the rating and the reviews and stopped the movie at the start just to check the reviews and the scores.,9.0,bilguun0309,2024-09-04,2.0,1.0
1118224,No summary,"After a prolonged period, I finally had the pleasure of watching a film that was truly worthy of my attention, and it was an absolute epiphany. The movie captivated me with its ingenious concept and meticulous execution. Every aspect, from the performances to the casting, dialogue, and narrative, was truly exceptional. The actors delivered performances that were nothing short of phenomenal, bringing each character to life with remarkable depth and nuance. The casting was impeccable, with each actor embodying their role with precision, thereby amplifying the impact of the story. The dialogue was crisp and resonant, adding profundity to the narrative. Each line seemed carefully crafted to enhance the overall experience, leaving an indelible mark.The storyline itself was gripping, maintaining my attention throughout, and the twist at the end was utterly astounding - a masterful stroke that elevated the film to unprecedented heights. It was both shocking and thought-provoking, rendering the movie an unforgettable experience. This film conveys a powerful message, particularly for those with malicious intentions towards women, serving as a stark reminder of the dichotomy between right and wrong. It is a seminal lesson for all, and we need more films like this, with meaningful narratives that challenge and enlighten our minds.Undoubtedly, this movie has the potential to make a significant positive impact on people's mentality. It deserves all the accolades and recognition for its bold storytelling and exceptional execution.Truly, this film stands out as a cinematic masterpiece.",10.0,annacaroline-71325,2024-09-04,1.0,0.0

This movie will definitely made an impact to all its viewers. The movie depicted corruption, revenge, family, love, mental disability, action, suspense, and mind-bending twist.

1118224,No summary,"This is a decent crime thriller with interesting twists and turns. Overall screenplay is a bit slow and looks un-interesting in the first half until it is tied up in the second half. There are some potholes and general liberty taken which is common to add spice to the movie. Example one person fighting 5 people with weapons and coming out on top is fine in superhero movies but it seems odd if you are considering this as a serious screenplay. There is some exaggerated violence added to give shock value is also becoming a norm in recent times. The plot twist in the second half might leave some people awestruck as it is new for India cinema, however there has been similar theme twists done before in other international movies. It is watchable one time but I would rate it average overall.",5.0,ashish-cooltech,2024-09-02,1.0,2.0

1118224,No summary,"Maharaja, a barber with a teen daughter, lived a peaceful life until some guys broke into their house while his daughter was away and he was returning from his shop. That day turned his life upside down as he started to hunt those men.This movie is an exceptional revenge thriller that twists your mind with its plot and the way of execution. I have seen countless revenge thrillers before but this one stands on top. Non-linear storyline, a complex protagonist, and a climax that makes your spine shiver.Acting-wise, this movie is an absolute ten on ten. Vijay Sethupathi shines again. Every other actor did an immaculate job but, I was just stunned after seeing Anurag Kashyap doing so well as an actor. I mean we already know he is a master filmmaker but I never thought in my dreams that he would be such an incredible actor as well. He played the role of antagonist here and he nailed it.This masterpiece introduced me to Nithilan Swaminathan, whom I found as a genius director. I am going to watch his other movie ""Kurangu Bommai"" next. He is such a genius, probably one of the smartest directors I have seen in Tamil Cinema, or maybe the entire Indian Cinema right now. The way he split the entire storyline into three parts, showing each shot precisely at the right moment, and filling up the entire movie with different symbolisms, etc., proves that Nithilan Swaminathan is not an ordinary filmmaker. I enjoyed his work and I want to see him grow in the future. Hats off to this upcoming legend.Many things separate this movie from other revenge thrillers. Symbolism, non-linear storyline, etc., are awesome as I have already mentioned before but, the real thing that makes this movie a true masterpiece is the climax. This movie has the most shocking, unsettling, and traumatizing ending I have ever seen in an Indian movie. The movie reveals the past truth in such a way that it becomes hard to believe what just happened, yet we believe it because it is the bitter truth. The protagonist suffered during the entire movie and we connected with his pain in the second half but, the antagonist had such a brutal and painful ending that left him no other choice than choosing death. This climax reminded me of the classic Korean thriller ""Oldboy"" which had a much more disturbing and agonizing ending.In conclusion, I just want to say that this movie is a must-watch. It shows how powerful a screenplay can be and how a smart director can turn a simple story into something that we never saw before. No matter if you are a cinephile or a mass audience. This movie deserves your attention and it is going to stay with you for a long time.",10.0,hanan-77633,2024-09-01,0.0,0.0

story is small and you can predict the events or upcoming plots, This movie doesn't satisfy you but give you a treat to dishearten youself in grief.Other than that, everything is fine, even when you know the story you stay intact because of good actors.

1118224,No summary,"The movie offers a solid storyline that keeps the audience engaged for the most part. The plot is well-constructed, with a strong foundation that allows for some intriguing twists and turns. However, the film tends to stretch in certain areas, where the pacing slows down, and some scenes feel unnecessary or out of place. These moments can make the movie feel a bit longer than it needs to be, slightly detracting from the overall experience. Despite this, the well-executed twists keep the audience on their toes, adding excitement and keeping interest alive. The film balances these twists with its solid narrative foundation, making *""Maharaja""* a movie worth watching, even if it occasionally lingers longer than it should.

It was great to see Anurag Kashyap with his acting skills on the screen for the very first time and of course the OG Acting performance by Vijay Sethupati. This movie will keep you engaging till the final 30min and after that it will reach to it's paramount. The story picked uphill from there and will End it on a surprising note. Although 90% of the people can't predict it's disturbing climax but in my case I got that before 12-15Min because of a Korean movie, whose name I don't wanna mention here, but giving you a hint that it came in the year of 2003 and a bollywood adaptation was also there with Sanjay Dutt.Anyway! The Story is extremely simple in the starting but in the second half it just got the much needed pace and came in the mind blowing category. It's dark yet gives audiences some morale values. Kudos to the makers who nailed every small detailing in the entire movie. Songs are not there in the entire movie yet BGM of those fighting sequences were just spine chilling. Cinematography was Okeyish. Screenplay was quite tight and gripping for the all age audiences. Although first half was nearly perfect but some Police station scenes and Sports scenes could have been trimmed.This movie contains a lot of brutality and some dark violence so definitely not recommend to child audiences but in case of family audiences they can go for it. From my side it will be 7 Out of 10 Stars. Definitely recommending to go for it..",7.0,nitishkumarmohanta,2024-08-24,0.0,0.0

The only 2 other films that got over a 100 crore both suck. But maharaja is an exception. This is a fanstastic film, and even though I am a malayalee, which had some bangers like manjummel and aavesham, I would definitely put in this in top 10 of the year. Honestly its a film that only works because of its perfect script. Everything else is sort of average in this film. The performances are all just fine, except for vijay sethupathi who acts good in this film. There is surprising a lot of comedy and action in the film, but both of them are averagely done. Even the famous anurag kashyap's acting suffers due to the really badly synced dubbing. But the script is amazing. Its a complicated storyline, but the film makes it surprisingly easy to understand whats going on.

Although it was good it was pretty confusing at times as many have said. I had the luxury of watching at home so I could replay several scenes just to be sure I knew what timeline it was in. My best advice is look at the ear bandage and the shirts the main character is wearing. He is the constant in the movie so his appearance will act as the lighthouse if you find yourself getting lost.My biggest problem is with the whole Lakshmi storyline. I am not sure I understand the importance of it whether religiously or sentimentally. The whole driving theme was to recover this mysterious dust bin but was it really that critical if a fake one was perfectly fine?The negatives don't out-weigh the positives so I recommend this movie to all.

The society is not safe for women. There may be some predtors who might be looking for victims. We need to protect our society from them. I liked the acting of Vijay Sethupathi and ANurag Kashyap.

This movie starts with an accident scene & later Maharaja's family is presented as the story proceeds.The story telling is beautifully simple. One can easily understand about the story from the narative.Two main characters of this film are Maharaja (Vijay Sethupathy) & Selvam (Anurag Kashyap). VJS is a brilliant actor & he proves that in his every role. It feels the audience are not seeing any actor but seeing the character itself. VJS's facial expression is top notch in this film (quite usual for him). This film definitely is remarkable as his 50th film as a main character.On the other hand, Anurag Kashyap as Selvam surprises you with his character. As audience, we have always seen Anurag to direcct great films which tells story of chaos. He has nailed this time with his acting skill.Other actors playing police characters, Jyothi, Asifa all are good in their respective characters.One of the best thing of this film is the screenplay writing and direction by Nithilan Saminathan. He has done a marvellous job in this film which is his 2nd film.

The nuanced central performance by Vijay Sethupathi gives this revenge thriller its blazing emotional core, allowing it to shine despite being pervasively marred by melodramatic overload.There's something very inorganic about the narrative, to the point that it feels like a creative exercise. It is extremely well-crafted in every aspect, no doubt, but you end up appreciating the techniques rather than the soul and powerful themes embedded in this shocking tale.Still, ""Maharaja"" sparkles and dazzles from start to finish.

I love movies with a plot twist. 15 minutes into the movie I got serious doubts if it was worth continuing to watch it, but I figured if there's a good plot twist at the end, it makes it worth it. Maybe they will make it come together in a way that really baffles my mind. But that never happened. The story is incoherent, there's so many things that don't make sense, And the only surprising moment I experienced sort of whole movie where when I asked myself ""What the heck did the writers think?"" It's as if a 14 year old wrote a screenplay. And that great final plot twist? I saw it coming a mile away, and i was hoping ""please don't let it be that"".

When police refuses to investigate due to unbelievable story Maharaja says, He bribes them to find the stolen item. The turns of events and the plot reveal are the story of the movie.As a story it is cliched revenge drama of protagonist but the turn of events, revelations scenes make this movie more interesting. The non linear narrative definitely helped to create suspense and kept me guessing what happens next throughout the movie. The characters were well developed. The pacing of the story was good as I didn't bored or distracted while watching the movie. The interval scene felt underwhelming because I can't relate with Maharaja's action as the reason for his action is revealed in second half of the film. Even though the some twists are predictable, the presentation of those twists were good and made me forgiving the cliché. This movie is definitely a hard hitting one and may stay in your mind for 2 or 3 days.The actors did a very well job in this movie especially Vijay Sethupathy nailed his character. Casting Singampuli in different role from his usual character roles really helps the twist to hit harder than casting any other actor. Anurag Kashyap did decent job as the villain. The cinematography, color tone was good. The song where Maharaja's daily life was shown could have been better as I felt it unnecessary in this movie. I felt BGM was overdone in some scenes which would be better if they left it BGM-less or treat them with little milder music.I didn't had the opportunity to watch this movie in theater as it received good response from the audience. While waiting for the OTT release, the social media spoiled a twist with character of Singampuli and the Climax. So I couldn't enjoy or appreciate this movie whole heartedly.

As much as being a Vijay Sethupathi fan, he has been delivering horrendous and forgetful films as a lead role for the last 5 years so I believed this film was going to have an average run as well. All this was proved wrong when I watched the film which was filled with twist and turns that were highly unexpected. It has been many years since I watched a Tamil film which made my jaws drop and appear in genuine shock with what was happening to the characters on screen. The second half is filled with twists every 15 minutes and it is in your best interest to watch the film without knowing much about the story. Vijay Sethupathi does not need any words to show how great of an actor he is and uses his acting skills to help bring a dust bin to life. He pretty much makes the dustbin the second lead through his acting. The casting was perfect and every character almost lived their role. The movie is technically very strong and makes sure that nothing stands out beyond the characters and its emotions, yet delivering exactly what is needed. I believe the strong script and perfect casting choice (even for the smallest characters like Boys Manikandan) are the strongest points which makes the film work big time. The editor definitely needs a big shoutout as the film deals with such a complex writing which jumps between characters and timeline. Had he made poor editing choices, the audience may have ended up confused which would destroy the whole film yet he managed to tell the story in a way which everyone would understand. Despite the serious theme and tone of the film, the first half uses Vijay Sethupathi to create humor and it works out very well. No one in Indian cinema can beat VJS in storytelling on screen and when you watch the film you will know why. Overall, this thriller is definitely worth your time and money and you will not be disappointed.",10.0,gowshihan2000,2024-08-02,0.0,0.0

1118224,No summary,"Maharaja is a film displaying a father's love with the humorous, frustrating & cry-fest inflecting scenes which you can expect on an Indian film. It's a product of carefully thought screenplay and editing which drives you to assume that you know everything but in fact, you don't.Part of the film also displays an Indian police system full of schemes, I interpreted it as if they have a different way of serving the justice but nevertheless problematic. A family bond which you can never miss!Shot angles are simple but the editing made it effective. Also the main lead? Mr. Sethupathi, he's clearly committed to his role - his acting and line delivery is superb. The end scene symbolism was also satisfying.The message about family love (esp.

An outstanding revenge drama, with an extraordinary parallel storytelling. 2 tracks run simultaneously. Vijay Sethupathi is taking the art of under-acting to the level of Irrfan Khan. The greatest quality of this genre is that whether the character is good or bad is not clear until the end, And that is the speciality of Sethupathi. At the end Anurag Kashyap's performance is also eye-catching. But thriller experts can guess the last twist much earlier. Old Boy's essence got spread like old spice's. Only the accident is not at all convincing. A proper reason should have been found for it. Apart from this weakness, this film comes out with letter marks.

1118224,No summary,"There used to be a time when Hollywood films made you go ""wow"" when the big reveal arrives, but those times are long over, and these days only South Indian films can genuinely surprise you. For a long time, this seems to be a black comedy of sorts about a mild-mannered barber who is as strong as a bull, and who is looking for three thieves who stole his, well, dustbin. Which happened to be a memento of fortune because it covered his baby daughter when a truck crashed into their house, killing his wife. Like the cops, the viewer wonders if there isn't more to that dustbin than our hero says. And then comes the reveal - OMG WTF.Anurag Kashyap plays the villain but one can feel his mind in the script - he is the guy who turned Indian cinema around back in the 1990s with ""Satya"" and has influenced a whole generation of film makers. His performance is even better than the lead and it is hard to imagine anyone topping this in the Aamir Khan remake. It's regrettable that most Westerners will probably not discover how awesome this is and how a good screenplay can turn a good vengeance flick into an unforgettable masterpiece. However, even for Tamil standards the violence is extreme - that's the only thing that keeps me from giving this 10/10.",9.0,Radu_A,2024-07-27,0.0,0.0
1118224,No summary,"Maharaja is is a masterful blend of suspense, drama, and intense emotional depth. Vijay Sethupathi delivers a truly remarkable performance as Maharaja, a barber whose life is upended by a devastating crime. His portrayal of a desperate father seeking justice is nothing short of spectacular, bringing both grit and vulnerability to the character.Sethupathi's ability to convey deep emotional turmoil while maintaining a sense of quiet determination is a testament to his acting prowess. His scenes are packed with raw emotion, and his nuanced performance ensures that the audience is fully invested in his quest for retribution. The way he embodies Maharaja's pain and resolve makes his journey incredibly compelling and heart-wrenching.The movie is filled with unexpected twists and turns that keep viewers on the edge of their seats. From the initial mystery of the stolen ""Lakshmi"" to the unraveling of the complex web of crimes, the plot is intricately woven and consistently engaging. Each revelation is meticulously timed, ensuring that the suspense never wanes. This careful pacing makes the narrative both thrilling and emotionally resonant.Anurag Kashyap, playing the antagonist Selvam, delivers a performance that is equally noteworthy. His portrayal is so convincing that it invokes genuine hatred and anger from the audience. Kashyap's ability to bring such a despicable character to life with authenticity adds a significant layer of tension to the film. His interactions with Sethupathi are particularly charged, creating some of the most memorable moments in the movie.The film's production values are top-notch, with exceptional direction by Nithilan Swaminathan, who ensures that every scene contributes meaningfully to the overall story. The background music, composed by Dhibu Ninan Thomas, is another standout element. The score beautifully underscores the emotional beats of the film, enhancing the suspense and adding a poignant touch to the more dramatic scenes. It effectively turns the audience's emotions, amplifying the impact of the film's most intense momentsOverall, Maharaja is a gripping, emotional rollercoaster that showcases the best of Tamil cinema. Vijay Sethupathi's and Anurag Kashyap's stellar performances, combined with a tightly woven plot and evocative background music, make this film a must-watch.

1118224,No summary,"This film is movie-making at its finest (in this genre at least).Great characters, great story, direction, acting, dialogues, intrigues, mind-blowing twists, great action and gore (not for the faint-hearted), emotions, comedy.. this film has got it all.It's been a few years since I've rated a film 10/10 and this film thoroughly deserved it, because I could not find a single serious flaw in it. I just wish that I had watched it on a big screen to contribute to its box office collection, but no matter, I'll spread the word now.Let's get started. The movie starts out with a mundane yet intriguing premise, where our protagonist, Maharaja (played by Vijay Setupathi), keeps visiting a police station for reporting the theft of an item of seemingly little value, and even offers the police money for retrieving it. He is constantly abused, heckled, bashed, and ill-treated by the police (a behavior that that has become synonymous with the Indian police), and that's how an entire hour passes through. But after that, the movies switches gears, the story takes a turn and we realize that whatever we have seen so far is a big lie, and amazing details and events start to unravel on screen one by one, each more bizarre than the last one. For details, of course you need to watch the movie, I won't spoil it for you.Story is believable, though with a bit of stretch of imagination, and is very well laid out in a non-linear sequence of events. The acting is top-notch, especially from Vijay Setupathi as always, who is Mr. Dependable in Tamil Cinema. The surprize package is Anurag Kashyap, who has in some scenes, dare I say, even outdone Setupathi. I can say without a second thought that this is Anurag Kashyap's best film, and his best film is ironically not his directorial, but his playing the antagonist. I don't know much about the director or the rest of the cast and crew, so I won't talk about them, but they have all done a fabulous job.One final comment. I wish Bollywood would learn something from its cousins (Mollywood, Kollywood and Sandalwood). Apart from Maharaja, today I also watched Bhaiyya Ji (starring Manoj Bajpayee who starred in the first gangs of Wasseypur, one of the highest rated movies directed by Anurag Kashyap), which had so much buzz about it, at least much more than Maharaja had, and it just was a pathetic movie, so much so that I had to wipe it from my mind to feel good about myself.

Apart from Vijay, Abhirami has done one fine job. Every scene she has acted, she performed so well that she has powered all of her co-actors including Anurag Kashyap. Mamta Mohandas and Natrajan Subramaniam has also performed their role well. Speaking about the flaws, Fight scenes could have been much better and sometimes it felt little jump cuts.

The screenplay , story , background all add to the brilliance, they two departments lacking were mainly direction and some what acting of main character even though he is considered one of the best but frankly I find him monotonous. Overall the story keeps you hooked till the end and pf course the raving reviews about climax also helps to hang around. Somewhere flashbacksix up but you realise after 2 minutes it's a flashback.

This is 50th movie and I believe this was his career best performance. I've never seen such intense character ever. That's why he is legend. We all know how capable he is but this time he was outstanding. We have another powerful character none other than Anurag Kashyap. This time not with his direction but his performance. Oh My Gosh, how can any full-time director be as good an actor as he could? Anurag Kashyap breaking the myth. This was the most powerful villain character ever I seen. Just insane.

The film masterfully weaves together an array of twists and turns, each more surprising than the last, culminating in an amazingly shocking climax that left me speechless. Despite its complexity, the storyline remains simple yet profoundly meaningful, a testament to the film's exceptional writing and direction.What struck me first about this movie was its depth. It starts off deceptively simple, drawing you in with an engaging premise that hints at deeper layers. As the story unfolds, these layers reveal themselves in intricate and unexpected ways. The characters are richly developed, each with their own compelling backstory and motivations. They feel real, their struggles and triumphs resonating on a deeply human level.

In a cinematic landscape where climaxes can often be predictable or overblown, this one stands out for its sheer audacity and emotional impact. It ties together all the plot threads in a way that is both satisfying and utterly surprising. The final revelation is handled with such skill that it recontextualizes everything that came before it, leaving you to rethink the entire movie. It's a masterstroke that elevates the film from great to unforgettable.But beyond the plot and characters, what makes this movie truly exceptional is its thematic depth. At its core, it's a film about human nature, exploring profound questions about identity, morality, and the choices that define us. These themes are woven into the fabric of the story, emerging organically from the characters' journeys. They give the film a resonance that lingers long after the credits roll, prompting you to reflect on your own life and the world around you.One of the most remarkable aspects of the movie is how ahead of its time it feels. In an era where many films rely on formulaic plots and superficial thrills, this one stands out for its originality. It's a film that challenges its audience, demanding their full attention and rewarding them with a richly layered experience. It's the kind of movie that you'll want to watch multiple times, each viewing revealing new details and insights.The film's thoughtful, meticulous crafting is evident in every scene.

Best part is you do not have to be an intellectual to understand the work. The director did not have to explain the movie post release in twitter! Humbled and inspired at the same time by Maharaja. Everyone who worked in this classic is indeed a ""MahaaaRAJA""The level of skill actors like singam puli, natty and other actors showed is just mind blowing. Beyond imagination.

1118224,No summary,"""Maharaja,"" directed by Nithilan Swaminathan, is Vijay Sethupathi's 50th film, showcasing his exceptional comic timing and vulnerability. The dark thriller features a fast-paced, non-linear screenplay, keeping audiences engaged. Swaminathan's writing, combined with efficient editing, creates a clever plot that respects the audience's intelligence. Vijay Sethupathi's portrayal of the dour-faced barber Maharaja is compelling, making even absurd scenarios believable and authentic. Despite its strengths, the film faces criticism for its treatment of sexual violence, handling it with questionable sensitivity and occasionally portraying it from the perpetrator's perspective. Mamta Mohandas and Anurag Kashyap deliver strong supporting performances, though some characters and plot threads could have been better developed.

This film is a cinematic masterpiece-a genuine thriller with the perfect blend of mystery, drama, and suspense. It's like a delicious dish that fills your stomach but leaves you wanting more.The screenplay of ""Maharaja"" deserves special praise. I have always been a fan of non-linear storytelling as it twists your mind and keeps you engaged. Although the narrative threads start to unravel after a while, once you begin to understand the pattern, the story becomes clearer. Yet, even when you can predict what happens next, you still want to keep watching.Bollywood has ceased to produce such films, which, in a way, is a good thing. Creating a movie like this requires passion and dedication, qualities that seem to be dwindling. Seeing my favorite director, Anurag Kashyap, in a significant role was a joy. I have only seen Vijay Sethupathi on screen twice before: first in ""Farzi,"" which left me heartbroken, and now in ""Maharaja,"" which has mended my heart. Although the performances were stellar across the board, I must reiterate that when the screenplay and direction are tight, everything else falls into place.This film may not cater to the masses but is meant for those who appreciate cinema for its artistic value.

Why this movie stood in leader position is for its best cinematic creativity, story telling, cast and symbolic presentation of good beliefs and values. At start,we saw a very simple person complaining to police station for a missing dustbin, but its not the dustbin , its Laxmi ( Godess ) for him and his daughter, its symbolic presentation. Firstly its looks comic and minute by minute it takes us to dark reality of showcasing cruelty and misjudgment of social beliefs .It gives us best message at end , when the biological father is stands no-one for whom hero , who knows the love, respect and humanity !

1118224,No summary,"Sure, here's a detailed review for the movie ""Maharaja"":""Maharaja"" is a stellar example of South Indian cinema's innovative storytelling and impeccable acting. The film, directed by Nithilan, captivates the audience from start to finish without needing a big star cast. The storyline is so engaging that it keeps you glued to your seat, despite a few slightly dull moments scattered throughout the 5-10 minute range of the movie.The narrative kicks off with a seemingly simple yet intriguing premise: a barber reports to the police that his iron dustbin, Lakshmi, has gone missing after a burglary at his home. What appears to be a trivial complaint soon unfolds into a gripping tale of suspense and intrigue as the police start suspecting the barber's true motives. This gradual build-up of the plot, with its unexpected twists and turns, keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, heightening the drama with each new development.Vijay Sethupathi's portrayal of his character is nothing short of extraordinary. His remarkable acting skills bring depth and authenticity to the role, making the film even more compelling. Though the story becomes a bit predictable towards the end, it doesn't detract from the overall impact of the movie.In conclusion, ""Maharaja"" is a testament to the brilliance of South Indian cinema. It is a film that demands to be watched, celebrated, and remembered. Mark my words and do yourself a favor-watch ""Maharaja."" It is a mandatory viewing for every cinema lover.""Maharaja"" is an absolute masterpiece that will leave you spellbound. Don't miss it!",9.0,FarhanJack,2024-07-17,0.0,0.0

1118224,No summary,"""Maharaja,"" directed by Nithilan Swaminathan and starring Vijay Sethupathi, is an engaging thriller that captivates with its suspenseful plot and stellar performances. The film follows Maharaja, a devoted father, as he navigates a web of mysteries to find a missing dustbin, ultimately revealing deeper, darker secrets.While the film excels in storytelling and character development, it unfortunately falls into a familiar and troubling pattern seen in many movies: using themes of sexual violence to drive the plot. This not only perpetuates harmful stereotypes but can also be traumatizing for viewers, particularly women. Such narratives often emphasize male heroism and female victimhood, reinforcing gender inequalities.It's time for filmmakers to move away from sensationalizing rape for dramatic effect or popularity. If sexual violence must be depicted, why not flip the script? Show a man being rescued by a woman, highlighting female strength and agency. This would offer a fresh perspective and help challenge societal norms.""Maharaja"" is worth watching for its unique plot and powerful performances, but it also serves as a reminder of the need for more responsible and empowering storytelling in cinema.

1118224,No summary,"Maharaja is a good example of how a generic template can be tweaked to create a compelling story if you are willing to experiment with the screenplay. Nithilan Saminathan's movie starring Vijay Sethupathi as the titular character is an extremely engaging thriller that presents the predictable and used-out elements differently to narrate a simplistic revenge story. With things going over the top very rarely, Vijay Sethupathi's John Wick-ish 50th film is consistently keeping you curious.Maharaja, our main character, is a saloon owner, and he has a daughter who is very active in sports events. His wife passed away in an unfortunate accident, and the iron dustbin that saved his daughter from that accident has a very important space in the life of the father and the daughter. At one point, when the daughter went out of the city for a sports meet, Maharaja got attacked at his house by a few masked men, and they took the dustbin. Maharaja took the issue to the police, and what we see in the movie is his resilient efforts to find the people who harmed him and took his Lakshmi (dustbin).",10.0,wwwarunpraneshrj,2024-07-15,0.0,0.0

The scene is masterfully shot, with tight editing and a powerful background score that amplifies the tension. Raja's character is established as a complex individual with a mysterious past, setting the stage for a riveting journey.One of the most impactful scenes in the movie is when Raja confronts the main antagonist, portrayed by Prakash Raj. The dialogue exchange in this scene is nothing short of electrifying. The verbal sparring between the two characters is filled with underlying tension and a sense of impending doom. Prakash Raj's portrayal of a ruthless and cunning villain is both chilling and compelling, providing a perfect foil to Vijay Sethupathi's stoic and determined hero.A pivotal moment in ""Maharaja 2024"" is the flashback sequence that reveals Raja's past.

Composed by Anirudh Ravichander, the soundtrack complements the narrative perfectly. The background score heightens the emotional impact of key scenes, while the songs are both memorable and integral to the story. The haunting melody of the theme song lingers long after the credits roll, a testament to Anirudh's musical genius.""Maharaja 2024"" also tackles several social issues, weaving them into the narrative without being preachy. Themes of justice, revenge, and redemption are explored through the characters' journeys, adding depth to the storyline. The film's portrayal of these issues is both thought-provoking and relevant, prompting the audience to reflect on the societal implications.The supporting cast delivers commendable performances as well. Simran, playing Raja's love interest, brings a sense of grace and vulnerability to her role. Her chemistry with Vijay Sethupathi is palpable, adding a layer of emotional resonance to the film. The ensemble cast, including seasoned actors like Nassar and Yogi Babu, contribute significantly to the movie's overall impact.In conclusion, ""Maharaja 2024"" is a cinematic masterpiece that elevates Tamil cinema to new heights.

1118224,No summary,"Maharaja (2024) :
Brief Review -Kollywood's answer to the Korean masterpiece ""Oldboy"" (2003). A classic action thriller with an extremely tormenting revenge theory. Most of the movie buffs in India are fans of Park Chan-wook's Korean masterpiece. We are not used to such action thrillers and revenge theories, and that's one of the main reasons why we love Oldboy. The amount of shock and the tormenting nature of revenge leave you disturbed and shattered. You might want to look at Maharaja as a mass action thriller, but since I have mentioned Oldboy, I am sure you'll look at it differently. Now, this is an advantage and a disadvantage too, because I have already given a big spoiler. Yet, Maharaja will leave you stunned because the spoiler is only the thin line over the dark prism you are going to discover. Oldboy with a mass action and deceptive formula, and your Maharaja is served. The intriguing narrative that unfolds events chronologically is indeed commendable. Indian cinema hasn't dared to think like Korean realism and torturing elements, and that's why we aren't making universally acclaimed action thrillers. So, hats off to Nithilan Swaminathan for thinking outside the box, bringing that unbelievable formula to regional cinema, and blending it with Indian emotional packaging. Maharaja starts off as a comedy, then turns into a mass action film, followed by a thrilling second half and tormenting revenge theories. This is how you make a revenge thriller with an unorthodox twist that sidelines all the mainstream factors in the first half. Vijay Sethupathi is the man of the hour. Take out his filmography and roles in the last 13 years and compare them with any other Indian actor. Vijay will beat every single competitor. Hands down to his gutsy choices of films and roles. Let's hail Swaminathan for making us believe that unusual classy-mass cinema still exists in the Tamil industry and that it's not just about mindless action films. Half a star extra for daring to think in that direction.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",8.0,SAMTHEBESTEST,2024-07-14,2.0,2.0

This movie ""Maharaja"" is none of it but still a lot more.It's raw, bloody, sick, maniacal....n bloody damn fantastic.A script that has everything going for it, music will keep u engaged, direction will keep u glued and acting will keep u wanting more.What starts off as a comedy ends in gore n blood. A movie which will keep u riveted to ur seat till the end, a movie which will make u cry, a movie which will make u laugh, a movie which will want u to avenge, a movie which will keep u guessing with its non linear story telling....n so on.We know what a fantastic actor Vijay Sethupathi is, what was even more heartening is Anurag Kashyap's acting. He just stole the show. Nothing to take away from Vijay Sethupathi but Anurag came as a surprise to me. Standing tall, shoulder to shoulder with Vijay and in the end he just stole it from Vijay. Hats off to all the actors. Everybody did their bit. Script, direction, cinematography, music , story telling and acting, all r top class. This year's best movie so far for me.Still in a daze...go watch it. Highly recommended.👍",9.0,narayanank-79401,2024-07-14,1.0,1.0

1118224,No summary,"When a film manages to grip its audience from start to finish, it does so through a combination of storytelling, direction, acting, and technical prowess. Each of these components plays a crucial role in creating an experience that is not just entertaining but also emotionally resonant and intellectually stimulating.Firstly, let's consider storytelling. A compelling narrative is the backbone of any great film. Whether it's a heartwarming drama, a thrilling action flick, or a mind-bending science fiction tale, the story needs to engage the audience's imagination and emotions. A well-crafted plot, with its twists and turns, keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. Characters that are multi-dimensional and relatable further enhance this engagement, making the audience care about their journeys and outcomes. When we become invested in the characters' lives, their struggles and triumphs, we find ourselves glued to the screen, eager to see what happens next.Direction is another critical factor. A skilled director knows how to pace a film, building tension and releasing it in just the right measure. They use visual storytelling techniques to convey mood and atmosphere, making every frame a piece of art. The director's vision is what shapes the film's overall tone and style, ensuring that all the elements come together in a cohesive manner. A seamless flow of scenes, where transitions feel natural and purposeful, contributes to the feeling of being ""stuck"" to the film, as if there is no better place to be than within that cinematic world.Acting, too, plays a pivotal role in maintaining the audience's engagement. When actors deliver performances that are genuine and nuanced, they bring characters to life in a way that feels authentic. This authenticity allows viewers to suspend their disbelief and immerse themselves in the story. Great acting can elevate a film, making even the most fantastical scenarios feel real and emotionally impactful.Technical aspects, such as cinematography, sound design, and editing, also contribute to the seamless experience. Stunning visuals can captivate the audience's eyes, while a well-designed soundscape can draw them into the world of the film. Editing ensures that the narrative flows smoothly, keeping the pacing tight and the story coherent. When these technical elements are executed flawlessly, they enhance the overall immersion, making it easier for the audience to lose themselves in the film.Moreover, the thematic depth of a film can add layers of meaning that resonate on a personal level. Films that explore universal themes-such as love, loss, identity, and redemption-often leave a lasting impact. They provoke thought and reflection, encouraging viewers to see the world from different perspectives. This intellectual engagement is another reason why a film might hold the audience's attention so effectively.Finally, the emotional journey that a film offers is perhaps the most significant factor in keeping viewers engaged. A film that evokes a wide range of emotions-from joy to sorrow, from fear to hope-creates a powerful connection with its audience. This emotional rollercoaster keeps viewers invested, making them feel as though they are experiencing the story alongside the characters.In conclusion, when a film ""kind of sticks you to it seamlessly till it ends,"" it is the result of a harmonious blend of storytelling, direction, acting, and technical excellence. Each element works in concert to create an immersive experience that captivates the audience's attention and emotions. Such films are not merely watched; they are experienced, leaving an indelible mark on the viewer's mind and heart. As the credits roll, the audience is left with a sense of fulfillment and a desire to revisit the cinematic journey they have just completed, proving the timeless power of great filmmaking.",10.0,sandeeppundir-46097,2024-07-13,1.0,1.0

1118224,No summary,"A movie universally praised by critics and audiences alike, and rightfully so. A marvel that has everything working in its favor.Story about a missing dustbin and a father's relentless quest to retrieve it. This seemingly trivial object holds immense emotional value for their family, a bond that transcends words. The film's core theme revolves around the unwavering love between a father and his daughter.The plot might sound absurd at first, but trust me, the less you know, the better your viewing experience will be. This movie is a rollercoaster of emotions, packing drama, action, suspense, and everything in between, all perfectly balanced to leave you wanting more. The brilliance of the script truly needs to be witnessed to be believed. The story unfolds in a non-linear fashion, jumping across timelines. While I usually find this technique confusing, here it masterfully builds suspense. With each jump comes a new twist that will leave you shocked.Vijay Sethupathi delivers a powerhouse performance in every frame, perfectly embodying the emotions of a father. Anurag Kashyap 2.0 is effective in his villainous role, but falters when portraying emotional scenes with his wife. Abhirami, despite limited screen time, shines in her character. The supporting cast, particularly the police officers with a special mention to Singampuli Annavi, deliver commendable performances as well.The film refreshingly avoids unnecessary lip-sync songs. However, the action sequences are brutal and gory, so parental discretion is advised. Prepare to be touched by the profound love between a father and daughter, a bond that will tug at your heartstrings.Director Nithilan Swaminathan has crafted a masterpiece that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The twists and turns will leave you baffled yet entertained. Missing this gem is a crime!

1118224,No summary,"I would divide the review in 3 parts:
1. Screenplay and Direction
The movie grabs your attention from the beginning itself. I will say the story is not new in fact we have seen hundreds of movies with this plot. What makes it special is its screenplay and presentation. The director presents the screenplay in a non linear manner which makes this simple story very gripping and creates a great suspense of the next plot. Also, all the characters are given a nice depth in the story.2. Acting and screen presence
VJS (Vijay Setupathy) I would say I watched very few movies of his but I am his fan since watching him in 96. He just delves into the given character such that you can't differentiate whether he is acting or someone is living that character. All other characters have played their role perfectly. I would like to mention the junior artist who played the daughter role is brilliant. The villainous characters will make you hate them. The police characters will appear as real.3. Conclusion
All the cinephiles should watch this masterpiece. The screenplay and presentation is fresh in Indian cinema.Ratings breakdown

Screenplay Masterclass. I have NOT seen anything written like this in Tamil cinema before.Any details about the plot may potentially reveal spoilers so I'll refrain from doing so. Vijay Sethupathi and Anurag Kashyap were GREAT (minus the lip-sync) along with the secondary characters. Any actor could have played these roles, from the Nassers to the SJ Suryas; but the screen presence that these two have elevates the scenes and the brand of the movie that will make people buy the tickets; and rightfully so - because a film like this deserves to be seen by many.But to put the actors ABOVE the script and the screenplay would be blasphemous. VJS will likely get over-credited for this movie and that's fine as long the writing gets the most props for this film. It would be an injustice otherwise.Is everything a 100% perfect? No. But the brilliance that the writing has demonstrated overshadows that things that didn't work for me along with a couple of the casting choices didn't have any impact on the plot. Could have been anybody, and folks who were chosen didn't add to the screen presence either. However this is not the movie to nitpick on.Go in blank, sit back and watch things unfold. You have not seen anything like this before. If you're a cinema lover, you're in for a special treat with the screenplay.",8.0,TreeFiddy53,2024-06-20,57.0,14.0
1118224,No summary,"Maharaja is a gripping thriller that weaves an intricate web of mystery. Directed by Nithilan Swaminathan, the film stars Vijay Sethupathi, Anurag Kashyap, Mamta Mohandass, and Abhirami. Here's what makes it stand out:Intriguing Plot: The story revolves around a mysterious accident where a lorry crashes into a home, altering lives forever. As the plot unfolds, we're drawn into a world of pain, mistaken identities, and gut-wrenching moments.Screenplay Brilliance: While the core story isn't entirely novel, the screenplay is where Maharaja shines. It cleverly conceals simplicity within deliberate complexity, keeping viewers engaged.Timeline Twists: The film shuttles between past and present, revealing crucial details bit by bit. Some violence in the first half may seem disconnected initially, but it all falls into place by the intense end.Character Dynamics: Vijay Sethupathi's portrayal of Maharaja and Anurag Kashyap's Selvam is hauntingly powerful. Their agony and struggles leave a lasting impact.Subtle Humor: Amidst the darkness, the film injects moments of humor. While some jokes work, others might feel out of place.Verdict: Maharaja is a unique revenge tale with terrific performances. Despite a few drawbacks, it's a must-watch for thriller enthusiasts. 👏🎥",10.0,Srjyreviews,2024-06-19,2.0,3.0

1118224,No summary,"Maharaja, directed by Nithilan Swaminathan of 'Kurangu Bommai' fame, is a remarkable film that will be remembered for years. This movie is particularly special as it marks the 50th film of Makkal Selvan, Vijay Sethupathi. Having such an outstanding film as his 50th is truly a stroke of luck and a blessing. Sethupathi's natural and versatile performance, where he fully immerses himself in a subtle role, is exceptional. While many movies are made for dustbin, here's one made around a dustbin. The film is packed with goosebumps-inducing moments, with twists and turns seamlessly integrated into the script. Natty shines in a prominent role, delivering a cool and stylish performance. Anurag Kashyap's deep voice and fitting body language provide a solid performance, especially in emotional scenes. Mamta Mohandas fades into the background due to the strong content, and Abirami makes a clean comeback. Bharathiraja keeps himself busy on the big screen, and ""Boys"" actor Manikandan excels as the villain, promising more future roles. Supporting actors Munishkanth, Aruldoss, and Singampuli also impress with their contributions. The dialogues are top-notch, and composer Ajanesh enhances the experience with an amazing BGM. The minimal yet powerful stunts add to the film's impact. Everyone involved in this movie deserves an A+.

And makes me to think how did Maharaja hide his feelings all these years by loosing his special one but instead pouring all the love, care, deep affection to ""USE ME"".

It helps if the same guy who wrote the brilliant script, directs and then the performances and technical aspects elevate it to the next level.VJ has played his part brilliantly by down playing his role. He is loud and intense where he has to be and silent and timid otherwise. Though AK as the main villian is great with his performance, the terrible lipsync doesn't help. Supporting actors have all done their job, but the police inspector and the surprise evil villian stand out. Abhirami, Mamta and Barathiraj have a lot less to show up for. The editing in such a non linear narrative can be tricky, but we have the best man in Philo for it. It is not too complex for the audience to catch but it makes them pay attention.The music was elevating but not distracting.South Indian cinema continues to dominate the art of film making.

1118224,No summary,"""Maharaja (2024)""Nithilan's ""Maharaja"" is the most satisfying film I've seen in recent times. The director, who also wrote the screenplay, succeeds in keeping me engrossed from beginning to end, constantly raising the question, ""What's next?""It's an ordinary story transformed into something extraordinary by the script and direction-a testament to Nithilan's brilliance. The non-linear presentation beautifully scripts the narrative, filling the audience with both confusion and excitement. It must be said that he also succeeds in creating characters with depth.Even when aspects of the story seem predictable, the question ""How?"" arises. When the writer provides an answer that surpasses our predictions, it signifies a writer's success. Nithilan has achieved that here. The shocking twists come one after another, and their presentation style is commendable.The film encompasses comedy, action, emotions, messages, thrilling elements, violence, etc. Everything is placed precisely where it should be.Regarding the actors, Vijay Sethupathi has made his fiftieth film superb. Such films are his forte, allowing him to portray his character with ease. Sachana Namidas, who played the daughter, delivered a beautiful performance. Most actors have done well in their roles; hence I am not mentioning everyone here.In other aspects of the film, Ajneesh Loknath has created the most suitable background music for the story. At no point did it feel excessive or insufficient.The sound design and mixing were also excellent.The fight scenes were impressive. Cinematography and editing are equally commendable. The art department, makeup department, and costume department have all performed their jobs impeccably.VFX is the only slight drawback at first glance. In one scene where Abhirami converses with Anurag Kashyap, his lip sync was off, which was noticeable.There are some lingering questions that seem to invite another viewing for answers._________________________________________
SPOILER ALERT:
Vijay Sethupathi's character is beautifully written. His love for his daughter and the lengths he will go to are evident from the beginning.He narrates a story at the police station and repeatedly tells it to make others believe it-reminiscent of ""Georgekutty"" from ""Drishyam."" Initially, it seemed that his daughter's repeated storytelling about ""Lakshmi"" was to emphasize Lakshmi's importance. However, by the film's end, it appeared to foreshadow his ability to retell a story convincingly-even to his own daughter.A lingering question is whether he had a backstory before his marriage; his strength suggests as much._________________________________________Overall, it's a well-written character that moves seamlessly through a clearly defined arc.My personal experience with the movie was highly engaging during my theater visit, leaving me completely satisfied. This review reflects my initial impressions; my opinions may evolve with subsequent viewings or changes in life perspectives.To any crew members reading this: please forgive any inaccuracies in my perspective.

1118224,No summary,"After Kurangu Bommai, writer-director Nithilan Swaminathan delivers a slow-burn emotional thriller that mostly works, courtesy of solid writing and performances. The screenplay is cleverly put together; several storyline threads are deliberately left open in the film's first half, only for them to be neatly tied together in the second. Every character, including that of Vijay Sethupathi's, gets more layering than you can foresee. The tonal shifts are almost sudden, but the transitions feel smooth. No time is spent on superfluous developments. Even the film's only major set piece (pre-interval) is smartly staged. I do wish sexual violence stops being used as a trope for the male protagonist to execute revenge in the most extravagant ways possible - that's the only aspect stopping me from giving it a 4.B. Ajaneesh Loknath strikes a meaningful balance between thrills and emotionally affecting bits of the film (especially in the second half) through his work on the score. Sethupathi (who exhibits subtle shades of the performer we all loved in his earliest days in Tamil cinema) is in fantastic form in his 50th outing. Anurag Kashyap also shines as the main baddie, with more texture to his character than usual bad guys - his lipsync is off though but the essence of the performance is saved by Philomin's edits. Nataraja Subramanian, Singampuli, Abhirami, and the rest of the cast contribute to the film in fairly memorable roles. Mamta Mohandas feels like an add-on, just to tick off a female presence during certain proceedings. What could've been a basic revenge plot gets subverted by its screenplay structure and non-linearity in presentation, resulting in a violent (and occasionally disturbing) yet supremely engaging 2h 30m affair. Due to my exposure to Korean revenge thrillers of the last few decades, the climax twist didn't SHOCK me.

That made me realise how brilliant is he in manipulating and encapsulating the viewers completely onto the big screen.The plot of the movie is related to a theft attempt at Maharaja's house and the police investigation and the events that follows forms the story.Nithilan has succeeded in setting background for family bonding,connection and emotions through the characters in the movie in the first half. I should say Nithilan is a magician skilled in playing with human emotions through his movies. Nithilan has showed the strength of the character Maharaja in the first half through Makkal Selvan's mannerisms and attitude.The first half of the movie was steadily paced with sudden surprises towards the interval that makes the audience thrilled to keep waiting for the later half.With the second half of the movie,Nithilan proved that the first half was just a beginning filled with many twists and surprises.The director is brilliant enough to develop a heroic image for a non human object through his movies as in his debut directorial.VJS has brilliantly portrayed the character and he has stamped and power sealed the 50th film in his filmography. Kudos to VJS for committing the movie.Anurag Kashyap has a special talent in shouldering antagonist image and he never fails to surprise and was simply outstanding throughout the movie through his attitude and performance.

1118224,No summary,"Maharaja (2024) Tamil movie Review: All I knew was that this movie is from the director of ""Kurangu Bommai"" that had been released in 2017, though it was a good thriller it didn't do that well. This is Nithilan Swaminathan's second movie after a gap of seven years. However, you get a feeling that this 50th movie or so of this already veteran director. Also, this one is in fact 50th movie of Vijay Sethupathi whose fan I had become after watching his initial movies starting from ""Pizza"". This one should be a case study of how screen play of movie should be written taking simplest of stories and how characters should be developed in the script. Any movie would be great if it doesn't allow you to guess what is going to happen next? The suspense should not only be edge of the seat, but it should have many wow moments that is beyond audience's wildest imagination. Also, it should be more than engrossing and not just that, it should take you along as the story unfolds on the screen. In such a way that you end up feeling that you are part of what is happening. Finally, it should make you think long after you return home. Maharaja does all that and becomes one of the best Tamil movies of this year and the best 50th movie for Vijay Sethupathi. Take a bow to the director Nithilan Swaminathan for creating magic with amazing screen play from a simple story. You will think it is just another simple story only when you get to decipher the complete plot of this amazing movie. And you may have to see this movie more than once to get everything that you witnessed in the first view. I am really glad that this movie just came when everyone thought Malayalam movies are doing great even with Tamil audience and everyone started asking, what had happened to Tamil movie makers as they couldn't cater to the requirement of Tamil speaking audience? So much was the impact that old movies were re-released in the theaters due to lack of any good new movies to compete with Malayalam to Tamil dubbed movies. Technically this movie is brilliant in all ways. The major technical success is the wonderful BGM by Ajaneesh Loknath of KGF fame. I always associate him with loud BGM that not only vibrates chairs of theater also makes you buy a bottle of Amurthanjan/Headache balm. However, this one is an exception and crisp editing by Philomin Raj. Coming to performances, Vijay Sethupathi stands out both playing the younger version (Whom I like most) and the older version with good make up and even mannerism. You will feel nostalgic about his character in the movie ""naduvula konjam pakkatha kaanom"". It is nice to see Anurag Kashyap's amazing performance though there is no lip sync at many places. That is just a minor glitch as you can't think of anyone else in that role. However, taking a comedian and make him play one of the lead bad guys speaks volumes about the director. Singampuli is just amazing, and you start hating him to the core. I can't take all the names as it would make this review still longer one. Yes, you can't forget the girl who plays Vijay Sethupathi's daughter in this movie. This one is one amazing movie of this year and perfect choice for Vijay Sethupathi's 50th movie. Very Highly recommended. Every Cinephile should watch this one.My rating is solid 10/10.One humble request :- Please don't reveal about the plot to anyone.

1118224,No summary,"As a connoisseur of thriller films, I found this feature to be quite the entertaining piece. The plot unfolds predictably with clues peppered throughout, allowing you to anticipate the twists from the onset. What sets this film apart is its adept use of non-linear storytelling, which compensates for the predictability and keeps you hooked. A notable departure from genre norms is the absence of an in-depth explanatory segment, which leaves some mystery intact. While the protagonist carries the narrative effectively, other characters, including the antagonist, lack substantial presence. Overall, it's worth watching.",7.0,jotheeswaran,2024-06-15,5.0,4.0
1118224,No summary,"A very engaging non linear thriller which goes back and forth on flashback without impacting the flow of the movie. But it has many problems beacuse of very predictable story, easy to guess screenplay by intermission and boring well grinded climax which has been filmed in many many such movies.. The director intension to take women centric movie including some child abuse concept but this is really given in a very very old bottle... The movie escapes through VJS acting as usual and some good acting from supporting characters... The police characters including Natti was the only twist which if the director had played upon more on the investigation making that as crux of story would have made it interesting instead of trying to push unnecessary sentiment.. Many important actors are wasted like the PT teacher character completely wastd could have been used better.. The bonding and emotion also could not stich well due to the poor story.",6.0,kaliyugram,2024-06-15,7.0,18.0

Cinema is one of the greatest forms of conveying a story. However, nowadays, stories are often diluted, and entertainment is prioritized. Fortunately, we now have a very sensitive story driven by Nithilan Swaminathan. Transforming a sensitive story into a screenplay without altering its emotions is not everyone's forte, but the ""Maharaja"" team has accomplished this with precision. The performances of Anurag Kashyap and Vijay Sethupathi have brought the characters to life. Their nuanced acting, combined with the screenplay, sheds light on shades of grey in human nature.

The Movie keeps you guessing throught the movie on what the hell is happening but how it all connects beautifully in the end is something of a masterpiece and the twists in this movie are awesome as well you won't get any of it. The movie is super fast paced from start to finish there is absolutely 0 lag. The Action Scenes are technically brilliant and choreographed in such a way that you truly feel every hit. Vijay Sethupathi's acting is top notch(needless to say) There are several scenes in this film which are clap worthy my favourite scene from the film has to be the scene between Natty and VJS at his home truly an amazing scene.

1118224,No summary,"Despite being critical of Vijay Sethupathi's filmography in the past (including Mugizh, 2021), I can confidently say Maharaja strikes a chord of undeniable brillaince for his 50th golden jubilee offering.There's so much to unpack in this film,
I'm still trying to wrap my head around everything, but major props to Sethupathi. He deserves a standing ovation for embodying the director's vision. The complexities, the writing is a no nonsense game which gets it right with a brilliant climax that lingers long after the credits roll. The first half features familiar faces from the director's debut, with lighthearted moments woven into the theft investigation, the police station chaos, and the antics of ""Kurangu Bommai,"" the burglar sidekick. Character introductions are swift, establishing VJS's family life, daughter, PT teacher role, the city's robbery, and the presence of Anurag Kashyap (whose dubbing might raise an eyebrow, but his performance shines in the climactic construction site sequence). For the sake of avoiding spoilers, I'll refrain from detailing his henchman's significance.Ajanessh Loknath, a powerhouse known for his work in Kannada and Telugu cinema is the perfect musical accompaniment for this movie.Director Nithilan Swaminathan, who stunned audiences with his debut ""Kurangu Bommai,"" showcases his mastery of non-linear storytelling, solidifying him as a rising force in Tamil cinema. His mastery of non-linear storytelling is brilliant. He's on track to be a big name in Tamil cinema.There's just so much to this movie, but for now, I gotta recommend it if you're looking for something deeper than just a masala popcorn flick. Sure, some might compare the climax to stuff like Oldboy or Irrata, or even Villeneuve's Incendies (2010), but don't let that stop you. Ignore the overzealous puluthis who act like they've seen it all - this is one you don't want to miss.Bonus recommendation!

1196470,No summary,"A Gripping, Realistic Apocalyptic Drama for a Selective Audience
This low-budget, apocalyptic movie stands out for its refreshing approach to the genre. By focusing on a family's survival story, led by a courageous female character, the film delivers a gripping narrative that eschews sensational disaster scenes and special effects.Shot on real locations, the movie's grounded realism immerses the viewer in the world of the story. The method acting is impressive, adding depth to the characters' struggles.While this film may not appeal to everyone, it will resonate with a selective audience seeking a more nuanced, character-driven apocalyptic drama. The pacing is well-balanced, making for a compelling watch.Overall, I'd rate this movie 3/5. It's not a masterpiece, but its unique perspective and realistic approach make it a worthy watch for fans of independent cinema.

Perhaps we've been watching too many films with a 7 rating that ultimately feel hollow, like ""Civil War,"" which I couldn't sit through. This film portrays human psychology in a very raw manner, showing both the weak and the strong as a result of their circumstances, rather than presenting them as superheroes capable of anything. It's an extraordinarily good film; frustratingly good, in fact.All the actors perform very naturally-nothing feels exaggerated or lacking. The characters include the annoying mother, the father, the bothersome son, and the selfish daughter, all depicted in a way that feels very real. The characters' foolishness and innocence are portrayed effectively, and the complex theories of destruction are simplified. The ending is just how it should be. Where else could it have gone?

There is no ""I'm not gona fall for the banana in the tail pipe"" level of humour, there is no ""Jonny wishbone"" hilarity, there is nothing in this movie except for throwing all the old characters together.

280180,No summary,"Despite Axel Foley being absent for 30 years, Eddie Murphy and producer Jerry Bruckheimer brought the wise cracking Detroit cop back for a special legacy sequel, for Netflix no less. Released in July of this year, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is a solid followup to the franchise and has rightfully earned some warm responses from critics and audiences. So having seen this for the first time, what makes it work in spite of it having come out way after the initial trilogy's run?The film follows Axel Foley returning to Beverly Hills after his estranged daughter Jane and his old partner Billy Rosewood's lives are threatened. As Axel tries to crack down a conspiracy behind the threats, he teams up with Jane's detective ex-boyfriend Bobby Abbott to help solve the case. Taking place three decades after the last installment is no easy task to break things down, but the filmmakers managed to keep the story concise enough without feeling as if too much time has passed by. Axel is still working as an officer yet his friends are either retired or have gone under different paths. Despite that, Murphy still pulls off the role well, blending the character's older age and experience with his trademark wise cracking personality that audiences know him so well for. Much of the film's funniest moments derive from how infamously famous Foley is around Beverly Hills and the numerous minor convos he gets himself out of using his streetwise smarts and charismatic energy. No matter how old Foley might get, his unconventional antics have not soured yet.Admittedly, the film's primary story is pretty standard as the typical tropes one would expect in a strained parent-child relationship are here as well. While Jane is established as similar yet unique from Axel and her reasons for resenting him make sense from her perspective, the chemistry she and her father share isn't all that interesting and she doesn't rise above the usual ""upset adult daughter"" trope. Fortunately, the addition of Bobby Abbott does make things more engaging as he ends up risking much of his own morals to aid Axel and Jane in the case, elevated by Joseph Gordon-Levitt's grounded yet concerned presence. That said, Kevin Bacon's character is surprisingly less interesting than one would expect, although he does his best in coming off as charmingly intimidating. Much of the other characters outside of recurring players are just typical plot fodder, and certain characters like Jane's client Enriquez and his uncle Chalino are forgotten as soon as their seemingly vital scenes are done. It's more fun to see the likes of Judge Reinhold, John Ashton and Paul Reiser back as their usual selves, but you just need to get through some uninteresting minor roles to see them shine again.In addition to the comedy, the action is a lot of fun to watch compared to the third film, although arguably not as punchy as the first two installments. Director Mark Molloy took full advantage of the feature's $150 million budget, as many elaborately staged truck / car chases are sprinkled throughout the right places. The editing helps out in many areas as the pacing can fluctuate between the mundane and the intense, showing how there's never a dull moment when Axel Foley is on the case. Much of the fun in these sequences come courtesy of songs used in the first two movies, especially ""Neutron Dance"" and ""Shakedown."" While these touches are clearly nostalgia oriented, they feel right at home here in juicing the action up further, along with some newer tracks like ""Here We Go!"" by Lil Nas X and composer Lorne Balfe's modernized rendition of ""Axel F"". As ordinary as the film's story is, these bits of playful intensity make the experience enjoyable enough to make up for the slower moments that could drag the movie down for some, and that alone should be worth something.So while arguably not as punchy or substantial as the first two installments, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is a vast improvement over the third feature in terms of fun and scale. Now that Eddie Murphy has garnered a decent renaissance for himself in the last few years, seeing a legacy sequel within one of his most popular film series turn out as decent as this one did means a lot in the long run. In honor of the first movie turning 40 years old and John Ashton passing away recently, this year is a perfect time to get back into the series. A welcome return this is indeed.",6.0,elicopperman,2024-11-02,0.0,0.0

Admittedly, it's all a bit faded, but finding Judge Reinhold, John Ashton or Bronson Pinchot, is nice, as is the character of Axel Foley, aka Eddie Murphy. There's a faded, old-fashioned feel to it, while retaining a certain charm, not of nostalgia, but of the satisfaction of rediscovering these first-degree chromos that were harmless, for example with shoddy villains, where the bad guys are defeated, without second degree, without excessive darkness. It's an anachronistic form in 2024, where hysteria, darkness and irony are basics. And for that reason alone, without being an artistic monument, the film works.But the film works, because it introduces the character of Axel Foley's daughter, as well as Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character, who are well seen, and enrich the script. The credited writing professionals (Will Beall, Kevin Etten and Tom Gormican) have done a good job of interweaving the various characters from the franchise plus the new ones, while remaining in its spirit, but updating it slightly.",6.0,norbert-plan-618-715813,2024-11-01,0.0,0.0

The film feels overproduced, with tons of money thrown into flashy visuals and a sleek look, but it completely misses the heart of what made the original movies entertaining.The attempt to modernize the story just didn't work, and the addition of the new characters, especially the black daughter, felt forced and ended up spoiling the storyline rather than enhancing it.The script feels heavy-handed, and the ""woke"" angle seemed like it was just tacked on, ultimately taking away from the overall vibe.

280180,No summary,"There's so much wrong with this it's hard to know where to start. But really it all boils down to Murphy/ you see, back in the day Murphy was a young, live wire, firecracker of a guy who was flying high. He was also a stand up who coukd think on his feet and ad-lib with the best. And that's how they made the original 2 movies. Eddie just cracking his jokes and doing his thing. What we have here is Murphy turning up to do someone else's script and take a pay check. There's no effort here. In the originals Murphy would have been firing lines and jokes all over the place. Here he just answers questions like a retired bank manager whereas before he would have moved the story along with a wisecrack. There's none of that here. It's as lazy as hell. They also spend far too much away from Foley, wasting it on 1 dimensional characters you couldn't care less about. The final nail in the coffin is turning Tagert into an asshole. But ultimately the whole thing boils down to Murphy's lack of performance and his inability to get involved in the script. In 1+2 there are countless Memorable scenes that have you grinning from ear to ear. Here he barely raises an eyebrow let alone hits us with some legendary wisecracks. Remember the scene in BHC where he goes to tge hotel and blags a room, saying he's a reporter for rolling stone etc? Well here he turns up at the same hotel and begins a legendary Luke and you think 'right, here we go. At last'... but then he just stops himself and says 'you know what, I can't be bothered, just give me the room at $900!' And thats it! That one scene sums up the entire movie... lazy lazy lazy.

280180,No summary,"Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is a sequel that best works as a redeeming factor to the franchise, a third instalment fans deserve, and not much else.The amount of returning cast members was both anticipated and unexpected, bringing back the actors for Rosewood, Jeffery, Serge, and somehow even Taggart. They're all great in their own rights, able to age their respectable characters to a suitable degree, especially Paul Reiser and John Ashton. Eddie Murphy is understandably the stand-out comeback as Axel Foley, still able to play the fast-talking detective almost as good as he could back in the first two films. The new cast mostly do a good job as well, with Kevin Bacon and Joseph Gordon-Levit offering really fun performances. The soundtrack is mostly borrowing from the first film, with a few new tunes thrown in, and the score feels suitably updated whilst keeping the awesome synth beats, unlike it's treatment in Beverly Hills Cop III. The story has some interesting aspects with Axel having a daughter, as well as hunting a cop-killer, offering up different circumstances to make this film stand out from the others in the series yet still belong as well. And the action is in line with the series' grounded-yet-out-of-control car chase and shoot out sequences, making some of the best scenes in the movie.On the other hand, I thought Taylour Paige was a decent actress, but her character Jane Saunders felt irritating moreso than relatable, as she continually let's her pettiness and anger towards Axel to get in the way of her own case. And Axel never seemed, or even seems like he'd ever be in a position where he's a bad parent, and so that b-plot was difficult to believe. Some of the actors, such as Rosewood and Taggart, are noticeably much older, and it borders on believability that either of them are capable of much, but this is more like a minor gripe.Overall, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F takes what works from primarily the first two films and offers a new and entertaining experience for fans of the franchise.",7.0,kademan-40962,2024-09-28,0.0,1.0

However, I approached it with cautious optimism, knowing that sequels or remakes released years later often struggle to capture the magic of the originals. To my pleasant surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed *Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F*. While it doesn't quite measure up to the brilliance of the first two films, it is definitely a step up from the third. Eddie Murphy delivers his signature humor and wit, reminding us why we fell in love with Axel Foley in the first place. Plus, seeing Judge Reinhold and John Ashton return was the icing on the cake, adding a delightful layer of nostalgia. This film manages to capture the essence of what made the earlier entries special, making it a must-watch for fans.

280180,No summary,"I really enjoyed this way more than I thought I would and it's nice to see I wasn't alone as user scores are around the 6.7-7 mark which is about right I feel. I gave it slightly higher for giving us great fan service right up until the final scene which had me nodding in approval. Granted the movie isn't perfect. The plot, while easy to follow is quite predictable and you figure out things mighty quickly in regard to who the bad guy is and how it's all going to pan out. Some of the film does call back to the cliched tropes of the days of olde action buddy cop movies too but I rather enjoyed those cheesy moments as some of those corny one liners actually landed too at times. It was so refreshing too to see 2024 Eddie Murphy bust out his 1980-90's Eddie Murphy jokes for this entry as well which is where most of the jokes that landed came from. I also felt that it delivered a nice father/daughter tale too that went on between Eddie Murphy and his estranged daughter. Lastly, the music which has been a staple for the series is all present and counted for from the Neutron Dance to the classic Axel F theme song and let me go in record for stating this fact. I adored how the iconic theme song started off as a subtle single chord bass track from the start of the film and then by the end of the movie evolved into the classic techno beat. That to me added a nice touch of class that I really appreciated. Overall this was probably the best entry in the Beverly Hills Cop series to date for me outside of the first film so if you're a fan of the films or just classic buddy cop action flicks in general definitely check this one out.",7.0,psgorio,2024-09-26,0.0,0.0

It was an easy-going and just all round a very easy watch. And that's exactly what a movie should be sometimes. And I found myself very much enjoying it. So let's review ""Axel F"".The sets are beutiful and stunning, the locations they chose to set the film in is wonderful, they have so many good-looking and grand places, especially Beverly Hills. Where it has the most Iconic scene with all the trees alining with one another, it set the scene and it's perfect.Eddie Murphy is perfect casting too. He has never failed to make me laugh, he's a scene steeler. But more so, Kevin Bacon. Who was great casting as the villain. He demands every scene he's in, and he gives us a great and charismatic performance as per usual with him.The story is very light, but it allows for some great scenes with our Characters, the daughter wants her father around more. And it sets up for a nice relationship with her, that these characters can then gradually build throughout the story. The depth is very serfice level but it's interesting enough that it can keep your attention.The action is very cool, the scenes they are in and where are characters stand or are in, does sometimes create for an edge of your seat action set-piece. Now what I mean by this, is the fact that a scene takes place, and our Character can fin themselves in a bit of a dilemma, where two gun man are right next to them. Which leads me to my next point, the tension building is very well done.As I said, this is a nice 2 hour's of your time, being an easy going experience. And that's exactly what this film offers. Some laughs, some great performances and casting choices, and some fun filled action. Turn off your brain and enjoy the ride!Would I recommend this film?I would, It's by no means perfect.

280180,No summary,I must have been watching a different film to the one seen by other reviewers on here as I found this film to be laboured and relying on a love of the 40 year old jokes in the original. The two hours of this film seemed incredibly long with some scenes dragging out and I just felt bored. Beverley Hills Cop when it came out in 1984 was a brilliant film. Eddie Murphy was unknown and hungry and along with his role in Trading Places cemented his reputation in Hollywood. The original film was slick and was reliant on good acting and comedy. Fast forward forty years and the new film relies on recycling jokes from the original film as well as high budget car chase scenes which just aren't needed in a film of this nature. The dialogue is laboured and scenes are drawn out for a thin plot which had no suspense. I finished this film feeling very disappointed.,1.0,adrianshawcross,2024-09-01,1.0,1.0

Foley sets off for Los Angeles, renewing many acquaintances and finding himself in the middle of a sinister conspiracy.The latest installment in the iconic Beverly Hills Cop series gives a powerful sense of nostalgia, particularly for the fans of the original films.

280180,No summary,"Beverly Hills Cop Axel F is the 4th film in the Beverly Hills Cop franchise and comes 31 years after Cop 3. Joining Eddie Murphy are the returning Judge Reinhold, John Ashton and Paul Reiser with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Kevin Bacon newly joining proceedings. The good points first...this is better than Cop 3, nostalgic throwbacks work well with original music from 1 and 2 integrated throughout, scenes reminiscing from the previous films including the final shootout at a house mirroring the climax of the first Cop and the chemistry between Reinhold, Ashton and Murphy is still there. Action scenes are good with no CGI to put us off, a particular highlight being the helicopter scene. Now the not so good.. the film is too long, clocking in at nearly 2 hours it doesn't feel as lean and fast paced as Cop 1 and 2. Murphy cannot wisecrack as fast as he used to, his scenes with his daughter are ok but there are too many of them and Bacon is given little to do. I think the biggest sin of the film is splitting Reinhold, Ashton and Murphy up for the duration. Cop 2 the best in the series was elevated by constant scenes of these 3 and by splitting them up this harms Cop 4. Reiser is also underused and has none of the chemistry with Murphy he had years ago in 1 and 2. From an entertainment standpoint Beverly Hills Cop 4 does just enough to get the series back on track. Jokes and action are good and the plot is solid. Cop 5 is rumoured to be in the works and in my opinion what they need to do is get the 3 central characters working together for the whole film and have a trim 100 minute run time. In the meantime Axel F is a good solid film which doesn't harm the franchise but i hope it provides a solid base to have a really great 5th film.",7.0,moviesareawayoflife,2024-08-18,1.0,0.0
280180,No summary,"Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is a disheartening attempt to revive a beloved franchise, failing on almost every level. The directing is so poor that it feels like watching a high-budget YouTube show, with acting that harks back to 80s sitcom mediocrity. The script is a disaster, riddled with unfunny jokes that try too hard.What's truly bizarre is the random and unfitting use of music cues and songs from the first two movies. The original films thrived on the 'fish out of water' dynamic-a Detroit cop navigating the luxurious world of Beverly Hills. This element, crucial to the series' charm, is entirely absent here, leaving a void where the heart of the franchise once beat.Eddie Murphy is too old for the role, and his performance needs to have the sharpness and wit that made Axel Foley iconic. Seeing him alongside Rosewood and Taggart, who are shadows of their former selves, is more sad than nostalgic. The chemistry that once sparked between these characters is gone, replaced by awkward attempts to recapture past glory.The film's laziness is epitomized in the car scenes, which look blatantly green-screened. Whether Eddie's return to Detroit or his arrival in Beverly Hills, the lack of effort is glaring and unnecessary.As a Gen-Xer with a soft spot for the original Beverly Hills Cop, this movie is painful to watch. It feels like a cash grab, similar to other recent, uninspired reboots. Even Kevin Bacon, who is usually reliable, is wasted here.Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is a snooze fest from start to finish, with a plot as generic and predictable as they come. It's a mess in every way-plot, dialogue, pacing. Nostalgia can only carry a film so far, and this one falls flat on its face. Eddie Murphy deserves better, and so do the fans.Ultimately, this movie feels like a middle finger to the audience-an uninspired rehash with no creativity or care.

280180,No summary,"In terms of long-dormant movie franchises that were never that great to begin with suddenly coming back, I suppose you could do worse than Netflix's revival of the Beverly Hills Cop franchise, bringing Eddie Murphy's Axel Foley back once more decades after his last, dismal effort. I mean, this isn't good, but it's not bad either. It doesn't have the breezy comedic air of the first or the extreme stylishness of the second, but it has a cohesive plot and efforts at comedy unlike the third.So, Foley (Murphy) is trying to zero in on some criminals at a hockey game when things go out of control and massive damage happens to the city of Detroit (how could anyone tell?). It's the last straw, and Axel's superior, Jeff (Paul Reiser), offers to retire to save Foley's job (I guess that would work to assuage his superiors instead of just firing Foley who did it?) and tells Foley to go connect with his daughter who is a public defender in...Beverly Hills. Of course! That is Jane (Taylour Paige) who popped out right after Beverly Hills Cop III, I guess. I kind of assumed that she'd be the daughter of Janice from the last movie, but it's unclear. Anyway, she's defending Enriquez (Damien Diaz) who's being prosecuted for a crime he says he did not commit. He was caught in a car crash that left a police officer dead, but he's being blamed for it. The MacGuffin ends up being an SD card with footage from the car proving him innocent, but it largely gets forgotten and Enriquez as well because the film is barely concerned with it.This is a return to the model of storytelling where the plot is a clothesline to hand Eddie Murphy being funny, and while Murphy is past his prime in terms of comedic potential, unlike the first film, he's still got some chops to make moments funny. However, that being said, there are other things to hang onto that plot, and it's mostly little subplots involving Jane and her ex-boyfriend Detective Bobby Abbott (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and his hidden history with helicopters. This is all happening while Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) is missing, having gone private detective and helping Jane with the investigation, pursuing the location of the SD card, and Taggart (John Ashton) has come back from retirement to be the police chief.And so the film moves from one bit of the investigation of the next with Murphy doing his, ""I'm going to instantly put on a new character and play that up until I get what I need"" to varying comic effect. The bit with a bit actor from Jupiter Ascending managing the desk at a car impound lot is mostly just kind of long (Foley hasn't seen the movie but has to act like he has which is...of limited comic potential). On the other hand is when the three meet up with Serge (Bronson Pinchot) and Foley acts like a rich father to the real estate agent of a big house which works a bit better.This is the second most competent film in the franchise when it comes to action sequences, and they're dotted through pretty evenly. The highlight is probably the second to last action bit with the main bad guy, police captain Grant (Kevin Bacon), who we've known is the bad guy pretty much from his first appearance, has Foley and Bobby arrested, but the pair get free to the roof of the building and Bobby has to pilot the helicopter up there. It's the special effects extravaganza of the film (honestly, not a huge extravaganza), but it's tied up with a character's little arc in comedic ways with the chopper flying at the deck while the two bicker. It's probably the height of the film.Plots get resolved in a big gunfight at the end, and subplots gets resolved in nice little ways like Foley and Jane making up their broken relationship. I mean, this wasn't a great throughline in the film. It was barely functional, but it was still functional and didn't break the film around it. It was fine.Which is a lot like the whole film. It's fine. The subplots are fine. The humor is fine. The action is fine. The plot is fine. There's nothing terribly exciting or hilarious or mysterious about anything going on. It's functional for two hours, giving fans of the franchise another look at Axel Foley well past his prime, and it's decent enough for that run time. There are far worse legacy sequels. There are also better.Eh. It's fine.",5.0,davidmvining,2024-08-16,0.0,0.0

280180,No summary,"The other night I watched the 4th installment of the Beverly Hills Cop series which is now streaming on Netflix. The film is directed by Mark Malloy and features our favorite characters from the first 3 films along with some newcomers including Joesph Gordon-Levitt and Kevin Bacon. In this movie, Axel is lured back to Beverly Hills when his estranged daughter's life is threatened, and the result is lots of laughs and the same whimsical actiony antics that we loved from the earlier films.I was happily surprised that I enjoyed this movie. Going into this, I was thinking that it would be similar to Coming 2 America where they only focused on the nostalgia aspect and forgot to tell a good story but fortunately, this was not the case for Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F. Of course, there were plenty of nostalgia pieces here, but screenwriters Will Beall, Tom Gormican, and Kevin Etten did a nice job of balancing that while still telling a funny and engaging story true to the original trilogy. The acting in this movie was really good specially form Gordon-Levitt and Bacon but Eddie Murphy truly stole the show. He brilliant as Axel which is so impressive considering he is reprising a role that he has not played in 30 years.They did a great job of bringing this franchise back to life and it has already been confirmed by producer Jerry Bruckheimer as well as Eddie Murphy that this will not be the final Beverly Hills Cop movie. I recommend checking this one out on Netflix and if you have not seen the first 3 films, they are all streaming on Paramount+.",7.0,MovieswDan,2024-08-11,2.0,0.0

280180,No summary,"Let's start with the name: the best they could do was ""Axel F"" ?? Why not ""Beverly Hills Cop 4: the Cash Grab"" ?? Sounds better, and is far more honest, as this is nothing but a cash grab for the sake of nostalgia. Everything that made the original BHC films endearing is gone. While it's nice to see Murphy, Reiser, Reinhold, Ashton, etc back on screen together, this comes off as beyond contrived. Not only are scenes from previous films retread, but they even used the same music. You mean to tell me they couldn't do a little better? This isn't a cheap plot to sucker in old fans for the sake of something familiar? Pfft.I'm not one to give a one star review when I don't like something, so my three star review is for the acting, the cinematography, and the editing - all of which are good. But everything else falls way flat - especially the writing.Which brings me to my last point. The previous BHC movies all poked fun at class, race, and gender respectively, and did so in an honest and organic way. This film does it in all the wrong ways. It is SO laden with ""the message"" that I couldn't even put it aside long enough to enjoy the film. The opening scene gets right into modern racial politics, and it goes from there. Every last thing that made the old films good and enjoyable is missing here. Just like many other reboots from the 80's and 90's (Bill & Ted, Indiana Jones, Jay & Silent Bob, etc) the Hollywood machine sucked out the heart and soul of this franchise for the sake of a SCS and to win points with modern audiences. The ""good"" people look mostly one way. The ""bad"" people look exclusively another way, and all nuance is lost. I really shouldn't have even given this sad thing three stars, but I do love the original films, and can respect what little this flick did get right. It's just a shame that an all star cast, great cinematography, and a solid editor can't get past a garbage cash-grab of a script that was churned out to be praised by people who weren't even alive when the original films were made. What an insult to longtime fans.Save your time and money on this one - at least if you have any affinity for the original films. This will only disappoint.",3.0,waywarddrifters,2024-08-09,1.0,4.0

Well of course there is, but this is not called the Detroit Cop now is it? And while I understand that some people are not too fond of most of the output we get served from Netflix, you have to give them credit where its due - one for making this sequel happening (Eddie did a TV movie a while ago, because he did not think this would ever happen) and two for making it so good.We get returning characters (yes it makes sense to have seen the other movies before this) ... but they are not just here to show off ... well that too, but they do serve a purpose. We also have quite the family reunion ... well we never really got to see Axels daughter ... now we get to see her as a grown up.The movie also manages to capture the spirit of the original ... having fun while watching it .. not the best action scenes, not the most thought of plot/story ... but it does work!

If you've ever seen a film of this ilk all of the story beats will feel familiar, but that doesn't stop it being fun. It floats along at a breezy pace and has plenty of energy to keep you on your toes.Eddie Murphy has lost a lot of his comedic brilliance, but he still cooks up a storm in this film. Axel Foley is just such a fun character and he plays him so well. The fact he is joined by returning characters from the original trilogy is fun, and new characters played by Taylour Paige and Joseph Gordon Levitt are good additions.If you enjoyed the original Beverly Hills Cop films or if you are just looking for a light and breezy watch for a Saturday night, Axel F will deliver.

280180,No summary,"For good and for bad, this feels just like an 80's action-comedy cop movie. Fitting, it is as advertised, it feels like a Beverly Hills Cop movie.Eddie Murphey's Axel Foley does all his greatest hits. He pretends to be another person in order to get into places he can't normally go. He participates in some car chases and shootouts. And there are witty conversations that usually consist of back-and-forth quips.The downside of this is all the negatives that come with this formula. At this point in time the same old stuff doesn't feel fresh. Within the same movie these hijinks grow tiresome. Foley does his gimmick of pretending to be someone in authority 6 times in the movie. He hijacks a vehicle for a chase 7 times, and the bad guys fire at him over 100 times and can never seem to hit a target.Compounded with the 80's action-comedy tropes, the movie throws in a parental abandonment storyline. I get 'why' they put it in the movie, it forms the emotional thrust of the story. But the storyline doesn't seem to fit Axel's character. Also, by this point, this parental neglect story has gotten really old. Every time the story stops to deal with this parental drama, the energy is drained.With all that being said, the humor is really good. Eddie Murphy is still just as funny as ever. The movie incorporates more action than the original film which only had a action scene at the beginning and ending. Kevin Bacon, Joseph Gordon Levitt and Judge Reinholt all feel like they are having a fun time in the movie, and that joy is contagious.Overall, Axel F gets a 'C'.",6.0,JayWolfgramm,2024-08-01,1.0,1.0
280180,No summary,"The cinematography and staging are extremely reminiscent of the 80's style prevalent when the first Beverly Hills Cop film was made. As the opening title sequence unfolds, one may begin to winder if an earlier installment of the series has not been queued up by mistake. The filmmakers admirably commit to this aesthetic for the entire movie, and that is arguably one of the most interesting aspects of the production. It's clear that some of the actors were well aware that they were now making a throw-back genre flick, and seem to relish roles as almost a parody of generic 80s TV cops and robbers. Much of the action choreography is also in this style which, on one hand, seems to cheapen the film somewhat, but on the other hand, if you see what they're doing, nails the parameters of the genre perfectly. The script gets a little boring with numerous in-car family reconciliation scenes. These scenes not only interrupt the pace of the film, but also get redundant because it feels like there are so many. I suppose the writers assumed that fans of the original Beverly Hills Cop were now likely to have estranged relationships with adult children, and this was kind of a message film for them... or something. The comedy mostly hits and there really isn't anything to think about.

And I enjoyed a bit of nostalgia served in both the comedy and action you'd expect from the series.The addition of the estranged daughter Jane serves as more as a plot devise to get the story going, but is also a key part of giving Axel some added humanity and heart that was fitting for the story and added layers to the motivation.It's not high art, but a good time if you can turn out your brain and just let the movie entertain you.",8.0,crazyburn87,2024-07-31,1.0,2.0
280180,No summary,"Here's my thought process when I heard there'd be another Beverly Hills Cops with Eddie Murphy. First came the happy feels. Then the question of why it was a Netflix exclusive and not theater bound. I start watching and I'm caught up in good vibes, classic music tracks from the series and an overall sense of nostalgia. Then this gives out and I'm like 'oh that's why it's on Netflix'. 'Axel F' isn't a complete loss, but we're a long way from greatness and largely skating on classic memories.In Detroit, Axel Foley (Murphy) still a cop foils a robbery, but things get messy complicating the life of former partner now Deputy Chief Jeffrey (Paul Reiser). Then the crap really hits the fan when his estranged daughter Jane (Taylour Paige) who lives in Beverly Hills and is a defense attorney gets neck deep in problems for a client. Trying to prove he's innocent of killing an undercover officer, she's enlisted the help of Axel's friend and former cop turned PI Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and Taggart (Ed Ashton) is now the Chief of Police.Good news is Eddie slides back into old comfort, but you can also tell he doesn't have the same energy his younger self did. His patterned Detroit Lions jacket is also put to use to hide him gaining a few pounds. Reinhold, Ashton and Reiser are fun to see back, but Taggart doesn't get to do much other than yell and Reinhold is barely in it. Happy to see Bronson Pinchot return as Serge. He's still a hoot and I always like Kevin Bacon as an actor even if he's saddled with an obvious one note role here. Much like Joseph Gordon Levitt as new character Det. Abbott who coincidently happens to be Jane's ex. Former SNL castmate Nasim Pedrad was the biggest burst of fresh air as an obnoxious Beverly Hills airhead real estate agent.I could harp on about what I feel is a needless family connection out of left field and sappy emotional moments between father and daughter, but they're just symptoms of a larger problem at play. 'Axel F' looks good, sounds good, but it's largely a bore. Laughs are sporadic, action rather mundane and the story 100% predictable. You know ... nostalgia is a funny thing. It brings out pleasant warm feelings, but this proved to me that it alone can't sustain a movie.

280180,No summary,"Beverly Hills Cop 4 is a good sequel to the original. This fourth sequel is easily better than the third and almost as good as the second.

But it was still good to see them. Axel Foley and John Taggart aged the least. Although they mellowed a bit and had more lines on their face, their performances had enough energy to give us glimpses of their old 80s self.Along with the original cast and music, the action and jokes made this film feel like a Beverly Hills Cop movie.

Eddie Murphy was 62 when he made 'Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F'. Think Tom Cruise, Will Smith, Liam Neeson, Gerard Butler, Russell Crowe, Harrison Ford...Yup, Axel Foley is back, and once again portrayed by Eddie Murphy - who first portrayed the character way back in 1984.

Enrique insists he has been framed, and now Jane is threatened with her life to drop the case.Our protagonist's main objective is to find an SD card that was removed from a camera in Copeland's car.

280180,No summary,"In my opinion this sequel to the Beverly Hills Cop franchise is kind of a wasted opportunity and a little bit of a disappointment really. The old Beverly Hills Cops movies were so good and part of the reason for their success was because they had great direction from established directors, the old ones were directed by such memorable names as Martin Brest, John Landis, Tony Scott, this one is directed by a man named Mark Molloy who I have never heard of and I learned this is his first movie he has directed! Seriously? Why trust such classic material as the Beverly Hills Cop franchise in the hands of a first time director, a complete unknown? I do understand this at all! You need to have experience to handle this kind of material. Such a waste it could of been so good. I think it would of been better if they had just left the series alone. It is not all bad but as a sequel to Beverly Hills Cop they should of done so much better in my opinion, I do not feel the nostalgia I wanted to and, Joseph Gordon Levitt is in this, he is not a bad actor but he was not in the original and it doesn't feel like classic Beverly Hills Cop to me.",4.0,TheFriendlyCrocodile,2024-07-23,2.0,1.0
280180,No summary,"Marginally just marginally better than BH3 which is not saying much. The positives are the music is a great throwback to the first two films & Eddie Murphy is funny & carries the film.The negatives are the acting is so bad from everyone even Kevin Bacon & JGL who are good actors. It's due the script just being so poor with a storyline that's wafer thin. The action sequences are boring, non engaging & directed so poorly. The film has some comedic highlights but when the film tries to get serious in it's action sequences they try too hard to be funny whilst the action sequence is happening taking away any real drama or effect.This is what the first 2 films did brilliantly, they were funny when they needed to be but when the action happened it was serious, gritty & hit u hard. The first 2 films also benefited from much better scripts, much better acting & much better directors in Martin Brest & especially Tony Scott.",4.0,reggieltd,2024-07-23,4.0,1.0

After the disappointment of the 3rd film, which having rewatched recently, I can confirm is still as bad as I remember back in 1994. When I heard that a 4th film was finally being released, I was a bit unsure whether this would be any better, especially after all the false starts and rumors. However I am happy to say that right from the beginning my concerns were wrong. It isn't perfect by any means, the storyline lacks a little bit of development and it probably relies too much on all the references to the 1st and 2nd films.",7.0,andrew-porter75,2024-07-18,1.0,1.0

It was a huge blemish on an otherwise fun movie series.So, I was glad when Murphy decided to return for one more movie and this time, he really did the character justice. Unlike other legacy sequels, it doesn't waste time by making the main character miserable. Yes, Axel still has a few problems here and there, but he is otherwise the same guy we last saw thirty years ago.Also helps that the rest of the returning cast has fun being there, just as the new additions, who make sense and play off each other well.Does it have shameless fan service? Oh, very much so. I really didn't mind that here. It's was fun having a few callbacks.Way better than 3, on a level with 2, with 1 being the absolute classic standard.",7.0,c-mutig,2024-07-23,1.0,1.0
280180,No summary,"Of all the reboots, remakes, and nostalgia-latent projects that have been thrown at us in the past two decades, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F, is one of the better ones.Eddie Murphy is fine form as he reprises the role that catapulted him into a movie stardom. It was fun to see much of the original cast return even for a scene and even if they look like they've had some hard years in the 20 years since we last saw Axel Foley on screen.The negatives however are a bit glaring.The opening action sequence is clearly a callback to the opening of the original film, however it is inferior in every way. The plot is by the numbers and even though they try to give the audience a twist, that twist is obvious, especially with the casting. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is enjoyable, but it is hard to not feel as though he feels out of place as the new ""buddy.""Overall this is a fun film, don't expect to be wowed by something new, but it is entertaining to watch Murphy do what he does best: cuss up a storm while manipulating everyone he encounters.",7.0,davidshirley,2024-07-23,0.0,3.0

It's the type of film back in the day you would see all the time, simple fun action and a way to pass a couple of hours without preaching. Murphy does seem a bit sluggish at first but comes alive the more the film progresses and his scenes with Serge are the best in the film when you can literally see the old fire and sparkle in Murphy's eyes come back as he improvises and riffs with with Bronson Pinchot. If we get a BHC 5 we need more Pinchot and that clear chemistry they have.Like all resurrected franchises it does pull out the 'member berries' but they are good intentioned rather than cheap gimmicks such as a photo of foleys original chief from BHC1 on the wall at chicago PD etc.The story with his daughter was good and just about managed to avoid falling into the ""you're old"" ""you're past it"" ""let me show you how it is done old man"" tropes that modern hollywood seems to think endears new characters to audiences in established franchises.Just switch off the brain and enjoy it with a takeaway it's a good way to spend an evening.",7.0,chikawowow,2024-07-22,2.0,2.0

And for that, the father-daughter relationship doesn't feel solid.The scenario goes in line with the classic Beverly Hills cop, although the action and demolition can often be heavy handed, specially for older guys. The not so smooth transition from one location to another and the multiplicity of characters makes the movie feel overly complicated.But I'm glad that the vibes of a bygone era have been brought back, and don't feel out of place in the world of today.

The cameos were expected, the characters were great, and aside from a couple gags, the member berries were kept at a minimum.Joseph Gordon Levitt and Kevin Bacon were a great addition to the cast.

Taylor Paige could not have been more of a sand bag weighing down the story. Kevin Bacon was so excited to work with Eddie, he over acted and became unbearable. I'm sure, his star status bullied the writers and director into giving him the predictable story arch he had. Other than the same fun as eating a bag of White Castle at 3AM, this picture should never have been greenlit. I'll give it 10 stars for productiion value alone.

280180,No summary,"Axel Foley returns to Beverly Hills after his daughter Jane and his old partner Billy Rosewood's lives are threatened. She and Axel team up with her ex-boyfriend Bobby Abbott and his old pals, John Taggart and Serge, to uncover a conspiracy.In true 80s fashion, it's a paint-by-numbers outing, but director Mark Molloy successfully taps into nostalgia, while offering a few surprises, delivering a welcomed return for Axel Foley. Noticeable from the start is that it's not sugar-coated for an age rating; like the old days, it pulls no punches in terms of violence and expletive language.Eddie Murphy returns in his barrier-breaking signature role. Thanks to Will Beall, Tom Gormican, and Kevin Etten's writing, Axel feels like Danilo Bach and Daniel Petrie Jr.'s character from the first and second films (which the third lacked with a generic script). Kevin Bacon as Captain Cade Grant is on top form, and the returning cast, including Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Paul Reiser, and Bronson Pinchot, are excellent. Although Gil Hill and Ronny Cox don't appear in the film, they are seen in photographs. Luis Guzmán gives an extended cameo. New likable characters include Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Taylour Paige, who add a little energy.From beginning to end, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F has big action sequences. Yes, they're older, but like the callback music by Lorne Balfe, it has the charm.

280180,No summary,"""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F"" (2024) revives the beloved franchise with a fresh yet nostalgic twist. Eddie Murphy returns as the irrepressible Detective Axel Foley, bringing his trademark wit and charm that fans have cherished since the original 1984 film. This time, Axel finds himself embroiled in a high-stakes investigation that bridges Detroit and Beverly Hills, deftly blending comedy with thrilling action sequences.The film successfully balances modern filmmaking techniques with the essence of the original series. Director Mark Molloy manages to capture the vibrant energy and comedic timing that made the first movie a classic, while updating the narrative to appeal to contemporary audiences. The script, penned by Josh Appelbaum and André Nemec, weaves in clever references to the original films, delighting long-time fans, while introducing new characters that add depth and freshness to the story.Murphy's performance is a standout, as he effortlessly steps back into Axel's shoes, delivering punchlines and performing stunts with the same vigor that defined his earlier portrayals. The supporting cast, including new additions such as Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Taylour Paige, provide robust performances that complement Murphy's, ensuring the ensemble cast contributes meaningfully to the film's dynamic.The film's production values are top-notch, with sleek cinematography capturing the contrasting worlds of Detroit's gritty streets and Beverly Hills' opulence. The action scenes are well-choreographed, offering a mix of suspense and humor that keeps the audience engaged. The soundtrack, featuring a modernized version of Harold Faltermeyer's iconic ""Axel F"" theme, injects the film with an electrifying sense of nostalgia.While ""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F"" doesn't deviate significantly from the formula that made the original a success, it is precisely this adherence to its roots, coupled with thoughtful updates, that makes it a hit. It's a delightful blend of action and comedy, offering both a satisfying trip down memory lane for fans of the franchise and an entertaining experience for newcomers.In conclusion, ""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F"" (2024) is a triumphant return for Axel Foley, delivering laughs, thrills, and a hearty dose of nostalgia.

280180,No summary,I had to rewatch the first one because I couldn't remember most of it and wasn't completely sure I had seen it all the way through. Anyway this one was predictable and does a number of callbacks to the original which is what this is about I guess. I enjoyed it for what it is and Eddie brought back his quick witted humor which was refreshing since he's been in so many kid movies over the past 20 years or so. You see the villain and plot coming from a mile away but Bacon is solid as always and Gordon-Levitt was a decent sidekick. Taggart and Rosewood are back and looking pretty rough but they slid right back into their roles. Decent watch but definitely not a must-see.,6.0,pd-19490,2024-07-15,1.0,2.0

280180,No summary,"This is one of the better legacy sequels and at least better than the third movie. It's a fun movie to watch that brings the classic gang back together. Though it's a lot of just copying the better movies.There's not a lot new, even the music is just the iconic stuff from the first two. The Heat-style shootout and the helicopter chase are both standout sequences and offer something different.Eddie Murphy is still in top shape. He easily slides back into the role, though he's missing that iconic laugh. He can still effortlessly talk his way out of anything. It's nice seeing both Rosewood and Taggart back, the latter skipping the third movie. They too slip easily back into that banter that made them so lovable. It's just a shame that Judge Reinhold and John Ashton look really old, and they spend too much of the movie apart.Paul Reiser is good, though he's saddled with trying to do Gil Hill's Inspector Todd role. Bronson Pinchot is always fun, but like the third movie he isn't necessary.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the best new addition. He feels like the kind of modern version of Rosewood the story needs. He's got some great banter with Axel.Taylour Paige is fine in her role as Axel's daughter. But the character is burdened with the kind of legacy character's child story every single other movie has done. Why does every studio feels the need to make every lovable character into a terrible parent? Han Solo, Laurie Strode, Indiana Jones. Do all Hollywood writers need to talk to a therapist about their parental issues?Kevin Bacon does his usual good work as the head of gang of corrupt cops. But his character is the most forgettable villain in the series.It recaptures the magic better than most, but it still is a few decades late.",7.0,ARTaylor,2024-07-15,2.0,3.0
280180,No summary,"Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is a good legacy sequel that brings the spirit of the original movies back to life, making sure the franchise didn't end on the garbage fire that Beverly Hills Cop III was.Eddie Murphy makes Axel Foley a fun character again, recapturing the charm and energy that made the original movies so beloved. The film brings back some nostalgia without over-relying on it.However, I was disappointed by the underutilization of Rosewood and Taggart. The chemistry between these characters and Foley has always been a highlight in the series, and its absence in significant parts of the movie is noticeable.Additionally, the daughter's storyline was pretty basic and fell flat for me. The chemistry between both actors wasn't really there, making me feel like she wasn't really Foley's daughter.But like all Beverly Hills Cop movies, the soundtrack will be stuck in my head for weeks to come.",7.0,lordtibo995,2024-07-14,4.0,2.0
280180,No summary,"Alright, folks, buckle up for my take on **Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F** (2024). It's like a roller coaster that's fun but kind of predictable-you know every twist and turn but scream anyway because it's what you're supposed to do. Eddie Murphy brings Axel Foley back with his trademark swagger and quick quips, but it feels like catching up with a high school buddy; nostalgic, slightly awkward, but you're glad they're doing okay.The plot? It's as safe as milk. Axel zips around Beverly Hills cracking jokes and busting bad guys with a story that won't shock anyone who's seen more than three movies in their lifetime. There's the usual cocktail of car chases, shootouts, and that classic Axel Foley banter that can still pull a smile from the grumpiest viewer. But let's be honest, it's like reheating last week's pizza-satisfying, but missing that fresh magic.So why the middle-of-the-road three stars? Well, it's the cinematic equivalent of comfort food. Sure, it's not going to win any gourmet awards, but sometimes you just need that familiar flavor. Murphy and the gang, including newcomers like Joseph Gordon-Levitt, keep the ride amusing enough to stick around for the credits. It's the perfect movie for a lazy Sunday afternoon when you want to turn off your brain and bask in the warm glow of the good ol' days.",6.0,natmavila,2024-07-15,1.0,3.0

280180,No summary,"BHC: Axel F is just another basic nostalgia-fueled product. Produced and packed for your convinience, containing only the things you remember plus the tired actors after a dust off and clean up, mediocre storyline and action film structure of today (intro action scene, boring, mid action scene, boring, big action scene, end).Axel F features some variety as these products go. Where Indiana Jones with a 90 y.o. Ford still managed to go full insanity in the last act, providing some good laughs and entertainment - Axel F drives through the story road on a golf cart with no fresh ideas, constantly hitting all the possible cliche bumps. The main villain is so incredibly obvious makes you wonder how is he able to work at the department at all for all these years. Every plot development in the film can be seen a mile away so there's no reason to set your mind for something interesting, not happening.Why was it so hard to introduce at least a half of a twist to make the story interesting? I don't know. They dedicated more time to re-enacting scenes from the older films than developing something new. Classic producer thinking: ""Is this character's actor still alive? Ok, bring him in, write him into the story, even if it makes no sense.""There was a good portion of action in the film, but shot and edited poorly, with lots of green screens, distinguishable stunt doubles and more. I understand that Murphy is just a human being and cannot be as fast and furious in his 60ties as he was in his 20ies, which is prefectly fine. You can even see that in some scenes where we would've seen him running, it was just a hard cut with teleportation. Although I have no idea how you can use such a chunky budget and get a result like this. This didn't feel like a 150m film, to be honest.And one more thing. Murphy's character has changed through the years, which is fine, but I'd argue that he hasn't changed enough or went into an interesting direction. He's still as much fun as he used to be, but in the older films you could see how smart and professional Axel F was behind that smirk. A talented and persistent street-smart detective, which was a cliche even at that time, but Murphy's charisma covered this. Here he feels like a parody of former self, and is taken as such by everybody else. He's very funny at times, but there was no way you can look at him and say ""yeah, that's the classic Axel F"".So, in the end, BHC: Axel F is sill a mass-manufactured producer product. The best thing about this film is that most of the actors from older movies are still alive and well, so they and the crew got paid for this. Which I'm perfectly fine with. Other than that - mediocre even by Netflix standards.I was mildly entertained wacthing Murphy doing Axel F, he's still a great performer and actor, although at times he looked sad and tired.If you loved the old films (even the third one), you'll probably still watch this, but forget it exists very fast.

""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F"" was a nostalgic trip down memory lane, and writers Danilo Bach, Daniel Petrie Jr. And Steven E.

Eddie Murphy still has that particular charm that he pulled off so nicely back in the 1980s and 1990s, and it carried the movie quite well.There is a good pacing to the storyline, especially because the movie starts out in a high gear and never really slows down.I have to say it again, if you enjoyed the first three movies, then watching ""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F"" is a must.

What works in Beverly Hills Cop IV? Let's take all of the main elements, one-by-one...The Story - This works nicely as a nod back to the kind of stories we used to get, with a little bit of everything. You've got character building, taking into account the jump in time, but it's all balanced with a mix of action, light-hearted mystery and a dash of nostalgia. Too many movies trade enjoyable bursts of action for overly-long, over-the-top action. Beverly Hills Cop IV keeps the balance as it would have been in the old days. It shows how the action doesn't _need_ to go over the top or last forever, if the characters, fun, and story around it build up to it well and make you care what happens. The villain is very old-school in his motivations and perfectly fitting, though I would say he was the only thing that could have been fleshed out a little both in terms of back story and what he was doing.The Characters - Again, it's a good mix. Not only do we get to see the characters we loved from the originals, but the new characters get to add to the story without detracting from it. It would have been easy for the older characters to be throwaway nostalgia, but instead they are thoroughly integrated into the story.The Cinematography and Editing - The director, cinematographer and editors did a good job of matching the kind of look and feel of the old movies. The camera moves and angles like a film from the 80s, and likewise the editing does a good job of keeping the pace without all the fast-cuts we've become used to. Once again, it shows that if you do it right, you don't need all the modern excess to try and hide what's lacking or overcompensate.The Music - Lorne Balfe does an excellent job of filling in for Harold Faltermeyer. He manages to keep the tone and atmosphere consistent with the originals, without adding too many modern touches.The Comedy and Nostalgia - Again, the right amount is used. We, the viewer, want to enjoy the nostalgic nods to what came before, to honour its origins and established characters. But, if that's all it relies on, then it will still be disappointing. Instead, it doesn't dwell on the nostalgia, it merely peppers the film with moments that will add a grin to the faces of the old fans. Likewise, the comedy doesn't override the story and characters but, as with the originals, it keeps everything fun and light-hearted and even includes some genuine laugh-out-loud moments.What can I say? I'd heard and read a few things that made me think this was at least going to be 'okay', but I was pleasantly surprised at just how good it really was! It did a great job of capturing the comedy, adventure, and atmosphere of the originals, without drowning in nostalgia.",9.0,warren-87235,2024-07-12,4.0,1.0

Kept waiting for Axel's signature laugh and it never came. Thought maybe it would end with it, but not at all. Read up on it to discover that Eddie Murphy didn't like to be pigeon holed and therefore trained himself out of that laugh. That's well and good, but the character was known for it and so it was screamingly absent. Apparently there is a fifth instalment in the works.

It's all about the journey of father and daughter, the daughter doing the planning and the father doing the action. In this journey, they will have an argument from their past - family story and their case which they are trying figure out and from that they can find the answer for their problem and fix them and make them back together.",6.0,phamduclong-64542,2024-07-12,0.0,2.0

280180,No summary,"Beverly Hills Cop was one of the funniest comedy action movies of all time. I think it managed to beat off one US box office record that the 1997 release of Titanic could not sink.It also cemented Eddie Murphy's megastar status. Unfortunately the sequels could no match the original's success.Of course it is unlikely Axel F would still be a cop 40 years later. He would either be retired or dead.This fourth instalment has Axel still a Detroit cop causing trouble.

Suspension of disbelief is one thing but to have the same actors, some of then clearly in their seventies (at least!) trying to pretend they're still Police Officers after what must be nearly 50 years of service for some of them, just doesn't work. By all means have the old characters retired and meet up to solve a case or two, but NOT as Serving Officers after so long; in fact it was really sad, as if someone had opened the door to an Old Folks Home and said: 'Let's pretend it's 1984 again and we'll all try to be young'. The plot was... okay... Axel has / had a family and now rediscovers his daughter, who of course is a Yuman Roights ""the criminals are really all innocent and the Police are all bullies who never study the evidence"" type who works for free cos it's the great thing to do in movies. It really became a case of waiting for the next cameo and like myself, some of the old faces have NOT weathered well in time, and of course, it really became a case of ""let the next generation rescue the old crocks as they can't hack it any more"" sort of thing. It made me feel old, and useless, and realise that things really have moved on since then, and I sat through it as a kind of bittersweet experience.

Being a fan of the first two Beverly Hills cop movies, I hoped this would at least be fun. It was terrible. Other than some funny, one liners from Eddie Murphy and using the original soundtrack, it wasn't funny, exciting and certainly was not realistic. Things like getting pepper sprayed multiple times in the eyes and mouth and then two minutes later being able to see fine is just silly. It seemed to clear indication Netflix was desperate to bring back the original characters and did not have any concern in the screenplay. I had to turn it off at the very end it was that bad.

280180,No summary,"A decent re-emerge from a franchise that was always being speculated about.It should've happened many years ago but surprising to see Eddie Murphy and the original co stars back in action from the original movie which was great and pleasing.As much as this is an entertaining movie I think the entrainment may be decided by generations. For those, who have seen the original movies, know when it was originally released there was new comedic entertainment, touching new boundaries and it made you laugh! The second part was a little more serious but even then was decent with new ideas and enjoyable whilst the third part took a decisive turn with a different direction and most likely didn't meet everyone's expectations.30/40 years later (depending on which movie you're referring against) pops along part 4 which many hardcore fans have been waiting for. More importantly while many might have known there was a brief mini series with Axel retiring there wasn't much noise from it and certainly didn't mention anything from this point.Incoming BHC4 and whilst it seemed positive, did it feel it was more of a remake of part 1 with a few questions or even advanced staging..... For me, yes. Perhaps for those who have seen the originals. Although certainly seems to be attracting a new generation.The movie itself was a great relief to have the original characters back however much of it felt like a revamped BHC 1 with new additions. Overall the movie is enjoyable but is it really one for the those who have seen the original? Or is this a platform for a new upcoming BHC 5/6....? Only time will tell.Enjoy the movie for what it is but don't expect a large new comedic lines but from what it is, it'll certainty rekindle some memories especially for those who watched it way back in the 80's.",5.0,EssCeee,2024-07-11,3.0,1.0
280180,No summary,"""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F,"" the 2024 installment in the iconic franchise, brings back Eddie Murphy as the wisecracking detective Axel Foley. The film attempts to capture the charm and humor of the original series while updating it for a modern audience.Murphy's return as Axel Foley is undoubtedly the highlight, and his comedic timing remains sharp. The film is filled with nostalgic nods to the original, including the catchy ""Axel F"" theme music, which is sure to please long-time fans.However, while the film delivers laughs and action, it struggles to find a balance between the old and the new. The plot feels formulaic at times, relying heavily on callbacks rather than introducing fresh ideas. The supporting cast, though competent, doesn't always mesh well with Murphy's dynamic presence.Overall, ""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F"" offers a fun, albeit uneven, trip down memory lane.

280180,No summary,"Nostalgia is a powerful thing. If you grew up watching the Beverly Hills Cop movies, this really hits a Home Run! Axel Foley the wisecracking, street-smart detective, is back in action, and it's like welcoming an old friend. Eddie Murphy effortlessly slips back into the role that made him a household name, bringing with him the same charm, wit, and energy that defined the original films. The humor is sharp, the action sequences are thrilling, and the storyline, though familiar, is a delightful throwback to the golden age of 80s action-comedy.What makes Axel F stand out is its ability to balance the old with the new. The film pays homage to its predecessors with numerous nods and references that long-time fans will appreciate, yet it also injects fresh elements that keep it from feeling like a mere rehash. The supporting cast is excellent, with both returning characters and new faces adding depth and dynamism to the narrative.The soundtrack, another hallmark of the original series, is vibrant and perfectly complements the high-octane scenes. The iconic theme gets a modern update, yet retains its classic feel, instantly transporting viewers back to the heyday of Beverly Hills Cop. The cinematography is slick, capturing the glitz and glamour of Beverly Hills while juxtaposing it with the gritty reality of Foley's Detroit roots.Murphy's comedic timing remains impeccable, and his chemistry with the rest of the cast is electric. The film manages to maintain a light-hearted tone while also delivering moments of genuine tension and drama. The dialogue is peppered with clever quips and memorable one-liners, making it a joy to watch from start to finish.In conclusion, Axel F is a triumphant return to form for the Beverly Hills Cop franchise. It's a movie that understands and respects its legacy while also embracing the need to evolve and adapt. Fans of the original films will find plenty to love, and new viewers will be introduced to the infectious charisma of Axel Foley. It's a fun, entertaining ride that captures the spirit of the 80s while firmly planting its feet in the present day.",9.0,robertmatthewking,2024-07-11,4.0,0.0

There was enough comedy to make you laugh on occasion and enough action to keep action fans happy, though it naturally featured people with automatic weapons not being able to hit the broad side of a barn and it pretty much followed a very familiar formula. I will say the Judge Reinhold looked a little odd.

When I heard a 4th one was coming, 30 years after the last one , I assumed it would be terrible especially with a Netflix release. It isn't and worth your time. Forget about the plot...you have to in most movies and this one is no different. It was fun to take this ride again. It helps that Eddie only looks slightly heavier and they don't require him to do much action so his character is believable. Rosewood and Taggert look their age and you just have to look past it. It's funny and the added characters work well together. I watched it last night and barely remember it already but enjoyed it while I watched.",7.0,DGMcCready,2024-07-10,0.0,4.0

280180,No summary,"I've always loved Eddie Murphy since I was a kid and I've been happy to see him recently in good movies such as. Dolemite Is My Name and You People. This 4th chapter of Beverly Hills Cop is nothing near the first one, of course, but it's enjoyable. I loved hearing the iconic soundtrack at the beginning, but throughout the movie it got annoying: why would you use (almost) the same soundtrack after 40 years? I would have preferred to find new music giving those kinda vibes. Judge Reinhold has a few screen time and I think that's because of plastic surgery who made his face (and lips!) hard to watch on screen. I think fillers messed up his acting skills. But his performance is not the worst, the real problem is the actress playing Eddie Murphy's daughter: she is so plain it's embarrassing. It's not sufficient for her to cry at the end of the movie: crying doesn't make you a good actor. I never believed her throughout the movie, not once: she failed to convey the right emotions. When they try to kill her she looks as if a spider had entered the car! They're trying to kill you, for Heaven's sake! Both you and your dad! I don't wanna spoil anything so I won't say more but seriously... she was bad. I mean, REALLY bad. Thank God Jason Gordon Lewitt is a master at conveying emotions and a great casting choice. He definitely helped making the over the top scenes believable.I missed Axel Foley's laugh!!!! I thought at least at the end he would give us that signature laugh but he didn't.Eddie Murphy is still charismatic and (I'll admit it, I'm a fan) so enjoyable in the role.The story has many clichés (crazy good cop having a hard time raising his daughter... rings a bell?) but it's part of the 80s vibe. Too bad the actress playing the daughter was so bad. I know, I already said this, but seriously, I can't get over her bad acting. Overall, the movie could have been funnier, but it's definitely worth watching on a Sunday afternoon/evening....and it will leave you singing that iconic tune in your head! :)",6.0,paolapessot,2024-07-08,3.0,2.0
280180,No summary,"Can someone please tell me why this movie isn't playing in theatres?!?! This could have been so much fun to watch with an audience on the big screen. I don't understand how Paramount let Netflix get ahold of the rights, but with a proper advertising campaign, this could have done really well in theatres. Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is how you do a legacy sequel right! It's enjoyable and has some good action, great comedic moments, a great nostalgic soundtrack, the OG cast, and a fun, albeit lacklustre plot. It's just like the original films, just brought into the modern age. It feels like a Beverly Hills Cop film should, and Eddie Murphy truly is BACK in his iconic role of Axel Foley. While this sequel struggles to tell a compelling overall story, there is plenty present that will pull fans into this world once more, including a nice emotional touch with Taylour Paige's Jane. The action is solid, the score is full of retro goodness, and there are plenty of charming and funny Murphy moments that I have been missing as of late.

Next week, bam! I find out that a new Beverly Hills Cop movie came out. Is it good? It's not bad. And it hits the right spot for 80's nostalgia, while also looking like another cash grab using the last ounce of recognizability of washed out actors.The original cast is made out of people over 60, with John Ashton being 76. Add in two young-er people and Kevin Bacon (to cut out the middlemen) and hit all the chords of the original and you've got yourself a movie. Someone probably fleshed out the script in 30 minutes while sitting on the toilet. Soundtrack? Check. Original cast? Check. Same jokes, slightly updated? Check. Beverly Hills rich weirdos and mansions? Check. Police car chasing big trucks that smash everything but hit no one? Double check.While it is not a bad movie, it is pretty much a by the numbers script, lacking any sort of original thought or attempt at innovation or evolution. The characters are doing the same things and saying and acting the same as 40 years ago, which is enjoyable for us old farts, but a pretty sad state of affairs for the characters and their actors.

280180,No summary,"This fourth instalments will please lovers of the franchise, fans of Eddie Murphy and lovers of entertaining movies in this order. I am in the last category and I am not disappointed. The humour , the situations and the one liners are no match to "" Rush hour"" and "" Hangover"" franchise but all the same keep one hooked with the fast flowing narrative, the car chases, the crashes and the general excitement as Eddie drives or is driven or even flown in a police helicopter. ( Can a police helicopter be called copter btw ? ). Eddie plays a middle aged Detroit police detective with a grown up and estranged daughter Jane who is a defense attorney. Their paths cross while investigating a crime but there is no thaw in the relationship for quite some time. Later they team up and are joined by her ex boyfriend Bobby and two colleagues of Eddie in their efforts to solve a crime.Director Mark Molloy has packed in lots of action which is quite entertaining no doubt. A few scenes are edge of the seat type. A scene of low flying out of control helicopter in the streets is exciting stuff. This is rightfully Eddie's show and he takes us on a rollercoaster ride.

280180,No summary,"The return of Eddie Murphy as Axel Foley in ""Beverly Hills Cop, Axel F."" was meant to be a highlight of Hollywood's nostalgia wave this year. However, the film only partially succeeds in capturing the magic of the original series.The humor, once a hallmark of the franchise, now feels dated. The jokes that were fresh and edgy in the '80s and '90s fall flat today. The screenplay relies too heavily on old gags and lacks new, innovative ideas, resulting in a story that feels banal and predictable.The plot is transparent, with few surprises. It's clear from the outset where the story is headed, and it unfolds without any significant twists. This might satisfy die-hard fans looking for familiar elements, but for a broader audience, it comes off as dull and uninspired.Eddie Murphy still shines as Axel Foley, delivering a performance full of energy. Joseph Gordon-Levitt also fits surprisingly well into the cast, bringing a fresh dynamic. The enthusiasm of the actors is evident and is one of the film's few bright spots.Despite solid performances, the film falters due to its reliance on nostalgia. Hollywood's trend of exploiting franchises is glaringly obvious here. The attempt to lure fans with familiar faces and old jokes, without offering anything genuinely new, feels forced and underscores a lack of creativity in the industry.Overall, ""Beverly Hills Cop, Axel F."" feels out of place and out of time. The nostalgia wave has hit hard, showing that past successes can't simply be recycled. A bit more innovation and less reliance on the past could have made a significant difference.

This latest installment successfully blends elements of classic 80s action-comedy with modern twists, appealing both to long-time fans and new viewers.Plot and CharactersThe film continues the adventures of Axel Foley, played by Eddie Murphy, who reprises his iconic role with the same charisma and humor that made him a star. This time, Foley returns to Beverly Hills to solve a personal case involving a close friend, but soon finds himself entangled in a complex web of corruption and danger. The plot is engaging, with plenty of twists and turns to keep the audience invested. However, it occasionally feels predictable, relying on familiar tropes from previous films in the series.The supporting cast delivers solid performances. Newcomers bring fresh energy to the film, while returning characters add a sense of continuity and depth. The chemistry between the characters, especially Foley and his Beverly Hills counterparts, is one of the film's highlights. Their banter and camaraderie provide many of the film's funniest and most heartfelt moments.Humor and Action""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F"" strikes a good balance between humor and action. The comedy is sharp and witty, with Murphy's comedic timing as impeccable as ever. There are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, but the film also knows when to dial back the humor to let the action and drama take center stage.The action sequences are well-executed and visually impressive, blending practical effects with modern CGI. Car chases, shootouts, and hand-to-hand combat scenes are all choreographed with precision and flair, making for thrilling and dynamic viewing. However, some action scenes feel a bit over-the-top, which might not appeal to all viewers.Nostalgia and ModernizationOne of the film's strengths is its ability to honor the legacy of the original ""Beverly Hills Cop"" movies while updating the formula for a contemporary audience. The soundtrack, featuring a modern remix of the iconic ""Axel F"" theme, effectively bridges the gap between old and new. The film also includes several nods to the original trilogy, which will delight longtime fans.However, the film occasionally relies too heavily on nostalgia, which can feel forced at times. While it's great to see familiar faces and hear familiar tunes, the movie sometimes struggles to carve out its own identity, leaning too much on the success of its predecessors.Conclusion""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F"" is a fun, action-packed, and humorous return to form for the franchise. Eddie Murphy shines in his role, and the film offers a good mix of nostalgia and modern elements. Despite some predictable plot points and occasional over-reliance on past glories, it delivers an entertaining and enjoyable experience. Fans of the original movies will appreciate the nods to the past, while new viewers will find plenty to enjoy in this lively and spirited action-comedy.",7.0,arsalanweb,2024-07-08,1.0,1.0

280180,No summary,"... and Eddie is back as well 😊 I know, he never left, but when I started watching this movie, I immediately realized, which of Eddie's roles I love: he's always funny - but for me he has to be funny AND cool in his roles. Like in 48hours, Trading Places, Golden Child etc. And in this movie he nails it again. He's really great. And there's so much nostalgia... I don't wanna spoil too much. There's one other thing I like about this movie: in the 80ies and 90ies the lead characters often were tough guys. And so many took them as role models back then. But this movie shows the price of not being mature enough to embrace all those feelings that back then were called ""weak"" but are just normal and natural emotions. This is a way better role model.",9.0,andreasley-72791,2024-07-08,3.0,2.0
280180,No summary,"As a big fan of the originals and eddie murphy (grew up with his comedy), I was praying that this movie wouldn't be a let down as many sequels, especially sequels from big franchises, can just not live up to the hype. As soon as the movie title rolled out, and the first thing we see is axel in the same car from the original Beverly Hills Cop while Glen Freys 'The Heat Is On' blasts out, I couldn't help but smile with that nostalgia feeling. This movie is a gem for any fan of the originals. The movie soundtrack is just track after track of nostalgia. Eddie's wit hasnt changed and laughing at the countless times he tries to talk his way in or out of situations. Seeing the BHC characters Billy, Taggert and Serge was brilliant. Honestly this movie is great. My only negative is I wish it was in the cinema and not just on Netflix. Would have enjoyed this on the big screen.

280180,No summary,"I would put this as on par with BHC2. It actually uses the same formula from the original which is great. They even used a fair amount of music from the original - also great.I thought the banter at times was quite funny and the call backs to events of the originals was really enjoyable.If you are really young and haven't seen especially the first movie then I would give this a 6 instead of an 8 for you. For me the memba berries were quite welcome and exactly what I wanted to see. You can call that fan service I guess but hey sometimes as fans we watch expecting to consume lots of memba berries. Top Gun served up the same berries which I loved.Eddie Murphy was amazingly spry for a 63 year old and much funnier than his last probably 10 movies. He had a lot of that old magic.To the reviews here that say this was boring I guess I saw a different movie as I guess they expect city to be swallowed up in a giant earthquake or something but that aspect was good.Bottom line if you loved the first movie you will love this, if not then it's hit or miss for you.",8.0,bioidentix,2024-07-08,4.0,3.0

280180,No summary,"It is an American action comedy film directed by Mark Molloy and written by Will Beall, Tom Gormican and Kevin Etten. The story of the film revolves around Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy). Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) returns to Beverly Hills once again, but this time the reason is personal. His daughter Jane (Taylor Page), whom he has not met for a long time, has gotten involved with the wrong people and now needs to be saved. Axel has to save his daughter as well as deal with the villains who are plotting a big conspiracy in Beverly Hills. The film shows the emotional aspect of the father-daughter relationship.Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is the sequel and you will find Eddie Murphy once again in his old role as Axel Foley. Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Paul Reiser and Bronson Pinchot have also reprised their roles from the previous films. Eddie Murphy has once again brought the character of Axel Foley to life. His comic timing and charismatic personality have made the film enjoyable. Jane's character (Taylor Paige) has also performed well, although her chemistry with Eddie Murphy seems a bit unnatural. Other characters in the film have also done a good job in their parts, but the main attraction is Murphy's performance.The film attempts to show the relationship between Axel and Jane, which gives the story an emotional depth. Though the story seems a bit generic and predictable at places, Eddie Murphy's brilliant acting handles it to a large extent. This father-daughter duo, though clichéd, but the dialogues and emotional scenes between them add a deeper layer to the story.There is no dearth of action scenes in the film. The action scenes of the film are imaginative, some scenes lack direction and performance, which makes them not as effective. Some scenes are very exciting, but some scenes are not that effective. The action scenes needed a little more effort so that it could completely engage the audience.Music is a strong side of the film. There is a good mix of music in the film. A mix of old hit songs as well as new songs keeps the audience engaged. In particular, old songs like Harold Faltermeyer's classic tune 'Axel F', Pointer Sisters' 'Neutron Dance', Bob Seger's 'Shakedown', and Glenn Frey's 'The Heat Is On' add to the charm of the film. Also, Lil Nas X's new song 'Here We Go' is also successful in attracting young audiences.Overall ""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F"" is a mixed experience. It is neither completely bad nor very good. This movie will not completely disappoint you, but it will not leave any deep impression in your heart either. Despite Eddie Murphy's brilliant performance and a great choice of music, the story and action scenes of the movie fall a bit short. This movie is entertaining, but not great. It is worth watching once, especially if you are a fan of Eddie Murphy and a fan of the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" series.This review of the movie attempts to give you the full picture, so that you can better understand your viewing decision.(Read the review and decide how good or bad it is.

280180,No summary,"Although you can almost never beat the originals, but this one surprisingly was an extremely pleasant watch. To me it was the best of the franchise. Great job Eddie! You still got it👏. It wasn't a deep plot but it certainly was pretty funny. Axel's constant jabber always get him out of trouble or should I say Eddie's 😂. Relationship dynamics wasn't all that considering that the logic behind why they were estranged wasn't deep ergo not well thought off by the writers. Kevin Bacon played a good villain although I feel like they should've made it more sinister. One more thing the writers messed up on: it was clear to everyone from the beginning that Bacon was dirty but somehow the chief didn't catch that. That was lazy writing. To sum it up: Awesome acting, writing needs work.",9.0,aidansrenard,2024-07-08,4.0,3.0
280180,No summary,"Unless an impressive mix of AI and CGI had been liberally applied to this longish 2024 sequel, there was little chance that the energy level of the original ""Beverly Hills Cop"" could be faithfully recaptured. At the same time, this intentionally nostalgic, fully formulaic action comedy directed by Mike Molloy was more middling than mediocre thanks mostly to Eddie Murphy's dependable comic sensibilities as Axel Foley, a role so interchangeable with his screen persona that it looks like he really didn't put in that much effort. It's been forty years since Murphy's first outing, and Axel has yet another reason to leave his hometown of Detroit for Beverly Hills. This time it's the danger that his estranged daughter, an embattled and embittered public defender, faces in exposing a conspiracy that turns out to be driven within the Beverly Hills police department. Old characters come back with their familiar personalities intact while looking understandably older. New characters embrace the plot conventions with deadpan aplomb. There was one funny real estate scene in a mansion, and the inevitable climax was more engaging than I expected. The supporting cast was mostly game, but this one was definitely for Murphy's more devoted fans.",6.0,EUyeshima,2024-07-08,3.0,3.0

This movie is a lot more laid back then the previously high energy, fast paced, relying heavily on everyone expectations that it will be as good as the previous 3. But is more subdued focusing on Axels failures as a father and he trying to rekindle his relationship with his estranged daughter who is a Beverly Hill Lawyer.I found the characters very much aged and much more subdued in this sequel compared to their high action escapades in the previous series. It was a good movie but did not fulfill my expectations for the 4th. Sequel. Just don't expect it to match the excitement from the 3 previous movies.

280180,No summary,"Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F (2024) unabashedly and unapologetically serves up a heaping helping of nostalgia for fans of the 1984 original and its two sequels. Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) hasn't changed much. He's still the wisecracking, irreverent, street cop with uncanny skills of observation and deduction, who is driven to follow through regardless of the risks or cost. Physically, Murphy hasn't changed much in the forty years since he first played Foley at twenty-four, beyond gaining a few pounds. However, his hair looks oddly unreal, to the point of distracting. By contrast, several of the actors reprising their roles seem quite a bit older. Perhaps it's a tribute to Murphy's healthy living and sobriety.The car chases are much more elaborate and on par with some of the best contemporary action sequences. However, the plot is more in line with a 1970 television program - or the earlier Beverly Hills Cop movies.The posters for the original feature Axel sitting on the hood of a red Mercedes Benz, holding an automatic pistol. The current film uses a similar image, but the pistol is held much more discretely. This time, Axel largely avoids firearms, even when one would expect a trained, experienced officer to have drawn. He flashes a weapon when he hijacks a vehicle for a car chase, but doesn't actually fire one until the final big shootout.Perhaps the most challenging role is that of Jane Saunders, horribly miscast with Taylour Paige, who must play Axel's estranged daughter who grows to respect him, his reluctant sidekick, a high-powered criminal-defense attorney, and the former love interest of Detective Bobby Abbott (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), but is wooden and unconvincing in each role. She displays considerable anger toward Axel, but it isn't layered. She just sounds like an angry black woman railing against the establishment. There is zero chemistry between her and Abbott.The screenplay tries to serve too many masters. As an action-comedy, it must straddle two genres, and incorporate nostalgic elements and cameos from the earlier films, bridge a forty-year gap, develop a backstory for a central character the audience hasn't seen before; develop a family drama that was never part of the franchise; maintain bromances between Axel and three characters he hasn't seen for years; and find time for social relevance, while yielding screen time to lengthy chase sequences and a gunfight. The result is a mishmash that is entertaining, but ultimately forgettable.",4.0,ginocox-206-336968,2024-07-08,4.0,5.0

280180,No summary,"This was a surreal experience watching a sequel to a 40 year old movie (less is you count the previous sequels). I was amazed at how m any of the original cast they were able to round up. After forty years I would have suspected many would have retired or passed away.Eddie Murphy looks like he aged the least even though he's in his 60s now. The film itself is almost a tribute to the previous installments being very similar. You don't see films quite like this unless it is in the b-movie genre. Racing down a city street with abandon, destroying cars and property, no regard to by-standers. With guns fights galore and only the bad guys can miss. And no emotional repercussions for the good guys killing bad guys with abandon. If you want to relive an 1980's action film, this encapsulates it well.Having seen the original in the movie theater this was like a time machine. I think the only thing that was really off putting was Eddie Murphy's character continual insinuation that his daughter had a sexual relationship with another character. This might have been funny back in the 80s but just doesn't work in this day and age.Otherwise, welcome to the time machine.",7.0,MissyTheCat,2024-07-07,63.0,6.0

I know he's older, but continues to be cast in roles that expect that 80's flare he once had.To the honest, Kevin Bacon was the only ""big"" actor who actually did a decent job in this movie.

280180,No summary,"As tribute to Beverly Hills Cop it is quite good
As a cop movie it is okay
As a Beverly Hills Cop movie it is a bit lacking.Seeing the old characters from the original movies is fun and it brings back great memories, however their parts are very small. I was left wanting much more of each; and none are really integral parts of the movie.Murphy is 63 years old so I didn't expect him to be dangling off a delivery truck this time around. But I did so miss his humor. The problem there is, much of his humor in the early movies isn't PC enough for today. And over the years his acting style has moved on from largely surrounding his infectious laugh and goofy characters to a much more serious style.His charm shows through from time to time but the writing often felt lazy and a bit too careful.The uniqueness of the first movies was the reverse fish out of water scenario. His character was so comfortable and so confident that even though he was in someone else's world, they were the ones that felt out of place. This one lacked that element. Instead of teaming him up with straight laced cops afraid of losing their jobs, they matched him with his estranged daughter. Who was neither likable, nor charming. Mostly she was just tense and angry, which works for other movies, but not a Beverly Hills Cop.She did get one Caucasian joke in, but unlike Eddie's likeable, goofy, delivery that always made his jokes about anyone funny, her delivery came across with more disdain than finding humor in it. She just didn't seem to know when to pare back the intensity and enjoy being in a Beverly Hills Cop movie.At its worst it is okay and at its best it is an enjoyable reminder to watch the first two movies again.",6.0,ta-60644,2024-07-07,3.0,3.0

Nope, I had the feeling it wasn't going to work. Like the other dozen Hollywood spin offs that haven't.Murpy's daughter sets the tone though. The movie makes well, right up until she injects a full dialogue with Murphy. She comes off this bad ass, I'm self made lawyer, smelling of accolades, ready to rumble mentality, driving her LA Bling, Bling sporty car.After watching the picture half way.

The actors all looked old and tired. Rosewood looks my my grandpa, and Taggart is worse. The jokes are lame and nonexistent. The gags are old and tired. I swear they dug up every actor who wasn't dead from the original movie and gave them a part. It's contrived, not believable and as exciting as oatmeal for breakfast at the old folks home. The musical score was great 40 years ago, but now it's just plain old, too.I can't believe that Eddie Murphy actually agreed to do this. There is not one likable character in the movie.The actress who plays Murphy's daughter is not likable, she's not attractive, and she can't act. Were they not able to get a real actress to agree to be part of this tripe? There is no chemistry between her and Murphy and the relationship is not believable. I cannot believe that anyone ever cast her for this part. Yes, she's that bad.Rosewood looks. Old. Really old. Taggert looks ancient. Neither is believable as a working cop. They look older than Biden, by a long shot. And it's not just that they're old, they look TERRIBLE.They could have dug up all the Golden Girls and hired them and had younger looking actors. And, they would probably do a better job of acting.They tried to redo the first movie with the same crashes, the same gags and the same actors, and 40 years downstream it does NOT work. It's essentially the same script as the first movie, except they changed the opening scene from a semi loaded with cigarettes to a snow plow. Same shootout at a mansion. Same tired line from Rosewood after the shootout's over. This is not a comedy. I know, because I never laughed. I never yucked. I never even smiled. I tried, but all I could do was groan.I love Eddie Murphy. Beverly Hills Cop, 48 hours, Life, Mr. Church; he's an amazing actor. But the magic is gone, gone, gone.

A desperate ""one last time"" with all the characters that made the first movie great, with the added annoyance of Axels uptight daughter. The movie never really explores any of the relationships (father, daughter and daughter - goofy cop). It's just flat, and as a viewer you don't really care about any of the characters.

280180,No summary,"I didn't need to check IMDb, or any movie critic's column, to know this movie would have - at best! - lackluster reviews.Be smart: ignore them all.The truth is that this is a surprisingly zesty, dramatically competent and generally fun-packed return to the venerable Beverly Hills Cop franchise. This kind of let's-get-the-band-back-together thing rarely works, but Axel F is that rare outlier that recaptures the magic of the original series.Yes, Axel Foley is older and quite a bit heavier. But Eddie Murphy is absolutely on form in the role. Aided by a script that revives the old banter perfectly.Foley's original LA police counterparts - Rosewood and Taggart - are looking a bit seedy, but they're used sparingly and wisely. It's particularly great to see the resurrection of Bronson Pinchot as the preposterously affected Serge. It's great that none of the characters is de-aged - instead, the movie plays up their decrepitude.So, while Axel F does provide a nice does of nostalgia, it doesn't rely on it. Instead, the central drama pits Axel against a new character - his estranged 30-something daughter, now a prestigious criminal lawyer in LA. Taylour Paige.imbues the part with great sincerity, bringing just the right amount of serious emotion to anchor the story.On top of those virtues, Axel F offers some really good - and remarkably innovative - action sequences. The highlight is a chase involving reality-defying hijinks in a helicopter. But Axel F doesn't simply bombard the viewer with mindless car-crashes. Like the original Beverly Hills Cop, it hits a near-perfect balance between Axel Foley's brand of street-wise investigations, over-the-top action and human drama.So don't be put off by the usual gang-up of nay-sayers. Yes, this return to Beverly Hills really *should* have been embarrassing, mawkish and tedious. But it's not. It's an astonishingly successful revival of a much-loved franchise - not to mention a great return to form from the perpetually underestimated Eddie Murphy.",8.0,fung0,2024-07-07,5.0,2.0

And of course they had to throw in the domestic disputes of father and daughter, to spark that drama every one seems to crave these days, instead of just having FUN! Movies think they are reality now and that is why they suck. Movies were made to ESCAPE reality. And there are certain genres to watch if you want that but it does not belong in this franchise. Foley does not need an estranged daughter weighing him down. Who in the world do you think wants an annoying character entering your space and taking all of your attention away from your friend? It is a dumb move. But films continue to do this crap, like Indiana Jones.Also, they do not even attempt to explain who Kevin Bacon is as the bad guy. He, like all other known faces, are just planted in the story for familiarity instead of story. And this is why this movie fails. It made me actually miss part 3, which has grown on me over the last 2 decades. Bacon is the best part about this movie and they give him NOTHING to work with. He is so underused so they can make room for father/daughter, boyfriend/girlfriend crap. This isn't a teeny pop movie. It's an ACTION comedy. Filmmakers really gotta start stepping up their game!Also, the director of his had zero clue what they were going for. It seems he has never even seen parts 1-3, from the vibe and atmosphere of this one. I'm just tired of filmmakers and actors phoning in their duties now. It has become just another job instead of a passion and that's sad.Movie needed more serious bonding between the old characters that moved the story, instead of just having them appear for fan-service and be useless. Serge especially had a small and forgettable part when they could have used him as part of the team this time. But instead of progress the characters we want they toss new boring ones down our throats. Hollywood is so far removed from what we want that it is becoming laughable.It is still a fine movie to sit through.

There was some running series gags remaking scenes from previous movies in the series but the humor just wasn't there. It was like a bunch of old guys wanted to relive the glory days of the original movie. Don't get me wrong movie was ok but it was on the low side of average for what expected.

Cops aren't looked at the same way they were in 1984. It's anything but fun and games to be a cop today, but they don't address this, at all, and the characters don't seem to realize this!It was nice to see Jerry Bruckheimer back on board as producer. He produced the first one and the immensely popular ""Top Gun: Maverick"". So quite naturally, this one is titled ""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F"". But unlike that movie, which was meticulously produced by Bruckheimer and Tom Cruise, with the utmost respect for the audience, after a dynamite opening credit sequence, this one rehashes a few lines and stupid scenes from the first one that just seem so out of place in 2024.But the worst part about this movie, is Eddie Murphy isn't even funny. I can't believe I'm saying this. In the 80s, I thought Murphy was the funniest comedian, ever! What makes Murphy funny, is his uncanny ability to do spot on impressions. Here, there's none of that! He has one scene with a parking attendant where they're talking ""hood"" talk, and then the parking attendant turns on a dime and starts doing a British accent. That got the biggest laugh out of me. But Murphy should have had that line!On the bright side, the young woman who plays Axel's daughter, Taylor Paige, is very good! It would have been a better movie if they lost the Beverly Hills cop angle, and wrote a totally different movie with Murphy and her, with the same father daughter conflict. Now that would've been a good movie!As is, this movie really insults the intelligence of the audience, with the third act being an incredible letdown, and so predictable. There's a scene where Murphy and his partner, played by Joseph Gordon Levitt, commandeer a helicopter. Murphy doesn't know how to fly it, and Gordon Levitt has an idea how to fly it, but he's rusty. Who would go up in a helicopter with him?? But this scene is supposedly played for laughs. ""Hey, we're flying around in this helicopter, and we don't know wtf doing, isn't this funny?""

280180,No summary,"Did someone say Foley? After a long absence Detroit's sassiest street cop is back on the screen to do what he does best: get into trouble, only this time he's brought all of his old pals back along with him. Watchable if lukewarm sequel is funny in spurts, primarily due to Murphy who's Axel Foley still has some juice even though we haven't seen him out on the west coast in thirty years. Seeing the gang back together again brings plenty of nostalgia, and a selective soundtrack to recall the series' origins certainly doesn't hurt, plus the chaotic (and creative) action scenes help propel the movie through its intermittent lulls, but the plot about Axel and his attempt to reconnect with his estranged daughter while also unraveling a money laundering conspiracy is weak. **½",,Special-K88,2024-07-06,3.0,2.0

The first time seeing the GTA5 Hollywood with the similar action, like I was watching a 4k GTA5 Axel F MOD.They had to find a way to have a action cop/crime that in my mind they spent near minimum on actors and just rolled out people who were way way older...
To setup and have Axel F and music crush 5-7 million on just GTA5 FUBAR and was fun to watch even though it was not a plot.. it made up in the action. It was just right the right feel to set them all legit even as old as they were against the cartel.I had one thing that I thought would have been a perfect way to stick the landing on this and enjoy my ending.Banana in the TailpipeIt would have been a way to span 40 years and instant viral mention in all reviews.I am thinking this would have made kids wonder what the Banana in the Tailpipe means and have made it stand out since the options are so wide this movie having this hashtag
""#BananaintheTailpipe""My ending...It would have been a nice touchstone to get the traffic and get in the screens of kids to watch all the old stuff so I as soon as I was done already had a ending and wished Eddie had called...Ohh thats write... I am a nobody... but savage mind.I get him a 5th the chance and move the franchise into a introduce his daughter to take on the same vibe so the can legit have great fight actions of her going Axel F and place him in the next being aware he created a monster even he in 5 plays the comic as he is witness to her out Axel Fing mind and he can be very funny she takes the on a legit roll of a even more savage him training and realized at the end here with that the base concept for 5 with this ending a setup... enjoy.End 3 punch scene will create a end payoff and create a very way unexpected end...Scene... setting 1 to create a realistic and everyone definitely I can help him create a trailer that
1. Axel finding out as he is arguing with the cops saying Foley ordered you be taken here... and Axel saying I am Foley and being in the last scene not the same old song and dance tear jerker... I would have landed 2 more movies by this ending...2. Him being taken into an office and her her revealed that creates a really Axel F savage ending.Event that say
Telling her dad he was right Beverly Hills needs a Foley here and him boasting yes with him being yes they need me thinking he is about to be chief and being Axel...This is a really great ending that is perfect Axel F ...
Her say Officer next time you come here you will check in and hand him a card and be way more powerful and savage end...
Her writing on a card and
Payoff/Mindblown/Pavlov cannot wait to see 5 that gets greenlite...
I am a savage!1. Axel stunned as he notices and camera reveals.. as Axel everyone at that moment realizes...
2. It is Captain Cade Grants card...
3. She just x'd out Cade Grant
4. And now above Cade GrantCaptain with her spelling it as he sees that she definitely5. Captain F-O-L-E-YTells him please close the door on the way out...
Him muttering and I took a bullet for you.. disrespect ful...
As he close the door.. he in the face stunned as Judge...Asks whats wrong..Axel hands him the card and says...OMG!Axel F, I honestly was just made aware maybe we made a mistake..Judge... We... as the old Chief passes the card and laughing as they are chasing him you need to help .. this is a bad thing. Axel.. trying ti assure himself no I can keep her level... and as the elevator looks at the card and says this alone makes up for everything you all put me through... and yeah Axel... I just realized you 2 better be ready...So do not call me... Until Captain Foley is in Detroit...closing with them just trying to convince each other she has way better control... we can keep her from and both just like .. finally muttering... I think nothing is ready for Captain Foley... and Axel... it really is jarring... and judge and him walking stunned aimless in that at times Axel and him she is just kidding... instant back to them 2 realizing they really are the ones about to face a chaos they have no way to know what is going to trigger that Foley..END WITHJust that card fully on the entire screenAnd Axel F the card stays up and the credits roll all with that card...Creates a very cool end... just taking that card stays in a sill that if the movie ends stays as a stunt to imprint that 5 is a certainty...A reveal she telling a very unspoken and very much better...
Her doing that makes a really interesting cliff hanger to ramp into the revival And Judge becomes Chief and creates a way better ending that makes sense, This would be a no brain and easy to fund and get back into the box office and generate a real buzz that instantly pumps real life into and not depending on a needing to write a daddy daughter end that has no punch...A Axel F and the things to place Axel into and trying to keep up with and she just keeps this more and more able to escape but Axel F trying to make her remember she is human.. and would be pretty funny placing the characters deal with out of is easy to write a really great story keeps Axel and because she is a believable physically able to ass action scene that are not placing her in a typical role and matches the franchise.A missed chance to really stick a landing that would have been viral historic and given the bump to get the younger demo as it would be something talked about...
That they missed such would have certainly been talked about in the reviews and branded 1984 to 2024.A woman version of him would IMO made this 2 more movies very fast...
Maybe Eddie Murphy should call me to create a story... I am very good and if asked to develop for Murphy.. please and thanks and have other very good ideas.Eddie I will work for you free.",10.0,MASSDEBATED,2024-07-06,6.0,3.0
280180,No summary,Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F was such a delight to watch! Eddie Murphy is back and brought his A+ game with his comedy and the action. You can tell the team behind this movie really respected the original and wanted to pay tribute to it without overstepping and becoming something different. This entry was far better than the 2nd and 3rd film but the original is still the best. It was awesome getting to see the original gang back together even though we only get about a solid 10-15 minutes of them all on screen at the same time. The action and comedy is very quick paced throughout. Loved the storyline involving Axel and his daughter which plays a big part in this one. My only issue is the story could have been a little tighter and included more scenes/depth to Joseph Gordon Levitt's character. I also really didn't care to much for Kevin Bacon's character as he was one dimensional. The movie has one of the better endings of the entire series and would be a perfect way to end the franchise once and for all. I really think that Netflix could have increased the budget here just a little and made this a theatrical release instead of straight to streaming. Overall I really enjoyed this and enjoyed all of the call backs. Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F gets a solid 8 stars out of 10.,8.0,djrmc24,2024-07-06,6.0,1.0

280180,No summary,"Beverly Hills Cop is a great action comedy from the 1980s, but its sequels didn't exactly work for me. I was excited to hear about them making a sequel so many years later, bringing back the whole cast from the first film, but I also worried that it would be in line with the quality of the previous sequels. While I certainly have my issues with Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F, it's easily the best sequel. From some excellent action to some great one-liners, this is a sequel that captures the essence of the first film but never reaches the same heights. Now streaming on Netflix, here are my thoughts.Taking place many years after the third instalment, the film picks up with Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) as he is still the same (aged) cop that he was before, still patrolling in Detroit. After receiving a call that his daughter is involved in a shady court case, he travels back to Beverly Hills. The plot then thickens and crooked cops, a couple twists, and familiar faces all begin to elevate the film. I will say though that it does suffer from pacing issues. The last 20 minutes are what fans of these films are waiting for and I believe it delivers on that promise, it's just that it took a little too long to get there.For being a very simplistic story, the father-daughter relationship (even though it's good) plays out too slowly and becomes focused on far too much. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Detective Bobby Abbott was a nice addition to the film and I enjoyed the chemistry and banter between him and Foley, but I do wish that Judge Reinhold's Billy Rosewood had more screen time with him. As I said, this film is just a build-up to some great fan service moments that all work, but it didn't quite last long enough for me. I believe some quicker editing and a few beats removed here and there would've made for a snappier watch. Still, it's almost like they make you wait for the goods you want, which is fine since it all worked for me.All in all, I went into this late sequel hoping for some fun action, Eddie Murphy to be having a good time again in the role, and a nice mixture of comedy and drama, which was what the original film balanced well, and I got just that. It's done in a streamlined and safe way, but it was still entertaining nonetheless. I feel as though audiences will have a good time with this one, especially if they liked previous instalments. I do wish this one played in theatres, given its large budget and solid action sequences, but Netflix just continues to do what they do. Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F was unnecessary, but welcome at the same time. I'd say check it out.",7.0,kjproulx,2024-07-06,3.0,2.0

The same jokes, same situations, same 'ol tropes, same... same. Where it was fresh, witty and original forty years ago it now just feels old and tired. The actors - freshly extracted from their respective retirements homes - speak slowly, move slowly, act slowly. Eddie Murphy still moves, talks and quips with the same spark as before, but this is a not a one-person stand-up comedy show and both the script and his fellow actors drag him down. The various re-enactments - and the movie seems mainly made up of those - of skits and highlights from the original just feels predictable, slow and uninteresting. We all know how they're going to end, one and all.In the end... yes... a very sympathetic cast reunion and that saves it from a less flattering score, but that's simply not enough to make it a good movie.

The exploration of the dad-daughter-daughter's ex dynamic is very 2020s Netflix-esque, and the action is largely uninteresting (except for an intentionally shoddy helicopter chase), but there are also these humor-laden in-betweens that work (well, some of it at least). Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a fine addition to the mix, and the way the film handles its legacy characters is fairly alright.

If you've seen the first two BHC movies, you will definitely pick up on all the visual nods, dialogue, and plot references to the original movies.For the uninitiated, if you want to understand and appreciate this movie's charm, first watch the original BHC I and II (III is ""meh"" but watchable).

The only thing worse than the miserable character she plays is her wooden and emotionless portrayal of it.The returning cast is enjoyable; even if Reinhold and Ashton are almost comically old they still have some of the old spark. Paul Reiser is enjoyable as, well, pretty much Det. Paul Riser. For my money the standout returnee is Bronson Pinchot. He's still a riot as Serge 30 years later with no discernible improvement in his English skills.While the plot is predictable, the action and old-school (non-CGI) effects are great. It all adds up to an enjoyable trip back to Beverly Hills.",7.0,wjones-57006,2024-07-06,3.0,2.0

The script and acting were both superb, so much action so many laughs. Eddie was giving his all as were the rest of the gang, Paul reiser was a little wasted, but that's the only gripe I would have. As for the rest of the cast, they're back and feel like they have ever left. As much as I would love to see a fifth one, I kind of hope they don't, they did everything they had to do with this one.

280180,No summary,"Thirty years after the dreadful third film, Eddie Murphy returns to the role of Axel Foley. And, having been pumped up for this film leading up to its release, suffice it to say I was mostly satisfied with it. Granted, it uses two cliches that I detest: the main character having an adult kid that he's estranged from and the awkward romance between two former lovers. However, the latter doesn't get much focus and as for the former, well we'll get to that. For me, the most important thing was seeing Axel doing his usual shtick and getting up to his usual antics. And, in that regard, the film delivers in spades. There are a ton of great comic and action set pieces, often mixed together. And Axel is still a great character, able to smooth talk his way out of anything in hilarious fashion. With that said, the film does mix up the formula now and then, like having Axel start his usual shtick only to drop the act because he isn't in the mood. The film actually has a mystery, not revealing the villain right away (though they are obvious from the get go). Beverly Hills looks great as always. And the soundtrack is stellar, including some returning tracks from the previous films and a cool rendition of the Axel F theme from Lil Nas X.Eddie Murphy's return as Axel is more than welcome, still giving the character the boundless energy and motor mouth that we've come to expect from him. Billy is great too, it's awesome to see Taggart again, and they bring back Serge's bit with Axel in spectacular fashion. However, the new characters are more of a mixed bag. Kevin Bacon and Luis Guzman are great as always. Joseph Gordon Levitt is boring at first, but he has good chemistry with everyone and has some funny moments later on. And then, there's Taylour Paige as Axel's daughter. On the one hand, her constant whining towards him (which takes up a good chunk of their dialogue together) is really annoying. On the other, I understand where she's coming from and she does have some funny moments, especially when she one-ups him at his own game.Overall, Beverly Hills Cop Axel F is a more than welcome return for this classic series. It's nowhere near as good as the first two, but it's miles above the third. It's just good nostalgic fun that I'm sure fans of the series will get a kick out of.",8.0,gnperuti,2024-07-06,5.0,1.0
280180,No summary,"I am glad to say I had high hopes for this sequel and I was not disappointed. Eddie Murphy has been killing it in the last couple of films.( especially the film about Dolemite! ) So, I was really happy with Beverly Hills Cop 4. The last installment (Beverly Hills Cop 3) was not well received, but upon recent viewing is not THAT bad, a huge drop in quality from the first and second films. Pt 4 is more of a modern take on the franchise with lots of action, but still funny. Eddie definitely still has got it and much of the original cast returns. The pace is quick, Eddie is funny and clever as ever and if you are looking for action, Beverly Hills Cop has tons. The film looks great and the gunplay, characters and story are all on point. This is modern and does not feel like a tired retread of the 80's. Overall, this was masterfully done and I really enjoyed Beverly Hills Cop 4.",8.0,dworldeater,2024-07-06,7.0,2.0

Although I guess a portion of that was Eddie Murphy's salary.The set-up is your basic ""return to basics"" kind of plot. Everyone's favorite cop from Detroit Axel Foley winds up back in Beverly Hills for a case. This time he is teamed up with a former pilot (JGL) and his estranged daughter (Paige) against a group of dirty cops led by Kevin Bacon. I forgot his character's name, but let's be real. It's every Kevin Bacon villain ever so the name does not matter.Some of the action is not badly staged. I liked the opening chase scene in downtown Detroit. It's the part in the trailers with the snowplow.

No, but neither were the classics and the writing is definitely good enough for it to fit in with the classics and they managed to integrate the old characters as well who I thought did a great job.This film easily deserves it place in the franchise which is rare to say about modern versions of classic franchises.It's honestly a big shame this didn't get to debut on the silver screen and instead getting released straight into peoples living rooms and smartphones.

It mostly captures the frenetic energy of the first Beverly Hills Cop, which came out 40 years ago! Wow.Incredibly, practically all of the actors return including Bronson Pinchot who once again does his Israeli accent shtick in a fluffy scene about halfway through. It starts off with a spectacular arrest in Detroit the way the original did with Axel getting into hot water with his superiors (Paul Reiser) about destroying city property.The music score recaptured the upbeat music clips from the original using the same synthesizer loops and perky melodies. It's mostly a cohesive story and ends satisfyingly, again similarly to the first film.The negatives? It's not really a negative, but the producers left out practically all of the funny bits from the first two movies probably aware that with all of the character's advanced ages that it might not work. On the other hand, they avoided characters directly saying ""I'm getting too old for this crap.""The actress portraying Axel's daughter came across so wooden and devoid of emotion and spirit that it clashed with the film's tone during every scene she was in, every scene. Other reviewers have also wondered out loud how she even got cast in the first place, with one of them mentioning something about a couch.Overall, it's better than you think it would be and it contains plenty of crazy action scenes. It's also a huge improvement over the third movie, of which the only thing I remember about it was that Wilbur from ""Mr. Ed"" starred in it as a supporting character.

That fact alone is going to make people today automatically stand loud and proud in fierce defence of this movie, regardless of the film's actual content. A familiar problem in today's world unfortunately, at least it's not made by the big D tho so people who don't like it at least won't be called any atrocious and unjustified names simply because they don't like a franchise's content. Anyway all that silliness aside keys get down to it from an honest opinion of a life long fan of the franchise, and yes I say franchise as I was 13 when BHCop3 came out and I loved it and still to this day don't understand all the hate part 3 gets! Go watch it again and tell me it's not a fun movie! People are too harsh on films they seem to forget that these films are supposed to be 'silly Action comedies' not Gladiator! Are you telling me any events from the beloved BHCop1&2 were supposed to be realistic and fact based? Cmon people! Lol sorry went on a bit there, so 40 years after the original and 30 years after the last film we get this new entry in the franchise, is it good? Yes. Is it great? Very much a no unfortunately. The film starts out great with Eddie being Eddie and being very funny, the opening chase is a throw back to the original 2 movies with action and homage soundtrack. I thought ""wow! This may actually be GREAT!"" Sadly the film starts to lose all these fuzzy old school vibes after the first 45 mins or so. The story starts to introduce too many characters and gets bogged down in everyone's subplots too much. I'm usually a big fan of Joseph Gordon but in this most of his scenes(the ones without Eddie banter) feel like he himself is bored of the character he's playing. The main plot of the film feels like it's about the father-daughter-relationship, in this day and age it feels appropriate(over-used and cliche as in most films) and it makes the movie DRAG BADLY! The actress that plays the daughter is pretty much one dimensional with her acting and again constantly reminds the viewer how they wish she wasn't so vital in the script. Honestly you'll find yourselves rolling your eyes at most of her dialogue! You'll also find yourself wondering why they didn't just use more of Taggert and Rosewood instead! It's GREAT to see the old gang back together but honestly, it's quite a stretch in terms of the over complicated plot. It feels like the latter two are just shoehorned in for the nostalgia. I honestly got so bogged down in the multiple irrelevant scenes just giving the daughter an over abundance of screen time I forgot about Rosewood and his subplot completely! I knew the film had failed somewhat when I was checking the runtime after about the hour mark. I wanted to LOVE this film SO MUCH! But in all honesty if it didn't have Axel Foley in it this really would be ANY OTHER GENERIC action flick, Eddie does just about save it. The first act is great, the second act feels like watching paint dry and they only just bring it back to be entertaining in the final act. My advice to the film makers if they do a part 5, REMEMBER THE FILM NEEDS TO BE FUN!!! You nailed the first 30 mins but then lost your way with TICKING too many corporate boxes! Just make a fun action comedy where you put all your skills into the writing, making the action original and great and making the comedy hilarious, it's not hard! You did it three times previously! This film does very much succeed in one thing tho, making you want to rewatch the originals. The best scene of the film is at the very end where Axel, Taggert and Rosewood are back in a car together in their classic positions, this scene will just remind you that this is actually what most fans wanted from the film! The soundtrack is one big homage to the previous films, even using some of the same 80s tracks which was a nice touch. Overall it is worth a watch but maybe if you're expectations are lowered than my fanboy ones were, maybe you'll enjoy it more. It's not a bad film at all, just more of a slightly wasted opportunity. Eddie is GREAT when the script allows him to be, as are others. Is this the triumphant return of Detroit's most loved wisecracking cop? Only just is the honest answer. Thanks for reading and I honestly hope those of you excited for this film do enjoy it, I just feel it coulda/shoulda been better.

280180,No summary,"Netflix's latest offering, Axel F, featuring Eddie Murphy, is an unfortunate slog through a once vibrant character's story, now marred by uninspired storytelling and lackluster performances. This sequel, meant to reignite the charm of the iconic Axel Foley, instead extinguishes any lingering fondness fans might have had for the franchise.Eddie Murphy, a powerhouse of charisma and wit, seems to be phoning it in. His performance lacks the spark that made Axel Foley a beloved character. The plot plods along, failing to capture the high-octane energy that the earlier films effortlessly delivered. Instead of thrilling car chases and clever detective work, we are treated to a series of mundane scenes that do little more than fill screen time.However, the real black hole of this film is the performance of the actress playing Axel's daughter. Her acting is wooden and unconvincing, draining any potential emotional weight from her scenes. It's as if the casting directors scoured the world for the least engaging performer they could find and handed her a crucial role. Every line delivery is flat, every attempt at emotion feels forced, and her presence becomes a tedious chore for the audience to endure.Adding to the film's woes is its reliance on tired race humor. What might have been edgy and provocative in the 80s now feels stale and uncomfortable. The jokes land with a thud, more cringeworthy than comedic, as the script lazily leans on stereotypes and outdated tropes. It's a stark reminder that humor evolves, and what once might have been a sharp social commentary now comes off as insensitive and uninspired.Axel F is a painful exercise in nostalgia gone wrong. Eddie Murphy's lackluster performance, coupled with an abysmal turn by his on-screen daughter and a script that relies on outdated race humor, makes this film a bore to sit through. For those hoping to relive the glory days of Axel Foley, it's best to stick with the originals and let this latest installment fade into obscurity.",3.0,GrumpyMovieBuff,2024-07-05,20.0,19.0

It's just slightly more watchable than Coming 2 America, which is definitely not saying much. Kevin Bacon used to be a good actor, but he's absolutely horrible in this movie.

280180,No summary,"I was looking forward to watching the fourth part in the series since Eddie Murphy used to be my favourite actor. I have to admit that my patience has paid off!!! Even though many of Netflix movies are bad, this one didn't look at all like a Netflix movie ! It was funny, with lots of action and great music ! I was not bored even for a minute! Addie Murphy does not age at all unlike others actors who didn't take care of themselves so well. Even GordonLewitt looks much older- ""at least use some sunscreen and emollient cream man!"" . For me this was the only sad part of the story. But the main actor , Eddie Murphy is finally back to action like in the past.I also liked several things about the movie. Some scenes looked very 80's like , such as the drive to the Beverly Hills which was very evidently shot still with a green screen , the 80's music and the action scenes. The scenario was also 80-90s-like, as the ""police-comedy /action-comedy' films at that time. The combination of modern technology and cameras with 80s features gave to the film the desired effect without making it look cheap and fake.",10.0,thstefanis,2024-07-05,8.0,5.0

The cast is amazing with lots of familiar faces, the action will keep you on the edge of your seat. The soundtrack is very clever, its compliments the movie perfectly.

I waited decades for the next BHC movie and now that it's here, I am sad to report it's a disaster on many counts.First and foremost: the script is terrible.The story is hard to follow. There's not enough there to make us care about the plot. The pacing is off. Many scenes should have been cut.The writers didn't do enough to rediscover Axel's character.Eddie Murphy also fails to embody the cool confidence of Axel.Rosewood barely has any screen time, and suddenly we find him tied up near the end... how did that happen?There are so many vehicle chases it's ridiculous. The movie should have been called: ***Beverly Hills Cop: Commandeered Vehicles***.Lorne Balfe's score is barf. He throws in a bunch of songs from the first two films... because I guess they didn't want to do any real work to find appropriate material to use. This use of songs from the other films is a microcosm of the entire film -- random bits of nostalgia from the original films are thrown in without any thought or care.I'm a big fan of Eddie Murphy and the BHC films.

Ashley: ""So, Axel. Oh wait. Oh my god. Axel? Ashley? Together we'd be Actually!"" (laughs)There's a scene where Taggart says the line, ""Here we go again!"" And yes, 40 years after the original ""Beverly Hills Cop"", and 30 years after the latest installment of ""Beverly Hills Cop III"", we are finally given the 4th installment into this storied franchise. Three decades has passed since Axel Foley has been on the silver screen. A LOT has changed in that time. Would they be able to create the same magic that we remembered feeling (for those of us who were alive back then)? And for a new generation, would it be modern and viable enough to make it worthwhile? I was truly hoping so.Axel Foley (in his 60's now) is still working the streets in Detroit and still driving that beat up, old Nova, while his peers are contemplating retirement or are no longer on the force. His old buddy, Billy Rosewood, calls and asks him to come back to Beverly Hills where Axel's estranged daughter, Jane, is in hot water with a corrupt Police Captain and her life is in danger. Despite his differences with Jane, Axel once more finds himself in the land of glitter and sunshine fighting off bad guys while using his usual quick wit, sharp mouth, and antics - all while trying to patch up his relationship with Jane.First ... the music and soundtrack was spot on. When I first heard the Intro to ""The Heat Is On"" playing, I smiled. You can't help but smile. It's Eddie Murphy - Axel Foley - the Beverly Hills Cop ... back in action! The throwback music continued. We get treated to all of the hits from the previous movies, bringing back the nostalgia in a big way. Eddie Murphy looks great in this film. John Ashton is in his mid-70's now and looks every bit his age, and in his 60's, Judge Reinhold didn't look much better. And they brought in another actor from that generation with Kevin Bacon, who is starting show his age now too. Infused with these ""old guys"" were some younger faces and names with Taylour Paige as Jane, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as her ex-boyfriend and a police detective. Unfortunately, that is pretty much where the smiles ended as this movie progressed.There's another scene where Axel is in a hotel lobby at the desk about to go into one of his routines when he suddenly stops and says to the clerk, ""You know ...to hell with this. I'm just too tired. Do you have any rooms available?"" That's how this film felt to me. Tired. Even though it is well produced and polished and looks and sounds good, the magic was gone. For two hours I watched these older actors trying to catch up to their younger selves and they never do catch them. They had fun making it, but honestly, they probably had more fun making it than I did watching it. Axel Foley just seemed so out of place ... and looked like someone trying to be witty and funny, but it is no longer selling. Nobody's buying.I can't recommend this movie. It really wasn't bad and it's entertaining for 2 hours, but it misses the mark of the previous films. At least it was better than ""Coming 2 America"" was.

280180,No summary,"The original Beverly Hills Cop was the first R rated movie my mom took me to so it holds a special place in my heart. Eddie Murphy's portrayal of Axel Foley was special. He wasn't acting like Foley he actually became Foley. The original showed the world the force Eddie Murphy could/would become. Unfortunately for us, especially as his fame grew so did the ego and the poor choices in the movies he was making. BHC 2 was just the ok. Murphy mailed in a forgettable performance in a movie with little point. 3 was a pile of garbage that I consider one of the worst movies ever. 4 was just OK, nowhere near close to the original and not puke-worthy like 3. It was just another movie that much like the past sequel, wasted another opportunity to give Murphy a chance to make the character special again, and once again we are subjected to a so-so waste of time. I put this right up with the revisiting of Top Gun. In theory it was a great movie, but looking deeper you just see a money grab using properties of a by-gone time. Creed, in my opinion is the only recent rehash that did it right. It's a shame that 40 years later, yes I said 40 years, Murphy and whoever decided to make garbage instead of building on the greatness of a classic from 1984.",6.0,bittertim,2024-07-05,7.0,9.0

The acting is so forced it makes you cringe. It's like every actor didn't want to be there and is making themselves to do it because there was some sort of contractual obligation. The story about Beverly Hills Cop 3 was that Eddie Murphy was depressed and wasn't in a good headspace to do the movie, but this movie feels the same. It's the same old lines delivered with less enthusiasm. It's the same music, the same gags, the same characters, the same formulaic story lines and the same tired cliches. It's not a good movie. 4 stars was being generous.

280180,No summary,"First of all, I had 0 expectations for this film -0; however, time has shown us that Netflix productions don't feel cinematic and have a, what's the word? Oh, yeah, cheap feel. This cheapness is apparent from the beginning of Axel F. It's like a parody of a classic. Better yet, it's like a car insurance commercial that ties in classic movie characters. Take the beginning of the film; the cop exalting Axel at the hockey game looks and acts like a random YouTube dude reviewing 80s movies. From that very moment, I knew that I'd have a difficult time being immersed.The thing that makes the original BHC so special, aside from the period, is the fact that the story is simple and develops in a natural way. This immediately gives way for its snappy pacing. That's not even remotely the case for this movie. Axel F (2024) simply drags in more places than one. So, now, on top of the dragging, we have Eddie Murphy who clearly lacks the panache that we know and love. I get it, he's not a 20 something year old anymore. He's made it in the entertainment industry and now anything that he's involved in is basically a post-career bonus. That's all fine, but it shows, WAY too much. Since I had such a difficult time being drawn in, even the presence of other classic characters meant very little to me.Sure, musical cues and songs from the original are peppered throughout the film, but it's just not enough to beef up this stale outing. The film tries too hard to be nostalgic while being ""reinforced"" with cliches. I was already having my doubts, but when Axel's estranged and unlikable daughter is actively thrown into the mix, it nearly completely killed the mood. Axel is one of the only action/comedy characters that doesn't need a romantic partner to thrill the audience. When he admits to his daughter that he's celibate, that's the most on point line in the film: we don't need a daughter, we don't need a wife, all we need are Axel's quips and wit.Bruckheimer had 30 years to get it right, but just like so many other franchises, it seems that the ship has sailed. I don't know if I chuckled more than twice in 2 hours. When Serge appears for the first time in BHC 1, I don't know if I had ever laughed that hard in my life. By the point at which he appears in Axel F, I was already like ""cool, yeah, Serge..."" And sorry, Billy Rosewood is vital to a BHC film, so having that character practically absent is a crime. I haven't even mentioned Joseph Gordon-Levitt or Kevin Bacon, but what's the point?I know this isn't Bergman, Fellini or even Marty Brest, but calling this a sequel to at least 1 and 2 is embarrassing. BHC 1 and 2 are feel good movies of their time. If we want a nostalgia fest, we may as well invest in Comic Con tickets. There is virtually no originality in Axel F and it looks like yet another film where corners are cut, just to say ""look, we made a new sequel!"" In my opinion, it's only worth resorting to the seminal 1984 classic, whose script is tighter than a suspension bridge cable. The comedic timing is impeccable, Eddie is fresh, there's suspense, camaraderie, originality, and style. Number 1 is the benchmark, 2 follows suit, and that's about that. I give Axel F a 3 for a few brief moments, but hiring a director whose debut is a sequel, to a classic franchise, and bringing it to the TV screen, nonetheless, via Netflix, is worse than any crime committed by Detective Grant (Kevin Bacon), in this mess of a film.",3.0,vukaroo,2024-07-05,0.0,7.0

However in the new installment that is no more as eddie is too old. It is a shame but you can hardly blame anyone for him ageing however I can blame the person who decided to wait this long for another film. The comedy is noticeably missing there are alot more serious discussions and alot more somber moments. It is a shame as I can watch the previous films and still laugh but I didn't laugh once during this movie. It was too serious with the daughter and the lack of screen time shared between the old trio. Alof of the old cast have very little screen time and very few lines. It is a real shame this was made so late. If this was 10 years ago we may have had a more physical and engaging story instead we have alot of talking about some past childhood and how sorry axel is for being a bad dad.This movie is mainly focused on some child axel had years ago and the relationship that broke down between the two.. the only thing making this movie worth watching is the old cast and a few throwback moments.This movie is a disappointment for fans of the old movies. The humour and spirit is missing that was once there. Before axel was a rebel who escaped everything and was able to use his wit to weasel out of a bad spot however as demonstrated within the movie when he trys to do the not paying for a room at the hotel he says ""screw it im too tired "" and gives up trying to fleece the hotel and getting a room for free. It is nice that the movie doesn't try to hide the fact that these guys are now old but it doesn't mean we should miss out on the comedy..We didn't even get a scene of axel going to a strip club like how you gonna stick the old trio in a movie and not put them in a strip club?",4.0,Allsaints112,2024-07-04,1.0,10.0
280180,No summary,"If you're not constantly reading the relevant gazettes, the latest sequel comes relatively out of the blue. After the dull Zamunda rehash, expectations are naturally relatively low. Anyway, film off and a first aha: this is what the late 80s / early 90s looked like (well). The first familiar faces. All people are the same, yawn, and all the actors have of course aged incredibly over the last 30 years, except for the man with the black genes. So in this respect, the next cosy nostalgia factor. More of this, et voila! Original score on a continuous loop, an obviously motivated Eddie Murphy, a refreshing new buddy team in the form of his (role) daughter and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a high gag density with a pleasant hit rate, plenty of action that keeps the pace high. Spirit, the magic word. In most cases it can't be reproduced, but here it can be felt in every minute. It's a shame, unfortunately it wasn't enough for an exciting screenplay, but if a Bad Boys makes it there, this film undoubtedly belongs in the cinema.

Sadly, there was zero Murphy ad libs that I could perceive (and no lines funny enough to be an ad lib) and none of his wonderful impressions. So okay, we have Eddie the trouble maker from Detroit, and his old cop pals still there but with a new young one (Gordon-Smith). But unlike the original which, despite all the humor, presented a solid plot (and such a refined bad guy), the plot here was very muddled. Nothing refined, just a bunch of interchangable bad looking dudes, many speaking Spanish with tats --no good characters like ""Coz"", And they just did bad stuff, and shot up whoever whenever. Don't even know for sure what the whole plot was over, except for getting hold of something which was only important if the rest of the plot had stood up as a solid plot. I guess to evoke the original, there was all kinds of huge trucks being sped down roads, busting everything in the path -- early on and again later. To mimick the whole cigarette-carrying truck from the original. But seemed half the movie was cars or trucks crashing other cars or trucks, which filled in for plot. That plus Foley's relationship with his daughter was the movie pretty much. Not even any good at-the-station scenes (so many good ones in the original with Ronnie Cox).

The current cinematic landscape is littered with failed sequels and remakes.Thankfully, we lucked out this time because Eddie Murphy loves Axel Foley as much as we do. His involvement as a producer ensured the character remained strong and true to his roots.""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F"" is a nostalgic trip down memory lane, filled with the same humor, action, and charisma that made the original trilogy a hit. Murphy slips back into the role of Axel Foley effortlessly, delivering his signature one-liners and over-the-top antics with gusto. The supporting cast, which includes Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Paul Reiser, and Bronson Pinchot, also reprise their roles, adding to the film's nostalgic appeal.While the plot may not be the most original, it's a serviceable vehicle for Murphy's comedic genius and the film's action-packed set pieces. The film's humor is a bit more subdued than the original trilogy, but it still manages to elicit plenty of laughs. The action sequences are well-choreographed and exciting, and the film's soundtrack, featuring a mix of classic and new tracks, is a perfect fit.Overall, ""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F"" is a fun and entertaining film that will satisfy fans of the franchise.

280180,No summary,"The first Beverly Hills Cop film marked Eddie Murphy's great breakthrough in 1984 and since then the comedy actor has been featured in numerous successful films. Yet it became a bit changeable around the millennium and one film was less enjoyable than the other. For example, films like The Nutty Professor were still fun, but certainly the sequel to Coming to America was not to peep at. With fear and tremble, we are already facing this fourth part of the Beverly Hills Cop- series. In addition to Eddie Murphy, old acquaintances like Judge Reinhold as Rosewood and John Ashton as Taggart return to the film. Additions are Kevin Bacon and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, so in that respect it gives a bit of hope that this can become something. Director Mark Molloy is an unknown to me, but well, that doesn't have to be a problem, it's not that Netflix has proven more than once that they can make series well, but that the movies from the Netflix stable are often not to peek on.Before this film was given the green light, the intention was to make a TV series by Beverly Hills Cop. In the pilot that was made, Eddie Murphy was the police boss and his son the detective. This film was launched exactly 30 years after part 3 and 40 years after part 1. Surprisingly, the atmosphere is immediately in it. In terms of music, the 80s style is completely adhered to and that looks away wonderfully. This is a worthy sequel, it is as fixed as a house. The film has everything on board, a lot of action, humor and the reunion of old acquaintances. The opening of the film immediately sets the tone as Axel Foley keeps home with a snow shovel through the streets of Detroit. It's actually immediately reminiscent of the first film and it's really cool that they kept the 80s style in the film. As you get further into the film you will notice that this part surpasses all sequels, it is actually just like the new Bad Boys films, the creators have remained true to the original films.Eventually, Axel returns to Beverly Hills when an attack on his daughter's life is made by the Mexican cartel. Then her ex appears on the scene in the form of detective Bobby Abbott played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Abbott is actually becoming a bit of Axel's buddy and the chemistry between Murphy and Gordon-Levitt is fantastic and really works very well. Eddie Murphy in particular shows that he hasn't left it yet, something we haven't been used to from this actor for a while, just look at the dragons from movies like Candy Cane Lane or Coming to America 2, for example. Towards the end, the entertainment only increases and the scene with the helicopter that causes a lot of destruction is a very entertaining one. If one continues on this foot, the fifth confirmed part is certainly welcome, but as far as I'm concerned, they are even allowed to sing out a sixth part. Axel Foley still hasn't lost his strength in 2024 and luckily Netflix hasn't messed it up.Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is perhaps the best sequel the series knows. Well, after Beverly Hills Cop III may not be that hard to do, but it's still handsome. The chemistry between Eddie Murphy and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is fantastic and it is also a joy to see all the old acquaintances from the old series back in their roles. The film quickly found the right vibe and that is mainly due to the use of the music in the film that knows how to give you a completely 80s feeling. There's nothing lacking in action and humor and it's super nice that Netflix didn't mess up the Beverly Hills Cop franchise, but made it true to its predecessors. A fifth part has already been confirmed and if they continue on this foot, even a sixth part may come. It's actually just like in the Bad Boys- series that Beverly Hills Cop really fits into this time and Eddie Murphy shows that he can still play a really good role.",7.0,michvanbeek,2024-07-04,3.0,5.0

The cartel meeting was a good scene as well with lots of hidden jokes and reminders. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Laughing is a good work out.,8.0,kqxffjdks,2024-07-04,5.0,3.0
280180,No summary,"So much fun, with great nostalgia bringing back Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Paul Reiser, and especially Bronson Pinchot's Serge. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Kevin Bacon are good additions. Everything you'd expect from a Beverly Hills Cop movie (including over-acted, over the top villains, great car chases, and funny quips).Of course it's predictable and implausible, but that's not why you watch. At the end of the day, all of these aging actors still look good. Maybe it wouldn't be as much fun if you hadn't seen the original film, but who hasn't seen the original?

You will see a photo of Gil Hill on the wall in memory of him as the Police Chief who has left us.The story line of the film progressed in a way that you totally overlooked that this film was close to two hours long.

I was thinking.. if this is how the first Beverly Hills movie looked like? If we as audience had just different standart back then. So I watched Beverly Hills again.. and no we did not!First Beverly Hill was clever movie. Basically all characters acted reasonable and the actions scenes were quite realistic compare to this. Axel was clever and confident cop. Who just wasn't trusted since he was young with not many experiences. And he was not trusted in Beverly Hills where they didn't know him, so he had to build the trust.But here he is the old cop with all those experiences, but they still dont trust him, cause he is acting like 20yrs old kid who destroys whole city with garbage truck.. I mean seriously? Why they couldn't wrote script that it would fit characters more? With less ""dope"" action scenes.It could be much more about him being clever and experienced cop and about young new cops not believing, that he still has it in him. It would be so much more interesting. If he showed his skills from first movie, but acted more to his age.",4.0,vorel40,2024-07-04,27.0,26.0

With all of the unsatisfying, rudderless garbage produced by Hollywood in the last couple of decades, I almost consistently walk out of theaters disappointed and ranting about how there's either no new thoughts in Hollywood or how the writers/directors/producers of sequels must've either never seen or hated the original films, whose torches they're carrying.

280180,No summary,"""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F"" is the sequel to the action comedy film ""Beverly Hills Cop III"" and the fourth film in the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" franchise. Directed by Mark Molloy and starring Eddie Murphy, Taylour Paige, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, and Kevin Bacon, it successfully recaptures most of what made the series so fun in the first place by making great use of its setting and characters.Thirty years after the events of ""Beverly Hills Cop III"", detective Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) still patrols the streets of his home city of Detroit, becoming something of a minor celebrity among the local citizens. One day, Axel learns that his estranged attorney daughter Jane (Taylour Paige) is now in danger due to her client's criminal background, and decides to venture back to Beverly Hills to investigate further. Upon arriving, Axel reunites with his old friends John Taggart (John Ashton) and Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold), who inform him that Jane's client has links to a conspiracy involving a large criminal enterprise encompassing the entire state of California. After Rosewood is suddenly abducted, Axel teams up with a reluctant Jane and her ex-boyfriend detective Sam Abbott (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to bring down this illegal operation and save Rosewood's life in the process.If there were ever a character who truly encompasses the full extent of Eddie Murphy's talents, look no further than Axel Foley, the protagonist of the popular ""Beverly Hills Cop"" franchise. Since making his debut four decades ago, Axel Foley has endured on as one of the most memorable comedic characters of 1980s cinema, and is in my humble opinion, Eddie Murphy's very best role. With his street-smart attitude and a catchy background theme to boot, it's hard not to be charmed by Axel's presence whenever he is on screen thanks to that signature Eddie Murphy energy we all know and love. After 30 years of multiple attempts at a franchise revival, the future of Axel Foley appeared in doubt, especially since the third film in the series fell so short of many people's expectations. Now after all this time, we finally have a fourth entry in ""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F"", a solidly entertaining return to form for both Eddie Murphy and the series as a whole.In a similar vein to the mutually belated sequel ""Top Gun: Maverick"" (interestingly, both films were produced by Jerry Bruckheimer), the film begins by showing our lead character still at the top of his game, with age hardly slowing him down at all. We see Axel Foley attending an ice hockey game with a younger white cop who idolises him to the point where the latter nervously tries to avoid saying anything that could be misconstrued as racist. As to be expected, Axel chooses to string his underling along only to later admit he's just playing him for laughs. It is soon revealed that Axel is only at this event to catch a group of criminals operating within the locker rooms, leading to a fast-paced chase sequence that results in a great deal of collateral damage and comedic banter along the way. This opening does a very good job of establishing how Axel has been able to remain so relevant for such a long time, as his classic unorthodox approach to tackling a situation is still serving him well even to this day, despite some of the usual setbacks.However, unlike ""Maverick"", which kept its 80s roots to a minimum, this film happily plays into every bit of 80s nostalgia it can find, but in a way that actually works to its advantage. For instance, Lorne Balfe's musical score brims with an intense, upbeat 80s-style synthesiser, giving the old ""Axel F"" theme a more slick and impactful effect on a scene when necessary. Additionally, director Mark Molloy pays homage to the cinematography of the original film, in an updated sequence showing how much different Beverly Hills is from Axel's home city of Detroit. Even the chase scenes and shoot-outs have a decidedly 80s flavour to them, with quick-cut editing and humorous situations involving the characters. In most other films that capitalise on the tropes of the past, these types of references would come across as a desperate attempt to appeal to older audiences, but here they are done in such an affectionate and fun way that they end up enhancing its entertainment value. After all, you've got admire a film that can make a chase scene with a comical three-wheeled parking officer's vehicle look intense.It may have been 30 years since he last played the role, but Eddie Murphy proves any doubters wrong that he no longer has it in him to reprise one of his most iconic characters for the audiences of today. Though he is now well into his 60s, Murphy nonetheless demonstrates a surprising amount of manic energy that has been sorely missed over the past several years, and he never once misses a beat. As mentioned earlier, Axel Foley remains as quick-witted, motor-mouthed, and profane as he was decades ago, refusing to let time wear him down too much. Something I've always loved about Axel's character is that in addition to providing comic relief, he's also a highly efficient detective, using his own unique street-smarts to solve a crime in a style that no other cops would ever be able to replicate. As a result, we have the perfect balance between a character whose jokes we can laugh at and one we can take seriously if the situation calls for it. Very few actors would be able to play such a role in this manner, but Eddie Murphy once again pulls it off with flying colours.The supporting cast, both old and new, also compliment the film rather nicely here as well. As Axel's daughter Jane, Taylour Paige manages to stand out alongside Eddie Murphy, without ever once trying to upstage him. Although I was annoyed at first with how she starts out as the typical ""I hate my father"" estranged daughter character, over the course of the film Jane does grow to appreciate him as an important asset to her investigation. You can tell that while Jane still resents her father because of his questionable decision-making in the past, there's a part of her that wants to forgive him and invite him back into her life. There are even moments where you tell she is definitely Axel Foley's daughter, with her determined attitude being one of her most obvious character traits.I also liked the addition of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Kevin Bacon to the cast, whose combined presence in the film fits seamlessly into the story. It is clear that Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character Bobby is intended to represent the modern day cops who have become more lax in their investigative strategies, as opposed to Axel's more raw, unabashed approach. Watching Bobby learn from Axel throughout the story leads to some humorous and interesting character dynamics that help bridge the gap between the policing of the past and present. On the other hand, Kevin Bacon looks like he's enjoying himself in the antagonistic role of Captain Grant. Without giving away too much, Captain Grant is a nice throwback to the corrupt police officers of classic cop thrillers, using his connections to the criminal underworld to try and skim some off the side for himself.For fans of the original three films, John Ashton and Judge Reinhold both return as Taggart and Rosewood, whose roles in the previous entries were the ideal straight men for Axel to play off comedically and dramatically. Though they each aren't in this film as often as I had hoped they would be, they at least contributed significantly to the plot and aren't simply cameos for nostalgia's sake. Taggart was always a by-the-books cop who never relented on police protocol and now that he's in the position of police chief, he is able to grant Axel otherwise top secret information regarding the case he is investigating. Likewise, Rosewood has had many years to step up in the world of law enforcement, adopting some of the useful strategies taught to him by Axel so long ago. It's great to see these two working alongside Axel again, although there are the occasional times where their advanced ages are quite obvious.As we continue to receive more belated sequels to classic IPs, we should take some comfort that ""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F"" avoids most of the mistakes that many others like it have made in the past. It keeps its main character front and centre, never allowing him to be upstaged by the younger, more energetic cast members, and it never relents on the exciting action sequences in favour of playing it safe. For those who were disappointed by the third film in the series, I can say that this one is a big improvement in nearly every regard. Reportedly, Eddie Murphy has confirmed that a fifth film is in development, which has me both concerned and curious as to where things will go from here.

During the 80s and 90s, a film such as this would come out and opening weekend would generate a flurry of excitement. A proper date night popcorn movie that everyone could then talk about the next day. That formula still works- think the recent Bad Boys box office success.But then Netflix takes a film like this, fills it by all accounts with nostalgia for that era, and sticks it online. Beverley Hills Cop comes out on a rainy Wednesday and just gets added to a watchlist. A non-event. This film should be in the cinema. So sick of Netflix and their attempts to kill off cinema, in this instance by directly trading off of nostalgia for the very thing it trying to kill.I just find it sad these days when a film comes out that good or bad would have had your younger self queuing around the block, whereas now we might glance at it a few weeks later when we have a spare minute one evening.",,daniju,2024-07-04,3.0,11.0

The return of a beloved character or franchise is a bit of comfort food that takes us back to a moment or a time when things were (or seemed) a bit simpler. It could also just be that Hollywood has forgotten how to make good, original content. I'm betting it's a bit of both.Most of these ""I'm/we're back!"" projects have been, at best, mid (I'm looking at you ""Ghostbusters""). So my expectations for ""Axel F"" were pretty low. I'm pleased to say that nostalgia and member berries aside, it's a pretty fun movie on its own,Make no mistake, nostalgia greases its gears at times, and there's precious little here that's fresh or inspired, but it's an agenda-free movie that only seeks to entertain.

280180,No summary,I'd thought this would be ok but it was an immensely fun ride. Murphy acquits himself well reprising his biggest hit role. Better than the last two sequels put together. Murphy looking a good 15 + years younger quips some genuinely funny lines and most of the rest of the cast has some funny bits too ( except Serge who was mostly cringe ). Some of the funniest lines came from the real estate agent. I found myself laughing quite a bit. Perhaps the last Bad Boys movie ( which I haven't seen ) might not be bad either since the one before that was atrocious. Some good action scenes and great pacing make this a very watchable affair. The ending feels a bit rushed with the usual nonsense of cops with handguns liquidating a bunch of bad guys with assault rifles but whatever.........one of the best things ( if not the best ) is the great theme music.

We all know that many sequels don't do as well as the originals, but it's not the case with this movie. The humor, intensity and of course, the Eddie Murphy charm are all still very much intact. The film does a great job bringing the special touch from the first installment into this one. There wasn't a moment where I was bored out of my mind with unnecessary dialogue, and was eager as the story kept getting more climatic! The ending was the cherry on top, as I can gladly say that this movie beat expectations. But, nothing will ever top the OG film from 1984.

280180,No summary,"Wow. Just wow! Eddie Murphy does it again as his one of a kind original character ""Axel Foley"" back again in this 4th sequel of the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" franchise and this one is just like going back in time and seeing this a year or two after the others instead of 30 or so years later, the same humor, action, craziness, super evil guys, and an excellent plot all done by Eddie Murphy himself. He's the one who put this together for all the fans. It's awesome he did this. Bronson Pinchot (Balkie Bartolomus) from ""perfect strangers"" plays ""serge''"" and it's exactly like his old Balkie role! Funny as hell. Nothing questionable, no nudity, a little foul language, some gun play and violence but no gore. If you've seen the other 3, you'll be really pleased that they did not loose their touch.

And while I know that a lot of twere excited for this movie, I was a little worried about it for one reason and that reason is Netflix. There have been a number of Netflix Blockbusters that have been ripped to shreds over the years, so I went into this movie with the right amount of expectations. After watching the movie, I can safely say that Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F (2024) was a great nostalgic return to form for this franchise.Positives for Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F (2024):
Eddie Murphy is once again awesome as Axel Foley. It literally feels like he hasn't missed a beat as this character. He's still firing on all cylinders with his fast witt and humor. I also enjoyed seeing both John Ashton and Judge Reinhold as the characters of John Taggart and Billy Rosewood. I also really liked the addition of Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Bobby Abbot and I enjoyed his buddy cop scenario with Eddie Murphy. Kevin Bacon was a blast as Cade Grant. The action sequences are awesome and they're just as good as the action in the first two movies. And finally, I appreciate the nostalgic route of this movie and it's one of the few movies where that approach actually works.Negatives for Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F (2024):
The main issue for me was that I didn't like Axel Foley's daughter Jane Saunders. While from an acting standpoint, Taylour Paige does a great job at giving the type of performance that she given to work with, I couldn't stand her character whenever she interacted with Axel Foley. And finally, there's a reveal towards the end of the movie regarding a certain character that was telegraphed from a mile away from the very moment they first showed up on screen.Overall, I had a nostalgic blast with Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F (2024) and that's all I was asking for.

280180,No summary,"This is a decent tribute to a classic action comedy.The writers know their audience, play safe with the formula, and essentially repackage it with ageing characters and a touch of young sex appeal amongst the supporting cast. I am Generation X and it works for me, but I suspect it might be less appealing to audiences who are not big fans of the original. No doubt there will also be reactions from those who hate nostalgia driven sequels.I like the opening dialogue at the hockey, which evolves into decent action sequence with reassuringly familiar feel. When the main plot kicks in it just about grabs me. The filmmakers sensibly use established characters to get you to care about the mystery, along with the family connection of the character Jane. I cannot say the crime element of the story is hugely compelling, but I find this to be the case in the original. It drives the plot so that we get Axel in various action-comedy situations that mostly hit the mark for me.What I find special about the original movie is the chemistry and banter between Eddie Murphy and the likes of Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Ronny Cox and Gil Hill. That is what makes it a classic for me. Does Murphy and the supporting cast of Axel F have the same edge and entertainment value? No, but it would be harsh to slate a film for not being able to turn back the clock a recreate the same magic. That being said, comedy is in the eye of the beholder, so if it depends on whether you find their performances and material funny or not as to how much you take from it. His chemistry with Taylour Paige is okay if you can get past the estranged father movie clichè.It is great to see characters like Taggart, Rosewood and Jeffrey back on screen with Axel. Ashton, Reinhold and Paul Reiser make a great contribution, particularly Ashton. All of this brought a smile to my face, particularly the final scene.It helps to have Kevin Bacon in a solid role that he could play in his sleep. He is charismatic as ever and another example of the filmmakers knowing their audience.Visually it is very reminiscent of the original and does feel like an 80s, buddy-cop movie set in contemporary LA. The action sequences are solid, with old fashioned shoot-to-kill violence from everyone including cops.The soundtrack is the icing on the nostalgic cake that is Axel F.6.5/10 for me but I round upwards.",7.0,snoozejonc,2024-07-03,7.0,9.0

280180,No summary,"Hard to believe its been 30 years since Axel Foley graced the screen in a movie. While Beverly Hills cop III was awful, Axel F is actually a good time. Its not up to the first two, but it certainly is better than the third one.Axel is still in Detroit causing mayhem when old friend, Billy Rosewood calls to alert him that that his estranged daughter, Jane, is in trouble. Jane is a Beverly Hills lawyer defending a young man who is accused of killing a cop. The cop was undercover and may have been exposing other corrupt cops. Axel takes off for California again. While trying to reconnect with Jane, he finds out Billy has quit the force and become a private detective, but is now missing after discovering a crucial piece of evidence. The rest of the movie is just call backs to the previous films. Some work, a lot don't.The cast is excellent. Murphy looks good for being 63 and still has a lot of charm. Judge Reinhold as Billy is nutty as ever. John Ashton returns as Taggert who is now chief of police. Also getting a promotion is Paul Reiser's Jeffrey, who is Axel's boss. Bronson Pinchot returns as Serge. Newcomers to the cast are Taylour Paige as Jane, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Jane's ex boyfriend, Detective Abbott, and Kevin Bacon as the slimy DEA Captain Grant. The cast foes a good job with the material, but can't quite raise it to the level of the previous films. I was so disappointed they didn't get Lisa Eilbacher to return and reprise her role as Jenny.I don't remember laughing out loud once. I smiled a few times. Many of the jokes were just mimicking events in the previous films (i.e. Billy holding up his badge and telling a dozen gunman to put down their weapons). The shootout at the end of the film is a direct ripoff of the shootout at the end of the first film. There is a fine line between homage and copying. BHC4 crossed the line into outright ripoff too often to be considered an homage. It was disappointing. After 30 years, they had plenty of time to flesh out new ideas while still doing callbacks.

280180,No summary,"Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F uses the Top Gun: Maverick formula to make a legacy sequel that can easily leap past the weakest chapter in this franchise without coming close to the Oscar nominated original that started it all. It's filled with callbacks to the original whilst nobly attempting to acknowledge the age of its characters and how times have changed since their last outing.This is the most animated Eddie Murphy has been in one of these since the first instalment. His ability to create a character on the spot and his fast talking nature make a triumphant return but are very front loaded so there's room for him to grow once he reunites with his daughter. Whilst Axel's journey isn't on the level of other recent returning characters, it's still a solid arc.It's nice to have Judge Reinhold & John Ashton back with Ashton in particular really making up for his absence in the last one. It gives equal screen time to its newcomers with Taylour Paige taking the thankless job of having to be the straight one, Joseph Gordon-Levitt being as likeable as always, and Kevin Bacon entertainingly playing a villain so obvious the film doesn't bother hiding it.Considering he's making his feature film debut with a $150 million franchise film, Mark Molloy does a good job overall. There are lulls in both the action and the comedy without it becoming boring and it's really satisfying to see the bottomless pit of Netflix money employed on some large scale practical destruction and impressive helicopter stuff.Composer Lorne Balfe finds greater success than his immediate predecessor in his attempts to remix Axel F throughout the film. In the rare moments it's not playing with that masterpiece, it's still keeping the synth elements alive and well with a soundtrack that's on hand to cover any nostalgia that's been missed by reusing most of the songs from the first film.",7.0,masonsaul,2024-07-03,8.0,10.0

280180,No summary,"Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) is still working as a cop in Detroit, Michigan taking on action-packed and chaotic cases while many of his colleagues are choosing retirement. Meanwhile in Los Angeles, California, Foley's estranged daughter, Jane Saunders (Taylour Paige), is working as a criminal defense attorney for a client, Sam Enrequez (Damien Diaz), who is standing trial for the murder of an undercover cop he claims he didn't commit. When Jane's life is threatened by masked assailants telling her to drop the case, Foley's friend Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) calls to let him know of the situation as he helps Jane gather evidence in his role as a private investigator having since left the force. Once back in Los Angeles, Foley learns that Billy is now missing with thugs now tearing apart his office which leads to Jane reluctantly teaming up with Foley to unravel a web of conspiracy and corruption centered around Captain Grant (Kevin Bacon) of the Beverly Hills Police Department's narcotics task force.Following the critical and commercial disappointment of Beverly Hills Cop III, Murphy made it known he wanted to make a fourth entry in the series in order to not leave the franchise on a sour note which he attributed to feelings of depression at the time that lead to him giving a lower energy performance (though John landis' slack direction certainly didn't help matters). For the past 30 years a continuation of Beverly Hills Cop has been bounced around between various writers, directors, and even formats with one incarnation being a TV series continuation, with Murphy reiterating his intentions for Beverly Hills Cop IV only for the project to re-enter development hell. The film eventually began to take shape in 2019 where after rights holders Paramount signed a licensing deal with Netflix for the film with an option for a fifth the film began production after some covid related delays with commercial director Mark Molloy making his feature directorial debut. Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F doesn't reach the level of the first film, but it's a massive improvement from the third film and has a better comic/action balance than the second.As with many legacy sequels there's a strong focus on characters aging and times having changed but despite Murphy having put on some years he still comfortably wears his Detroit Lions jacket and motor mouthed lies with gusto (ironically showcasing more energy here than he did the last time in the role). The movie sets itself on the right foot with its opening setpiece of Foley foiling a robbery using a snowplow (as well as causing considerable collateral damage) and the incorporation BHC 1 and II themes ""The Heat is On"" and ""Shakedown"" is well done and captures the energy present in the first two entries of the series. As expected, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F follows the same formula/trajectory of the prior three installments wherein someone close to Foley is targeted (in this case his daughter and Billy Rosewood) leading Foley to uncover a criminal conspiracy at or near Beverly Hills but it uses the formula to good effect and gives Murphy some opportunity to tap into more dramatic routes that really hadn't been explored since the first film.The movie features a solid cast with series staples such as Paul Reiser, John Ashton, Bronson Pinchot, and Judge Reinhold getting some good mileage out of their returns (though Reinhold is unfortunately MIA until the back half of the third act) and there's some strong comic setpieces that bounce off against Murphy with one particularly entertaining scene with Pinchot's Serge arranging a look at a mansion the group need access to which features some fun comedic work by Nasim Pedrad as the realtor. As with many legacy sequels the movie sometimes struggles in incorporating newer characters and with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Taylour Paige's characters you do kind of get the sense the writers put them in more out of obligation than any passion for these characters. While Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a good actor, the character of Detective Bobby Abbott feels so thin outside of a good sequence involving a stolen police helicopter that I routinely forgot the character's name. I also had issues with Taylour Paige's character Jane Saunders who does sometimes have some playful chemistry with Murphy, but for the most part the character is written mostly to be mad at, ignore, or be annoyed at Foley and it only serves to drag the movie particularly in the middle section and it only serves as a damper on the comic momentum. I don't necessarily blame the actors for this (though hiring an actress who's more known for dancing rather than comedy or improv may have been a mistake for a movie like this) and I feel like a lot of these issues probably could've been ironed out if they'd maybe merged those characters together rather than having them separate.In terms of action Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F certainly delivers on that front as it gives us a nice and varied set of memorable action beats that definitely lean more into the Tony Scott BHC II style rather than the grittier Martin Brest style from the first BHC. The helicopter sequence in particular does a nice job of balancing thrills and humor and it's a fantastic sequence. While the movie leans into Kevin Bacon's typecasting as the villainous creep, he does the role well even if it's not exactly setting the film on fire.I enjoyed Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F for what it was and thought it utilized most of the best strengths of the series. Murphy is having fun as Foley and there's a strong ensemble director Mark Molloy plays with mostly balancing their usage to good effect even if sometimes certain roles struggle with feeling more anemic than they should and could've benefited from further polish. If you're a fan of the first two Beverly Hills Cop films you'll definitely find a lot to appreciate.",7.0,IonicBreezeMachine,2024-07-03,8.0,11.0

However, I have this saying which is ""you can't please everyone, so you better pick your audience"". It feels as if the whole movie is driving on a 2 hours nostalgia highway in which it derails from it several times and then gets back on track again. I understand this try from today's cinema to mix the past with the present. Well, let me tell you something: it just doesn't work. You can't just put the 80s tone, then suddenly Netflixate it, then suddenly retro it again, that's not how it works and a nostaglic mind tends to reject that stuff. So yeah, some moments bring you back to those good old action-cop-fun movies, and suddenly you'll find yourself submerged in Netflix's signature and the same car-chase they put in absolutely in all of their stuff.I think there were many ways in which this movie could have been worse, much worse, and yet they managed to do something good here. It isn't perfect, it didn't fulfill all its potential, true, but lets also agree that these actors had to suit up once again inside the characters they made almost 40 years ago, so let's give them a big applause.I think the ""Theme"" could have been used slightly better, is one of the franchise's undoubted signature and would have added a lot of color to several scenes.Give it a shot!

280180,No summary,"Eddie Murphy is back as Axel Foley, 40 years after his first outing! Most of the original gang in fact is back - Taggart, Rosewood, an unrecognizable Jeffrey and Serge. I've seen BHC 1 & 2 countless times, I can quote them almost verbatim. The third was largely forgettable and a noticeable drop in quality so it was with some trepidation I heard that they were finally going to do a 4th installment. Eddie Murphy had repeatedly said over the years he'll only do it if the script is right but still, I always feared they would modernize it too much and miss the magic of the original.I'm happy to report they got it mostly right! It was just fun getting to see the characters again on screen after so long. Eddie Murphy slips back into Axel with similar sass and recklessness we remember him as, albeit with a little bit of a softer edge. Judge Reinhold and John Ashton haven't done many (if any) projects in the last 20+ years and they're used sparingly but the scenes with the three of them together just ooze chemistry and if anything I'd have loved there to be more! The new additions to the cast do a solid job too: Kevin Bacon just never disappoints but again, the script could've used him more. Joseph Gordon Levitt does a good job as the straight cop who eventually gets swept up in Axel's plans. We also find Axel has a daughter, Jane, who he's estranged from - it's a bit run-of-the-mill and we don't get too much of a backstory but in truth it's not what this movie is about, that's more of a side-story that gives Axel a bit of an arc to have during the movie. It's not an overbearing part of the plot and it helps give the movie a little extra heart.The soundtrack is very well done. It's got all the iconic themes and songs from the original that is just pure nostalgia and it plays such a crucial role in bringing the movie together.Nostalgia was always going to be a big draw for this movie, especially with so much of original cast back. Many movies can get it wrong by being too heavy-handed with it, but here (like Top Gun Maverick) I found it to be spot on; enough to put a smile on your face when you spot the throwbacks, but woven seamlessly enough into the story that it doesn't feel forced.They don't shy away from the fact that 40 years has passed, the style of movies (especially comedies) has changed for better or worse, but I think they did an admirable job in trying to make a 2024 action comedy feel like one from the 80s with enough refreshments so it doesn't just feel like a lazy copy yet keeps the charm of the original. It's a really delicate (nigh impossible) balance but they get much more right than wrong. It's quite a bit better than the 1994 third attempt (Joseph Gordon Levitt with a cheeky line in reference to it when he first meets Axel) and I'm glad we get to see the trio reunited one last time for some 80s shenanigans!",7.0,btzarevski,2024-07-03,189.0,36.0

If you haven't seen the first few films, you should watch at least the first two or even the original one before watching this movie. Some good 1980s style action and comedy mixed with modern cinematography. Impressed to see so many old characters back to continue the story. I absolutely love how much this movie makes fun of the current state of the state of California. This movie was a breath of fresh air after the last few years.

280180,No summary,"Over the last 20 years or so, there have been numerous failed 'regenerative callback releases' of movies based on intellectual property (IP) from the 80s, 90,s and early aughts. Most of them are based on comedies.They have all been disasters.Many of these movies have been made under Netflix. Netfux has sponsored the 'revival' of several movies (they're all crap, so I won't reference them) and TV series from the past (making the worst version of Arrested Development possible, and bringing back such forgettable atrocities that should have remained in the past, like 'Full House').It's these unremarkable - if not completely reprehensible callbacks for a quick buck - that helped me lose faith in what Netfux has to offer.Many of these original movies are banked by big name directors and stars, and end up being an embarrassing display of incompetence. Filled with awful CGI, phoned in performances and lackluster 'entertainment'.Basically, IP all over these IP callback projects.So now we have another comedy rehash from the 80s, with the big stars from the original movie coming back to regale all of us with their aged, uninspired, worthless cashed-in performances to help muster some quick bucks from the streaming audience.Strangely, though, this movie seemed to... be decent? In fact, I laughed out loud joyously at many moments. I noticed from the start that although some of the action seemed a little ""off"", there was a LOT of real-world stuntwork put into play. Eddie Murphy was actually TRYING to be funny (and working). He truly felt like Axel Foley, and not some actor just saying the lines for that fat paycheck. He seemed to actually give a crap.Add that to the rest of the cast. They ALL put in some effort, and showed a genuine desire to make this material work.And strangely, I have to say - for the most part, it DID work.I'm not saying this movie is perfect. For example, a simple shout out to the elementary flaws that make Netflix movies so strangely incongruent to the budget put into these movies is at timestamp 22 minutes, 23 seconds: How can his vehicle make a right turn from THE BACK WHEELS, and yet no one in the editing process realizes this is literally impossible?This is after an action scene where they put time and effort into making a rather impressive car chase with a snowplow that utilized a LOT of on location, in-camera stunt work!(?)!This is kind of a metaphor to the dichotomy that this entire movie represents: It does many things right. In ways that shows everyone put effort into making a great movie.But it fails in some of the simplest aspects that makes me wonder what the hell was going on during the entire creative process.The principle cast was great. Murphy showed real, genuine effort in pulling off that Axel F has a story to tell. Bravo, sir.The story is pretty simple. But that's ok, this isn't 'Lawrence of Arabia'. Essentially, it's a beat for beat retread of the first movie. You'll catch the scene by scene ripoff - sorry, I mean 'homages' - to his shenanigans from the start. But again, it's all in good fun with an energy and style that gives it a spin that works as a standalone product.The moment you meet Kevin Bacon you will be like, 'Oh. That's Victor Maitlin"".There are some nice additions to Foley being older now, having a child that he needs to reconnect with, and the complexities of her life and relationships that need to be resolved within the story. All simple, but effective.No surprises with this installment, but that's fine with me.There are flaws: It doesn't diverge enough from its source material (the first movie, basically) to make this into an original story. It does lean too hard on the 'Member Berries , IMHO. But again, I give kudos for this movie providing a respectful context to many of the callbacks in ways that recent 'reboots' and 'sequels' failed to recognize.Also, there are enough anomalies in production quality to make me wonder how they couldn't take those small quibbles and shape them into an even more refined and mature final product. I'll make a callback to my reference of the reverse-axle right turn shot at 22:23 during the movie... it's a very simple, very OBVIOUS oddity and yet no one took the little bit of time to shave off that rough edge to hone a beautiful, seamless curve....
This movie was on the verge of being great, but instead it became an alright movie. It has a great cast that put the energy, effort and heart into the material. The screenplay itself understands WHY people are so connected to the series, and finds ways to clutch onto that fandom, but isn't quite - just barely incapable of - being able to take off those training wheels and make a more original story that knows how and why the IP worked in the first place.So... with all this said... it was fun. It has heart. It doesn't belittle or bemoan the original cast or its characters. It knows why the original worked so well and went with that energy, yet fell short because it couldn't find its own voice.",6.0,kcmsterpce,2024-07-03,14.0,16.0

280180,No summary,"Eddie Murphy's latest film, ""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F,"" is a modern take on the iconic detective Axel Foley. The movie follows Foley from his beloved Motor City to Southern California, featuring a mix of old faces and new personalities. Axel, now known as Big Dad Energy, cements himself as Murphy's top cinema character. After a crazy-pants incident in downtown Detroit, Axel gets a call from his old buddy Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold), who has left the Beverly Hills police and is now a private eye investigating department corruption. Axel's estranged daughter Jane (Taylor Paige), an LA defense attorney, becomes embroiled in these shady shenanigans by taking on the case of a cop killer. Her life is threatened, leading her father to leave the next flight out. When Billy goes missing, father and daughter reluctantly team up to uncover the conspiracy, with the help of Jane's detective ex Bobby (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Director Mark Malloy makes his film debut with ""Axel F,"" which is interestingly self-aware, running down Axel's prior Beverly Hills escapades. The franchise borrows a page from the playbook of the similarly toned ""Bad Boys"" movies in recent years, building out the mythology with debuting characters. Kevin Bacon's shady Captain Grant gives him a complicated foil, while Gordon-Levitt gives Murphy a fun guy to banter with. Familiar players return in supporting roles, such as Bronson Pinchot's flamboyant realtor Serge, Paul Reiser's embattled Detroit police captain Jeffrey Friedman, and John Ashton's Axel pal John Taggart, now the head of the BHPD. One of the biggest disappointments is the limited screen time with original ""Cops"" stars Murphy, Reinhold, and Ashton, separated mainly by plot but energizing when all together. Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is a modern sequel to the original trilogy, featuring Eddie Murphy as the savvy and streetwise detective Axel Foley. The story follows Foley's defense attorney daughter, who is threatened with death unless she drops a case. The movie primarily pits Foley against a crew of dirty cops, which could be cut from any number of action movies made over the last four-or-so decades. However, it isn't a superficial re-tread of any one of them in particular.The movie begins with an immediate homage to the opening moments of the original Beverly Hills Cop, reintroducing viewers to Axel himself as he cruises through Detroit in his slightly less crappy, blue Chevy Nova. Murphy appears entirely at ease as Axel Foley for the first time since 1994, and his raw screen presence is not as outright remarkable here as he was throughout his unimpeachable performance in 2019's Dolemite Is My Name. The roles for other returning characters from the original trilogy are mostly modest but reappear in nicely logical ways. Jeffrey Friedman's reintroduction as Foley's superior officer is pitch perfect, while Judge Reinhold's Billy Rosewood returns as the sensitive, Sylvester Stallone fan we remember. John Ashton is also back as a now-unretired John Taggart, and Bronson Pinchot's brief but triumphant return as Serge is a major highlight. In conclusion, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is a smartly assembled continuation of the original trilogy, featuring Eddie Murphy as the savvy and streetwise detective Axel Foley.",10.0,moviesfilmsreviewsinc,2024-07-03,17.0,14.0

280180,No summary,"I rewatched the original movies (yes even the 3rd one) in preparation for this and all that it did was accentuate just how old and tired everyone is now.The thing that made the originals (well, the first two at least) so good, was that they struck the perfect balance between action and comedy, that and the great chemistry between the cast. Unfortunately whilst the film had some decent action points, it was considerably lacking in the comedy department. Instead of being a fun, quick witted, action romp with our 3 favourite cops, 2 of the said cops were sidelined for the majority of the movie (understandably in Taggart's case as the actor is now in his late 70s) and Eddie's performance was so laid back it felt like he'd just got out of bed most of the time.The story itself was also just a rehash of a hundred other films that we've all seen done before and better. Whether it's the bent cop, or the estranged daughter caused by the father's inability to prioritise his family over his job, we've been here, there was nothing new here.Honestly the film wasn't horrific by any means, Eddie did show moments of his quick witted former self and it was nice to see them all back together again (minus Ronny Cox), but unfortunately I feel as though they waited 10-15 years too long to make this one happen and the film suffered greatly for it.",4.0,danwilberforce,2024-07-03,15.0,44.0

Plus, Axel also gets a new police officer partner played by Joseph Gorden-Levitt.And I doubt it is a spoiler to say you know what role Kevin Bacon will have in this film. The plot is nothing new here: bad guy threatens good guy who then disappears, but before doing so sends message to old friend who comes looking to find same.What makes the film work is that Eddie Murphy surrounded himself with excellent actors, found a good story, and a good director. Eddie Murphy slides back into the Alex Foley persona and takes everyone on a great ""road-trip."" The sharp dialogue, the ""fish out of Beverly Hills"" juxtaposition, the ""friends"" in bad places-it all works thanks to Murphy.You will enjoy the villains because they are bad villains.

It was a terrible movie so I think this is why this new movie got so many things right.From using as many actors from the previous movies, almost an identical soundtrack it just worked. The fan service level was spot on.The back story to flesh out the last 30 years isn't complicated, just standard filler but again, it just worked.Seeing the gang back together was a blast, it's certainly worth a watch.

I'll watch it a few times again i'm sure.Great to see most of the original cast, and a bunch of familiar faces from other gteat shows too, so I'm really pleased with the casting!The music is mostly good too with tracks that we know from the original shows but with a few unwelcome additions by the likes of Lil Naz X. Why whoever keeps choosing to add such awful noises to films is allowed to carry on is infuriating in my opinion.Same problem with the new Bad Boys film Ride or Die. The music is awful and really takes away from the overall experience. Who actually listens to this noise, it's not music really. I wish they stop this nonsense. Especially when the main audience are the people who watched the films from the 80s and don't listen to this tripe. I can't even imagine children listen to this either.Anyway that's my mid-rant about recent film music, and not about Beverley Hills Cop 4 which I think is brilliant!

280180,No summary,"It's 30 years since Beverley Hills Cop III and Axel Foley rushes from Detroit to Beverly Hills to help his estranged lawyer daughter out after she asks for the financial records of a murdered cop following which her life is threatened. Foley looks up old friends and new to help his daughter out and bring down grinning, slimy corrupt cop Kevin Bacon.With its predictable plot and outcome assured, this stab at BHC 40 years after the original is nevertheless a lot of fun if you're a fan of the franchise and delivered very slickly. This one is better than II and III (I think they even have a knock at III) featuring well known characters from the other films and whilst many of them look a little long in the tooth to do this, the exception is Murphy. At 62, whilst he has slowed a little and is occasionally a little more philosophical, he looks terrific and there are many genuinely snappy funny lines. There is plenty of crash bang wallop of course involving trucks, cars, machine guns, buggies and particularly a helicopter which is very impressive.

1187058,No summary,"**Movie Review: A Visual Spectacle Without Substance**In an age where visual effects (VFX) can carry a film far beyond its plot, it's no surprise that some filmmakers lean heavily on spectacle to dazzle audiences. Unfortunately, the movie in question here is a textbook example of style over substance. While it does manage to deliver stunning VFX shots that would make any sci-fi or fantasy fan sit up and take notice, the rest of the film feels like a hollow attempt to cash in on visual grandeur with little concern for storytelling, character development, or originality.**Overacting at Every Turn**Right from the opening scene, it's apparent that subtlety was not on the director's checklist. The performances range from dramatically exaggerated to outright theatrical, leaving little room for nuance. The actors, though talented in their own right, seem to have been directed to go overboard at every emotional beat. Rather than connecting with the characters or empathizing with their struggles, the audience is left cringing at the over-the-top expressions, loud proclamations, and exaggerated gestures that plague nearly every scene.The lead character, in particular, feels less like a real person and more like a caricature of a hero, constantly throwing dramatic stares into the distance and delivering lines with an intensity that the thin plot doesn't warrant. Supporting characters fare no better, often becoming victims of melodramatic overacting, which only amplifies the film's overall sense of artificiality.**VFX: The Only Saving Grace**If there's one aspect of the movie that deserves praise, it's the VFX. The visual effects team clearly put in a lot of effort, and it shows. From breathtaking action sequences to meticulously designed fantasy worlds or futuristic cityscapes, the visual spectacle is stunning. These scenes are rich in detail and beautifully crafted, and for a moment, they offer a welcome escape from the film's otherwise painful execution. The explosions, the space battles, or the creature designs-whatever the genre-stand out and provide fleeting moments of excitement.However, even with these beautiful VFX shots, the problem is that they don't serve any deeper narrative purpose. They are there to distract, to make up for the shortcomings in every other department. It's a classic case of using visual marvels to cover up the cracks in storytelling, and while this might work for some, the charm quickly wears off once you realize there's little substance holding it all together.**A Plot Thinner Than Paper**The film's biggest downfall is its wafer-thin plot. It's so predictable that after the first 15 minutes, you can pretty much guess how the rest of the movie is going to unfold. There's little in the way of twists or surprises, and even when the story attempts to throw in some ""big reveal,"" it comes off as tired and cliched. The stakes feel low throughout, and the conflict never really engages the audience. At times, it seems like the filmmakers assumed that the spectacle of the VFX would compensate for the lack of narrative depth, but it doesn't. The story is simply too generic to hold anyone's attention for long.**Too Predictable to Be Enjoyable**Predictability in films is not always a bad thing; many successful movies follow familiar structures or tropes. However, the issue with this particular film is that it telegraphs every plot point well in advance. There's no tension, no mystery, and no intrigue. The characters move through the motions as though they're on autopilot, hitting all the usual beats you've seen in dozens of other movies-just done worse here. As a result, the film never surprises or challenges the audience, and it becomes more of a chore to sit through.**A Waste of Time**Ultimately, despite its visual splendor, this movie feels like a waste of time. With its heavy reliance on overacting, a plot that's barely present, and a predictability that drains any potential for excitement, the film fails to deliver on the basic elements of good storytelling. The VFX team might have delivered some incredible shots, but even they can't save the movie from the flaws in writing, acting, and direction.

280180,No summary,"In the recent wave of ""legacy sequels"" within the past half century, the general consensus have been hit or miss. However, there are a select few IPs that have been resurrected that have been done justice by either recapturing the creative lightning that struck twice or having the original characters passing the torch to the next generation. This film is a mix of the two concepts which ultimately makes this installment a return to form.30 years later. Detective Axel Foley is still on the streets of Detroit - running and gunning, solving cases the only way he knows how. Between his last visit to WonderWorld to the start of this film - the level of maturation that Foley has endured, especially throughout this film, is a welcome change of character as he solves a very personal case while reconnecting with his estranged daughter - Jane. Don't get me wrong, he is still the fast-talking super cop we all know and love. Axel brings the ""Dad energy"" while partnering with Jane, some new characters, and old buddies. To Eddie Murphy's credit, he did wait a long time for the right script to come along that continues his most famous character's story.With the resurrection of any beloved IP of any time period, many projects rely on the nostalgia and fan service. Here, the callbacks, Easter eggs, and nods feel natural and never forced. One component of the film that solidifies it's place in pop culture is the music - both the soundtrack and the score. Familiar needle drops from the first two installments are ushered by a score that honors the work of Harold Faltermeyer's iconic motif, culminating in Lil Nas X's 'Here We Go!' which ties the film together in a contemporary bow. The action sequences have surpassed their predecessors, in firepower and familiarity. The performances of all members deliver a peek of how life is for our beloved characters, 30 to 40 years later, while the new faces bring a fresh touch.Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F is a great example of a long-awaited sequel that had a story worth continuing an IP for. Like it's ""cinematic cousin"" - Bad Boys. It may not be the perfect sequel, but it is one of the most satisfying installments that succeds in recapturing the magic the IP is known for. An explosive, fun, self-aware, and touching triumphant return of our favorite Detroit cop, back where he does not belong.On a personal note - this film was worth a theatrical release.8 out of 10 Bananas in a Tailpipe.",8.0,rairamiro,2024-07-03,15.0,15.0

Buoyant, confident and playful in a way that most legacy sequels take for granted, it's exactly the kind of entertaining summer blockbuster that we need more of. Funny, action-packed, filled with heart and it's got Eddie Murphy proving once again that he's still got it. With fresh blood in the directors chair in the form of Mark Molloy, mixing the look and feel of Martin Brest and Tony Scott's outings, it all comes with a lavish quantity of 80s nostalgia with a distinctly modern feel. There's a renewed light behind Murphy's eyes with a healthy dosing of hilarity, simultaneously acknowledging this is the Axel we know and love just older and wiser. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a natural fit for the series while Reinhold and Ashton being more than welcome returns as their beloved characters although I wish we got more of them, hell, there's even a great deal of Kevin Bacon to marvel at. Lorne Balfe's score captures the sound of Harold Faltermeyer's works, feeling like a natural extension of his best works and the soundtrack is another winner with plenty of bops you'll be tapping your feet to.

280180,No summary,"The film commences with Axel Foley, now a seasoned Detroit cop, in a high-octane chase through the city streets. The action sequences are well-executed, providing a refreshing contrast to the prevalent overuse of CGI in many of today's blockbusters. The narrative then transports us back to Beverly Hills, where Axel's estranged daughter Jane, portrayed by Taylour Paige, finds herself in peril due to her involvement in a case concerning corrupt cops. The reappearance of familiar characters like Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and John Taggart (John Ashton) adds a touch of nostalgia. New additions to the cast, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Kevin Bacon, infuse a fresh dynamic into the narrative.This is more than just a legacy sequel; it's a testament to Eddie Murphy's enduring charm and comedic prowess. It's a film that doesn't shy away from addressing themes of aging and the treatment of veterans in law enforcement. While the film does indulge in its share of nostalgic callbacks, it manages to stand on its own merits. It surpasses the second and third films in the series, and it successfully encapsulates the spirit of the original while adapting to the expectations of a contemporary audience. In conclusion, ""Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F"" is a surprisingly entertaining film that successfully revives a beloved franchise.

I haven't seen the trilogy he started while studying at the Victorian College of the Arts, which kicked off with Uncle in 1996. After he graduated in 1997, he wrapped it up with Cousin in 1999 and Brother in 2000. However, I absolutely loved his next big project, Mary and Max, from 2009, and I've watched it three times. My review ended with: Beautifully weird animation for a gorgeous film!And here we go again! Adam Elliot has shown off his talent for animated films with Memoir of a Snail, a charming and touching look at life through the eyes of its delightful main character. While Mary and Max explores the deep bond between two unlikely friends, touching on themes of loneliness and connection, Memoir of a Snail takes a more reflective route, diving into the journey of self-acceptance and appreciating the little moments in life.Memoir of a Snail is a real win, cementing the director's status as a master storyteller in animated cinema. It showcases his knack for creating stories that are both fun and thought-provoking. Fans of Mary and Max will definitely enjoy this new film, as it captures what makes Elliot's work so unique-genuine storytelling, beautiful animation, and a celebration of the human (and snail) experience.

They carry a message.A Mistake is brilliant because it resonates on so many levels. It sheds light on the immense pressure hospitals and their staff endure, but what makes this film so universally relatable is its exploration of humanity.

1064486,No summary,"Wow, it's been a long time since a movie not only struck me straight in the heart but also resonated deeply with my very core.Set in 1970s Australia, the story follows Grace, whose life is marked by profound misfortune and loss. After their mother tragically dies during childbirth, Grace and her twin brother, Gilbert, are left to be raised by their paraplegic, alcoholic father, Percy, a former juggler. Despite a life filled with love, tragedy strikes again when Percy passes away in his sleep. The siblings are torn apart and placed in separate foster homes, forced to navigate an unforgiving world without each other.The animation is stunning, and the film handles heavy subjects-loss, physical disabilities, bullying, and alcoholism-with remarkable sensitivity and honesty. What makes it truly special is its balance: the humor woven into the script creates moments of levity that prevent the story from becoming overwhelmingly somber.This movie will particularly resonate with those who come from broken homes or have experienced childhood trauma. The portrayal of foster parents and the challenges foster kids endure is heartbreakingly accurate. I know because I am a foster kid.I needed this movie on a deeply personal level.

1064486,No summary,"The story is incredibly well-written, delving into the complexities of human emotions and the profound impact of trauma on an individual's life. Despite being a stop-motion animation, this film tackles themes that are deeply rooted in adult experiences, making it a thought-provoking piece far beyond the expectations one might have for the medium.It explores a rich tapestry of topics: the aching weight of loneliness, the transformative power of friendship, and the struggles of misfits and outcasts seeking belonging. The narrative weaves together themes of love, parenthood, childhood innocence, and the weight of societal constructs like religion and the scars left by homophobia.These heavy, introspective themes might mean the film isn't universally embraced, as it challenges audiences to confront uncomfortable truths and raw emotional landscapes. However, this is precisely what makes ""Memoir of a Snail"" such a masterpiece-it dares to be unflinchingly honest.I sincerely hope that more people give this extraordinary film a chance.

1064486,No summary,"Adam Elliot does it again, technically, but that's part of the problem. What felt fresh, funny, and genuinely moving in Harvie Krumpet and then Mary and Max is all kind of there in Memoir of a Snail, but nothing quite hit for me. I think it's the overwhelming, constant sadness that soon becomes numbing. You get a little comedic relief, but not as much as Elliot's other works, and what is comedic is more just mildly funny than surprisingly hilarious.His visual style is still intact, but the way it was written was lacking. Characters come and go and fade out of focus, and yes, that's life for you, but something about it just didn't work here. It's all I've got as for explanation why this didn't really move me; that, plus the fact that it's very one-note emotionally for a feature-length film.Sarah Snook's voice acting was also kind of bad, which is a shame because she narrates the whole thing. I get why they make her cry or express certain emotions in starkly realistic ways, but it didn't work for me with the way this looks. I liked the other voice performances though. The score was another thing I largely disliked, to be honest. It felt lazy compared to the animation.It does still look visually striking, and it feels like there was a lot of passion gone into it on a technical front. That stops Memoir of a Snail from being bad, but I wish it had been as good as the director's prior films. If he can't top those while sticking with his schtick, I'd like to see him break out and do something different. The whole ""outsider is isolated but perseveres the way they can while bad things happen and they make a few connections everything's kind of ugly"" thing wore me out here, and makes me wonder if Elliot can do anything else.This was technically good, but also disappointing considering the wait between films.

The movie is about a woman, Grace Pudel, reccounting her life's history to her pet snail Sylvia, hence the title. It's a bittersweet story that kind of overlaps with my experience as an autistic child, so it ressonates particularly deep with me, and follows Mary And Max's standards of representation of neurodivergent people in media.Also her brother is a pyromaniac, Awesome.The animation is stop motion of course. It has a palette slightly more colourful than Mary and Max but still dull enough to warrant a sense of ""antiquity"", since flashbacks take place in the 50's. The character designs are a lovely mixture of cute and gross, and there's well animated bodily fluids to go around.A fantastic recommendation.",10.0,calahao,2024-11-25,2.0,3.0

1064486,No summary,"Ouch....this one really hits home with me.After his masterpiece on Mary and Max, Adam Elliot comes back with another wonderful, beautiful, and humane animated movie that explores sibling bonding ship, hardships, complex life, and society.Filled with weird but interesting claymation designs, Elliot approaches on the narrative, tone and atmosphere, on a more darker level compared to his previous work. Exploring the dark aspects of society, while still remaining joyful, touching and emotional. Elliot's approach to the animation, characters, and themes are well-explored and thus creating a great character study of a piece. Being focused more on the complex of society and how characters are forced to deal with their surroundings and environment.Many of the voice performances are fantastic. As I mentioned, many of the characters are well-explored as you feel engaged with the characters and connect with them on an emotional level. What I love about Elliot's work is that he uses animation and character engagement in a unique way. Most animator's usually tend to focus on traditional approaches but Elliot explores more human and serious, as if this is what a real life experience is.With the writing, the dialogue is great, the soundtrack is good, and many of the themes and emotional elements really hit hard. I haven't felt this emotionally connected with an animated movie since Wolfwalkers, where a movie I genuinely cared about the characters and really feel for them.Unfortunately, I have a good feeling this movie won't be discussed a lot due to the heavy subject it explores and adult animation is rarely appreciated from the general medium.

They suffer some tragedies and are forced to grow up in separate houses in Canberra and Perth.Grace's backstory and her obsession with snails is done well, taking up most of the film, and while there's lots of depressing moments - and some odd/adult ones! - there's plenty of heart and silver-linings/hope that drives the story. Part of this is quirk Pinky (Weaver) and how she plays into the happy ending. I assume chunks of this film are inspired by Elliot's real life...Great voice cast, with Eric Bana, Tony Armstrong, Magda Szubanski and Nick Cave too.

1064486,No summary,"Greetings again from the darkness. If you believe that animated films should be whimsical fairy tales developed for children, Adam Elliot would like a word. Actually, he would like about 90 minutes of your time to introduce you to an entirely different approach with stop-motion animation. Elliot won an Oscar for his animated short HARVIE KRUMPET (2003) and also developed the excellent animated feature MARY AND MAX (2009). Not one to shy away from grown-up topics, Elliot's latest is a gem filled with most every emotion.Relying heavily on narration, the story is told by Grace Pudel (voiced by Sarah Snook, ""Succession""). It's her own life story, but contrary to what the film's title would have you believe, Grace is a person, not a snail (at least not a shelled gastropod). However, she is telling her story to her favorite pet snail, Sylvia. It's OK if that sounds a bit strange, because Grace and her story will draw you in and have you caring very much. The story starts at the beginning ... with Grace's premature birth ahead of her twin brother Gilbert (Kodi Smit-McPhee).Grace chaperones us through her early years. These were not easy years as mom died early on, and dad was an alcoholic paraplegic with sleep apnea. Mostly we learn about Grace and her collection (hoarding) of snails she kept in a glass jar with Vegemite for their nutrition. She tells us about her beloved brother Gilbert's love of animals, reading, magic, and fire. When their dad dies, Child Services sends Grace and Gilbert to separate foster homes in different parts of Australia. It's not just geography that makes a difference. Grace is fostered by a couple of self-help gurus who are also swingers (it's not a movie for kids). Gilbert is sent to live with a harsh religious cult family demanding work while offering no love.The twins maintain contact through letter-writing, and Grace fills in some of the details for us. Her story includes a romance with Ken, a neighbor who loves his leaf blower and has a certain fetish that takes Grace a while to uncover. She also forms a special bond with Pinky, and older lady (voiced brilliantly by Jacki Weaver) who teaches Grace to relish life. While Grace often lives inside a shell, much like her pet snails, she does treasure her time with Pinky, whose final letter is touching.This is an all-too-ordinary life told exquisitely (that's me trying to avoid saying ordinary and extraordinary in the same sentence). The emotions are overflowing and range from grief to sadness to frustration to anger to hope. Elliott includes nods to literature, roller coasters, Parisian street performers, guinea pigs, and nudist camps (possibly a first in the animated world). We also see the dark side of religion and the importance of friends and family. Grace truly lives the circle of life, as she learns that snails have no choice but to live in the shell under which they are born, but she does have a choice. The score from Elena Kats-Chernin is beautiful and fitting, and Elliot leaves us with this thought: ""Life can only be understood backwards, but we have to live it forwards.""

1064486,No summary,"Our family went to the movies last night to watch the Australian film 🇦🇺 Memoirs of a Snail (2024). The story follows twins who live their best life together with their dad-until he passes away, and they're separated by child services. They struggle to find their way in life, facing scams and exploitation, yet they always hold out hope of finding happiness again someday.Written and directed by Adam Elliot (Mary and Max), the film features the voices of Eric Bana (Troy), Sarah Snook (Succession), Jacki Weaver (Bird Box), Kodi Smit-McPhee (Let Me In), and Dominique Pinon (Alien Resurrection).This movie is brilliantly crafted on all fronts. The animation is incredibly detailed and distinct, bringing a unique visual style to the film. The storyline is compelling and thoughtful, delivering meaningful insights into mental health, self-created happiness, and the idea that your past doesn't define you. The world in which the story takes place is richly imagined, and the unexpected sexual innuendos and nudity added a layer of realism that surprised me. The theme of friendship shines here, showing how two wounded souls can help heal one another. There's so much to appreciate, and the ending strikes a perfect balance between triumph and sadness, adding a touch of realism.In conclusion, Memoirs of a Snail 🐌 is an exceptional addition to the animated genre and deserves consideration for Best Animated Picture of 2024.

1064486,No summary,"""Memoir of a Snail"" is a stop-motion animated film written and directed by Adam Elliot (""Harvie Krumpet"", ""Mary & Max""). Featuring the voices of Sarah Snook, Kodi Smit-McPhee, and Jacki Weaver, it is yet another poignant story about human loneliness and finding purpose in this complex world.In the 1970s, young Grace Pudel (voiced by Sarah Snook) lives with her twin brother Gilbert (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) and their father Percy (voiced by Dominique Pinion) in Victoria, Australia. Due to her cleft lip and unusual hobby of collecting snails, Grace is frequently bullied by the other kids at school, often necessitating Gilbert to step in and defend her. One day, Percy suddenly dies in his sleep, causing both Grace and Gilbert to be sent off to separate foster homes located several miles across the country. Grace ends up being adopted by a married couple of swingers in Canberra while Gilbert is taken in by a deeply religious family of fundamentalist Christians in Perth. Despite their geographical handicap, the twins remain in close contact by writing each other letters recounting all of their experiences living with their different adoptive families.It is a tough world out there for many of us, especially for those who fail to fit in with mainstream society, whether because of mental illnesses or just a general inability to connect with others. Speaking from personal experience, I find that having hobbies can help alleviate your loneliness but they can also contribute to a sense of alienation from those likely to dismiss your passions as weird and ridiculous. Adam Elliot, whose claymation movies tend to focus around these related themes, are an ideal representation of the desire for outcasts to be accepted for who they are, faults and all. In Elliot's latest film ""Memoir of a Snail"", we are shown another touching and sometimes darkly comical look at the lives of individuals whose longing for emotional connectivity is sure to strike a chord with its intended audience.Don't let the film's cute looking characters and clay animation fool you into thinking it is a children's movie; this is in fact an adult-oriented story that deals with the heavy-handed themes of ostracisation, depression, and a sense of belonging in this harsh and unforgiving world. As the film begins, our lead protagonist Grace sits in a graveyard narrating everything important that has happened throughout her life up until now. We see that as a child, Grace had shared quite a close bond with her twin brother Gilbert, who despite her bizarre qualities, always defended his sister against anyone who made her feel worthless. In one scene, Gilbert even breaks the finger of a bully who repeatedly harasses poor Grace for her choices in fashion, causing them to leave her alone for good.In addition to this, it is shown that Grace has a particular affinity for snails due to their ability to withdraw from the outside into their shells, something she likens herself to doing whenever she wants to hide away from her problems. Grace's obsession with snails continues well into adulthood, and the film uses many other interesting metaphors and imagery to convey this to the audience. For instance, Grace learns that snails die after laying their eggs, which is where she notes the similarities in her mother dying shortly after giving birth to her and Gilbert. Later, when their father dies, Grace and Gilbert are soon permanently separated off into different foster homes, setting things in motion for how each of their lives are going to play out from this point forward.Grace soon finds life in Canberra with her foster parents to be quite reasonable, despite their weekly habit of going to swingers parties and leaving her all alone at home to fend for herself. As she is in a city that prides itself on being the safest in all of Australia, you would assume that would put all of her concerns at ease, however, this is far from the truth. It quickly becomes clear that Grace no longer has Gilbert to defend her from any bullies or other problems she cannot handle on her own, causing her mental state to deteriorate even further than before. She struggles to make friends and is eventually so depressed she becomes a recluse with only her snails and pet guinea pigs to keep her company.Meanwhile, all the way over in Perth, Gilbert has to deal with his family of extremely religious bible-thumpers, who try to shoot down his dream of becoming a fire-breathing street performer in Paris, believing it to be a job of the Devil. Nearly all of Gilbert's attempts at free thought and expression are suppressed by his adoptive mother Ruth (voiced by Magda Szubanski), a strict woman who insists he dedicate his life to constant praying and working on her apple farm. Like his sister, Gilbert is also unable to form a connection with other people, leaving him with little other choice but to acquiesce to the high demands of his adoptive family. The only thing that keeps the two siblings going is reading the letters they manage to send to one another, where they insist they will one day reunite to scatter their father's ashes where he always wanted to be dispersed - the Luna Park Big Dipper rollercoaster.As she grows older, Grace meets and befriends Pinky (voiced by Jacki Weaver), an eccentric old lady who becomes the caring mother figure she never truly had. It is here we watch Pinky teach Grace how to appreciate the small things in life, like getting a permed-up hairdo or smoking a cigar out in the rain. Much like the snails she holds fondness for, Grace slowly but surely gains more confidence in herself thanks to Pinky's influence. In fact, she even manages to build up the courage to go on a date with a local mechanic she has feelings for, culminating in a long term relationship she has always craved.At this point, the film begins to shift its focus away from Gilbert and primarily towards Grace, where it becomes clear that the audience is supposed to absorb all of the philosophical traits of the story. In any other case, this would come across as preachy and condescending, however, I always found myself drawn towards everything Grace and Pinky were doing together, no matter how trivial. Similar to the title characters of Adam Elliot's previous feature film ""Mary & Max"", this one does a great job treating its overarching themes of loneliness and insecurity in a concise, relatable manner, using dry humour and heartfelt character growth to help us empathise with somebody like Grace. As a result, this allows viewer to come to an understanding of why people like Grace and Pinky would be able to form a connection with one another in the first place.Though his films might not be as clean cut as Aardman Animations or as large scale as Laika, there's still much to appreciate in Adam Elliot's unique stop-motion art style and sense of humour that helps set his ones apart from the others. The locations Elliot creates all have a level of grit to them, as though they actually feel lived in and reflect the era of 1970s Australia. Additionally, we also see Elliot play up the distinctly Australian quirks and eccentricities in his characters. For example, one recurring gag I loved has Pinky loudly shouting obscenities at passing motorists who either almost run her over or mock her for whatever odd activities she is currently indulging in. Also, we see Grace feeding her pet snail Sylvia some Vegemite on toast, something only an Australian would ever do within a serious context. If Aardman can be a definitive representation of British culture and Laika for American culture, then I would say that Adam Elliot's ""Clayography"" style successfully depicts Australian culture to a tee.The film's voice acting is solid thanks to the performances of the cast, primarily Sarah Snook as Grace and Kodi Smit-McPhee as Gilbert. Snook, who also narrates the film, is responsible for bringing out a great deal of loveable pathos in Grace, never once leading her down a hole of despair or self pity. You can't help but want Grace to be happy no matter what curveballs life ends up throwing her way, even if that means subjecting her to one heartbreaking moment after another. Likewise, Smit-McPhee plays up the caring brother type in Gilbert, with only his sheer determination and love for his sister preventing him from giving up entirely. These twin siblings share an almost symbiotic connection with each other, as though whenever one is hurting, so is the other.I also really liked Jacki Weaver as Pinky, Grace's first real friend who isn't a family member or an animal. Some of my favourite scenes of the whole movie involved Pinky teaching Grace her own personal tips on how to enjoy life. This is a woman who has lived through so many major historical events and interacted with all kinds of people, yet still happily finds the time to hang out with a young woman like Grace who only wants somebody to talk to. Without giving away spoilers, Pinky's significance in the story proved to be much more than I had initially expected, paving the way for a rather emotional conclusion.As the world becomes harder for us to deal with, it is comforting to watch a film like ""Memoir of a Snail"" to remind us that amongst the complexities of life, there can always be a rainbow at the end of the storms we are battling through each day. Like with ""Mary & Max"", it teaches us the importance of embracing our flaws and accepting that some things just cannot be changed about ourselves no matter how hard we may try. Regardless of that, we can all still live happy lives with our imperfections in tow, as these fundamental flaws make up what it means to be human. It is not often we get to see a film touch on such deep philosophical themes like this, let alone one made in claymation, so for that reason alone it is well worth your time.I rate it a solid 9/10.",9.0,MrDHWong,2024-10-17,19.0,4.0

The bureaucratic Head of Surgery Andrew McGrath (Simon McBurney) seems to hold her responsible somehow and tries to control her and what she can say publicly about the incident. He also suspends her and treats her almost as 'the enemy' during the coming weeks.I suspect most hospitals are run by people like Andrew McGrath and I suspect many health practitioners suffer the heavy hand of that type of bureaucracy. Despite seeming to want transparency and accountability, they seem to only want it on their own terms. It reminded me of course of the many investigations into health care in the UK where hospitals spend many years fighting in court to hide their malpractice. Malpractice that often -when the reports are finally made public- show that the hospital either knew about and tried to hide it, or engineered that malpractice through overly bureaucratic processes that did not fit with quality health care. The parents of the patient who died simply wanted to know the truth about what happened, and yet that was not easily available.Although this is just a story I suspect it is highlighting the fact that this goes on, every day, in healthcare settings.

While the premise of the movie is a decent one, the pace of this movie isn't keeping up with it. At times it feels a bit slow and boring.3)

How come that a lead surgeon/medical degree holder who isn't into cars drives a BMW E30 (a classic which would need a huge amount of effort/passion/tech to be on the road)? Why the crass language and swearing all the time by a degree-qualified doctor... profanities to show the extreme situation she is in?

However, as of my latest information (October 2023), there isn't a widely known or prominent film by this title. It's possible that you're referencing a more niche, indie film, or perhaps a recent release that's not yet been extensively covered.If this film is very recent or less publicized, there may not be a lot of detailed reviews available yet. Alternatively, you might be mixing it up with another Paris or river-themed movie (e.g., films set in or around the Seine River).That said, I would be happy to help you with a review of any specific French film set in Paris or involving the Seine River if you can provide more details or clarify the title.

1001311,No summary,"You'll never know what you're going get when comes down to a Netflix original. Sometimes, you'll get a good/great film. Sometimes, you'll get a decent/okay film. Other times, you'll get a bad/terrible film. Under Paris isn't good but it's one of the better shark films that came out recently. Outside of a few sequences, the first hour is very sluggish and takes so long to get to the shark butchering people. The characters - despite the decent performances from actors and actresses - are unmemorable, dumb, and unlikeable to the point that you're rooting for the shark. The story isn't great (please don't get me started on that climate change subplot). It has a digital look like most Netflix originals that took me out of the film and it doesn't help that the effects look cheap. However, it picks up quite a bit once the shark starts killing people in the most gruesome ways and the third act is fun because of it. Granted it doesn't entirely make up for the hour before it. But, it closes strong and the bleak ending is pretty bold (which shockingly sets up for a sequel which I wouldn't oppose to seeing). This isn't a surprise that this is a huge hit for Netflix and has a vast number of fans even if I'm not one of them.

I expected to watch an B-C movie, just to see what it's about as an casual evening flick with friends.I've postponed watching this like 3 times.The plot a shark in Paris, like c'mon, obviously a work of fiction, I need to be in blank mood to watch this I felt.And I was pleasantly surprised.I'm not gonna spoil it, so will tell only few things on why you should give this one a chance to watch.The intro action was pretty decent start.Followed by the set up in Paris location, fast paced anxiety driven french talk, made me rewind a few times on what was said as I couldn't follow lol.One character being especially annoying in wishful thinking behavior. I/we immediately wished her to be shark food. Like rooting for the shark to please eat that character & rid of the annoyance. Much like a chucky movie, with the character poking the doll and you root for chucky to do something lolAnd when the action played out, it was really gratifying.I was pleasantly surprised, entertained and laughing with the people I was watching with. It became obvious that the annoying stupidity of the characters was done on purpose for those gratifying ripping limbs moment of dealing with an abnormal shark.What surprised me & made the movie good for me,
was the Lilith myth applied. Tho an unspoken theme in the movie, the shark codenamed Lilith, and having evolved primal attributes made me reflect on the biblical suppressed lilith story, that was pretty cool.People that know lilith myth will make sense of it right away, but to others it will go unnoticed or make less sense. I had to pause the movie and explain Lilith menstruation & reproductive myth background to my fellow viewers, as they didn't get what some of us was laughing about & thought of as cool. They were missing out on that fun enjoyable detail. So I have to point that out for you to not miss out ;DIf you watch it with an fiction mindset, like
jurassic park, knowing dinosaurs are extinct,
or ""planet of the apes"" knowing talking apes don't exist,
you'll do just fine enjoying this movie, don't be silly calling them unrealistic, as some reviewers do hahaI initially wanted to give it an 6 star
My entourage watching with me, all collectively gave it an 7 star, raising eyebrows at me for saying 6 whilst enjoying the movie the way I did haha. Since we did have a really good time & fun evening I agreed on 7.To me It had an interesting ending, indicative premise of to be continued in part 2, which I'd love to see too, if they're able to make it better & expand beyond this one.This could be an Planet of the apes or chucky fictive world-like franchise, if there's a good development/production behind it, and hopefully in English next time.That's my 2 cents & review about it.

1001311,No summary,"Under Paris starts off strong, with a beautifully shot sequence set amidst a sea of waste plastic, a team of marine experts tracking a Mako named Lilith learning that if you swim with sharks, expect to get eaten. The cinematography is great and the CGI better than expected. Unfortunately, the rest of the film isn't so impressive, The plot gets bogged down in tired clichés, with idealistic environmentalists trying to save Lilith when she strays into the River Seine, and an ignorant mayor who is more interested in the Triathlon that is due to take place than the danger that such an event presents given the situation.The underwater photography in the film is excellent throughout, but the CGI gets progressively worse, as though corners were being cut to get the film finished within budget. Characters start to do really dumb things - with any excuse for them to enter the water - and the film introduces preposterous plot points willy nilly without adequate explanation (the shark's amazing evolutionary leap, how the young environmentalists can afford such high-tech equipment, where all that water came from at the end). As shark movies go, there are a lot worse (you can thank SyFy and The Asylum for those), but this one is also fairly forgettable.4.5/10, rounded down to 4 for missing the opportunity to put the word 'Fin.' at the end.",4.0,BA_Harrison,2024-10-04,0.0,0.0

It's clear that it is trying to take itself seriously, but it's such a ridiculous concept that it comes across in an absurd way. The problem is, because it doesn't know what it is, it is never able to build any tension, but it's also no fun whatsoever.Look, a lot of shark movies are doomed from the get go.

1001311,No summary,"Looking back over my reviews, I noticed a trend of only reviewing films I really disliked. To buck the trend, I'm here with Under Paris, even though I wouldn't call it a good a film.It's inevitable that Jaws gets brought up whenever a film features a shark (or even multiple sharks) because it's a classic of cinema. The downside of Jaws was it spawned a whole subgenre of (usually terrible) killer animal movies. The eighties was rife with them but - as Under Paris proves - they've never really gone away.A real cliché of this subgenre is some political figure (often a mayor) refusing to believe the heroes when told there is a threat and refusing to close (x) because of (y.) In this film, it is a mayor who is refusing to close (the river Seine) because of (a triathlon.) Under Paris slavishly follows every single Jaws rip-off cliché in a way I haven't seen for years and it is glorious.The start of this film is okay. Nothing special. Sophia (the female lead) has a shark-related tragedy that, in the long run, doesn't really matter. An irritating blue haired activist brings it to Sophia's attention there's an enormous shark swimming around in Paris and then completely ignores her advice.It's when the activists attempt to ""rescue"" the giant killer shark and cross paths with the police in a flooded area of the catacombs that this movie really hits its stride. Most importantly, it's when this movie finally reveals its real strength: it is hilarious. I'm sure it's not supposed to be hilarious. The death of blue haired activist girl was surely supposed to be tragic, but I cheered. The amount of people in the room suddenly seems to multiply many times and people run around in a blind panic, even thought they're completely safe, and then fall into the water with the big shark. A policeman falls in, and you think he'd just get out again, but no - because he's immediately about ten feet away from the edge of the water. I genuinely could not stop laughing.I would love to go into great detail about the end of the movie, because it is so hilariously stupid, but if you've got a Netflix account and some spare time, you should watch it. All restraint, common sense and logic are completely abandoned.I'd still say it's not a good film, because I'm sure I didn't enjoy it in the way it was intended, but I nevertheless did have a very good time. I watched alone, but I'd recommend getting a few friends together and having a fun time.As a horror or a thriller it definitely fails. But I now really want a sequel.(PS There's a character whose name sounds like ""enema."" His name isn't ""enema"" but I enjoyed believing it was, and now maybe you will be able to do the same.)",7.0,jamiewalton,2024-08-24,4.0,1.0
1001311,No summary,"People are being way too hard on this movie. Under Paris (or Sous La Seine, a much better title) is a lot of fun. A shark movie taking place in one of the most beautiful cities on the planet, deeply integrating the city into the story, and having some truly gnarly set pieces = a good time to me.Honestly, this movie has three of the most impressive shark set pieces I've seen in a long time. It reminded me of Piranha 3D, except without all the purposeful schlock. I genuinely think people dislike how serious the movie takes itself and can't forgive some of the admittedly stupid decisions the characters make. It's like people need to be told ""hey, this isn't all that serious!"", before they can allow themselves to enjoy something like this.But why do that? I feel a lot of French films are comfortable juggling campiness, surrealism, drama, and comedy like this. It also makes every scene of shocking violence all the more disturbing; you sort of expect, in a Hollywood movie, that certain people would be saved or that certain events would play out differently, but nah. This movie has balles.I mean, could you imagine a Hollywood movie depicting an enormous disaster right before a major sporting event the same year and month that event is happening? Or depict a current mayor - Anne Hidalgo, even if they don't name her - as basically the ""mayor from Jaws?"" No way.This movie is also really well shot; it has some genuinely gorgeous scenes and amazing moments of tension. There's a scene underneath the catacombs and literally hundreds of sharks that's just awesome.As for issues, I do think the movie could have a bit more levity and it is a tad too long. It takes a while to get going and yes, there are some amazingly stupid characters. I didn't know people's instinct is to jump INTO water with sharks in it, but apparently it's a French custom?

We have a shark expert and a police captain trying desperately to find and kill the shark, we have local authorites downplaying the danger in fear of losing money, and innocent bystanders become victims during the inevitable carnage that ensues. However, where Jaws is a masterpiece of tension, atmosphere, character building and set-pieces, this film... isn't.

1001311,No summary,"Honestly, no movie has ever defied my expectations as brilliantly as this one. The brilliance lies not in any plot twists but in how the film shifts tonally and genre-wise throughout its runtime. I won't give away any spoilers but will describe how this movie subverts tropes in three distinct parts.First, before watching «Sous la Seine», I was in a desperate state - I had nothing prepared for a movie night. Only in this kind of state can one turn to a modern shark movie. Many of these are cheap, 90% boring exposition and dialogue with lackluster CGI shark effects. For such a film to stand out, it needs an intriguing setting. I was drawn to this movie because the Seine River promised beautiful scenery, a clever story, and exciting shark encounters. Although my expectations were low, I hoped for at least a few standout moments.Initially, however, the film disappointed. It started with dull exposition and a CGI shark - just as I predicted. Things then took a turn for the worse - the characters were a group of women obsessively devoted to ecology. While environmental consciousness isn't inherently problematic, extreme obsession, such as the willingness to sacrifice the lives of police officers to save a shark, is indeed disturbing and, in the context of a character, very irritating. According to typical Hollywood conventions, the film should have followed a familiar pattern: corrupt, career-driven cops try to kill the shark while our eco-friendly heroines save the day, expose the evil police, all with a romantic subplot for lonely middle-aged women.But I was sorely mistaken. Instead, the movie delivered a masterclass in character building, showing that the writers knew exactly what they were doing. For those who have already seen the film, I hope you felt immense satisfaction. For those who haven't, it's a must-watch - you will enjoy it.",7.0,nikolajtagin,2024-08-13,0.0,0.0

1001311,No summary,"Several months - up to two years, even - prior to the Olympics of 2024 in Paris, there was quite a lot of commotion regarding the water quality of the river Seine. The officials absolutely wanted the swimming part of the triathlon discipline to take place in the Seine, but despite many efforts the water remained heavily polluted. Perhaps this is where co-writer/director Xavier Gens found his inspiration for ""Sous La Seine"". There's an even bigger danger in the river Seine here than just polluted water.Apart from the clever gimmick of a killer shark at large at one of the most touristy places in the world, and the splendid timing of release (one month before the Olympics), ""Sous La Seine"" is a disappointingly lackluster, derivative, and overly preposterous shark flick. We're supposed to believe that a female Mako shark adapted herself to freshwater and developed the ability to reproduce without a male shark. According to a bunch of arrogant Generation Z activists, this is all due to climate change and plastic in the ocean, and everybody older than 30 is responsible. Well, elderly Generation X and Y members may be polluters, but at least we are smart enough to get out of the water when there's a 23ft monstrous shark swimming towards us.Like almost every shark thriller/horror ever made, ""Sous La Seine"" also imitates the success formula of ""Jaws"". The exaggeratedly obnoxious Mayor of Paris (Anne Marivin, she's the highlight of the film) naturally doesn't believe the scientists' warnings and resolutely refuses to cancel the upcoming triathlon; - even after a bloodbath with 12 deaths in the watery tunnels of the catacombs. I wonder if she'll be re-elected... The rest of the cast is dull, the action/underwater stunts are unimpressive, and the shark attacks aren't nearly as bloody as they should.",4.0,Coventry,2024-08-11,2.0,0.0

After world cinema has explored more and enough in creature features the challenge that falls on movie makers is huge.

1001311,No summary,"I found this to be an alright killer shark movie that I watch. The story is your standard shark movie with a couple of characters trying to figure out how to stop the shark from attacking more people. It's pretty predictable throughout, and it tries to include a lot of things in it but ends up being pointless. Like how Mika tried to save the shark in order to bring it back into the ocean, but that ended up a failure. Even the plot point with the triathlon is a cliche because they barrow it from Jaws with the mayor refusing to cancel it due to obvious reasons. It seems like any time they come up with a plan, it always end up a failure most of the time. The movie does have a couple of suspenseful moments with the catacombs scene and the climax of the movie. The ending itself is something that I didn't expect and have a downer to itself. One of the biggest problems is that the characters are extremely stupid and have no logic to be found in this movie. There are only two characters who have development to them, while the rest are clueless on what they are doing, like Mika and the mayor. I found the effects to be mostly fine, but nothing too big. The sharks themselves look decent with the CGI, who doesn't look that bad and has details on her. Probably the best effect comes at the climax of the movie, which is no spoiler.

There's a whale trapped in the morass with large chunks bitten out of him. Suddenly a team of marine ecologist divers are devoured by a giant mako shark, about five times the size it should be. As the Godzilla song goes: History shows again and again, How nature points out the folly of men. Three years later one of the surviving marine biologists, Sophia, is back in Paris and it looks as if the shark, Lillith has folliwed her home. We get some dedicated river police who team up with Sophia after evidence of shark attacks appear. They are dealing with a narcissistic mayor who is more worried about the upcoming Triathlon, a harbinger of the Olympics, truly inseine. We get plenty of gore, severed limbs and people being eaten by sharks. Some great scenes as sharks get loose in the flooded catacombs. While there's a lot of hokum as well, the tension is well maintained, the sharks are mostly convincing. Good gory fun.

1001311,No summary,"Parisian river police, intrepid scientists, and annoying eco-warriors try to prevent unnecessary deaths (piscine and otherwise) when a huge, mutated mako shark migrates to the Siene River just in time for a triathlon. Don't waste your time with 'But how...?' questions, the inherent biological ridiculousness of the high-concept premise is blithely explained away with some pseudo-scientific jargon, as is the presence of some highly convenient plot-drivers buried in the mud under the city's bridges. The film opens with a greenie tinge (in a grossly exaggerated 'Great Pacific garbage patch') and tries to glue a trendy environmental message on the subsequent carnage but in the end has a pleasantly nihilistic 'red-in-tooth' view of nature as both the stupidly self-serving and the stupidly self-righteous end up as shark-chow. Although the campy ludicrousness probably contributes to its immediate appeal, with a bit more cleverness in the storyline and script, 'Under Paris' might have become a long-term 'nature-gone-bad' cult classic (like 1980's 'Alligator'). Everything about the film (acting, cinematography, special effects, etc,) suffices to move the story along to its fun but utterly nonsensical finale. All in all, an entertainingly silly entry in the surprisingly crowded world of shark-movies (i.e. 'Jaws' and 'everything else').",7.0,jamesrupert2014,2024-07-21,0.0,0.0

This idiotic tale of various shark attacks takes some of the plot from Jaws and a LOT of technical aspects of Deep Blue Sea, which seems a near masterpiece compared to this. The actress from The Artist, Bérénice Bejo, has the lead here as an expert on sharks who is recruited when a giant shark is found to be living in the Seine in Paris. The Seine is not terribly deep, so this seemed impossible, and it is, but this is a bad movie, so logic does not count and that one shark is just the tip of what is yet to come. This also happens to be the setting for that year's World Triathlon Championships and the Mayor will not listen or cancel any of the events leading, of course to tragic events. Sound familiar? I was sorta watching this for about 10 minutes before I realized that it was dubbed which always takes away from actors' performances, so no way to really assess who is good and who is not, but my guess is it's mostly the latter. I will say this though. It's one of the best dubbing jobs I've come across. That's not really a reason to watch, but then, there is really very little reason to watch this anyway.

Gens did have the good sense to ascribe to the less-is-more credo when it came to how often to show the shark and choose instead to show dark shadows in the water, a lone shark fin breaking the water surface, or a blur zipping past a diver in the water, which is much more effective than showing endless CGI shark footage (i.e. THE MEG).

What amounts to a Gallic remake of Jaws, cue the beleaguered Mayor who won't cancel the big event no matter what, as the shark starts a steady stream of attacks w/Bejo (pretty much playing the Richard Dreyfuss part) leaving Paris on its collective ear still lets the spectacle of CG shark rampage dominate the attacks leaving the viewer exhausted as well as bored & how did that happen? Don't worry folks, the film is a big hit so a sequel is on the way, mon deus!",4.0,masonfisk,2024-06-29,1.0,0.0

It's both underaddressed in the subgenre and most are unoriginal and just plain B movie trash.While most will dismiss it based on this predetermined opinions, Gens put forth a solid effort. You don't watch these films for the acting, in fact none of Gen's films are going to get the Academy scuttling around for a screener.

That's what's makes it fun. XG isn't taking himself too seriously, The shark effects are decent enough, the story is a half baked attempt to stir up s premise of an ecological system breakdown due to trash and pollution.

We all remember the mayor of Amity in Jaws.It is not a film that stands out in the visual section.

1001311,No summary,"This movie is an exercise in cinematic disappointment, straying far from the realm of realism and ultimately proving to be a complete waste of time. With so many superior films available, it's baffling that anyone would choose to endure this one.First and foremost, the portrayal of law enforcement is ludicrous. The sheer number of police officers converging on the scene is implausible to the point of comedy. It's as if the filmmakers have never observed a real-life police operation. The mayor's character only adds to the absurdity, with actions and decisions so far-fetched that they defy all logic and believability.The animation, which should be a saving grace in any film, falls miserably short. The graphics are painfully unrealistic, making it difficult to immerse oneself in the story. The animations fail to capture even the most basic elements of movement and expression, leaving characters feeling flat and lifeless.Perhaps most egregious is the depiction of the shark species. In a glaring oversight, the film suggests that sharks can reproduce without a mate. This bizarre departure from biological fact is not just scientifically inaccurate but also insults the intelligence of the audience. It's a clear sign that the filmmakers either did not care about accuracy or lacked even a rudimentary understanding of marine biology.",1.0,chesskiddos,2024-06-24,2.0,2.0

At the time of this review, Under Paris's score is 5.2-and that's about as favorable of a score as it deserves.The film opens with a tense, interesting sequence then abandons that tone and pacing altogether. Character arcs are bloated and bland. Action sequences therefore lose almost all tension because there is no reason to care about the fate of anyone who falls prey to the sharks.Everyone in this film is a 2D caricature of a person with no distinct voice. There's a lot of urgency and earnest lines about how to handle the shark problem and why it matters or doesn't; what a character's motivations and backstory are-but it's all flat. For a movie with stakes this high and this much action, it all feels fairly inconsequential between the first sequence and the last.With a tighter script, fewer characters (or at least more reason to care about them) this movie could have been a 90-minute thrill ride with fun and a surprising-yet earned-darkness to it.

His works lack soul, authenticity, and emotion. How did he end up directing a film like Hitman at age 32 when his previous films clearly signaled he wasn't the right person for the job?In his latest film, Under Paris, which is simply Jaws in Paris, the execution is terrible. Despite all the technical tools at his disposal to make it look realistic, Xavier Gens's work highlights all the issues present in mainstream French cinema today: trying to be American in French and in Paris. All the actors look like they've had their Xanax taken away and are on the verge of a panic attack. The acting is subpar, the writing is subpar, and the casting is pseudo-diverse. The protagonist is of Maghrebi descent but is handsome, articulate, muscular, and palatable even to France's far-right voters.

Directed by Antony Hickling, this 2021 French drama attempts to explore the introspective journey of a filmmaker, but falls flat due to its lackluster execution.The plot follows Richard Barlow, played by Hickling himself, who roams the streets of Paris after a personal crisis. The film promises a deep dive into themes of self-discovery and existential angst but delivers an incoherent narrative filled with tedious monologues and pretentious dialogue. The cinematography, while occasionally capturing the beauty of Paris, is overshadowed by the film's sluggish pacing and lack of direction.The acting is equally disappointing. Hickling's performance feels self-indulgent, and the supporting cast fails to bring any depth to their roles. The film's attempt at exploring LGBTQ+ themes is commendable but poorly executed, lacking the emotional impact and authenticity needed to resonate with the audience.Overall, ""Down in Paris"" is a monotonous and forgettable film that squanders its potential.

1001311,No summary,"Think of the sharks as representatives of The Earth, exacting vengeance on us for what we have done to the planet.Make sense? OK.Now the reason why you're confused is how the film handles young people. Apparently young people are the ones who are underestimating the sharks when, in real life, the opposite is the case.This is something that affects many films. See Civil War, for instance. The young journalist being 'too eager' to help the situation and crying when things go wrong. It's a product of the filmmakers' biases.

As someone who likes creature features -especially ones with sharks- I do have certain standards and expect to be terrified, but this film disappointed me with its bad acting and monotonous plot. At the beginning, I actually thought that there was a lot of potential with the main character, Sophia, because her run-in with the shark/antagonist, Lilith, was thrilling and the aftermath of her team was pretty cruel. The delivery of everything after, though, was so one-note and I felt like I was just watching, not enjoying it. The special effects, too, were adequate and, plainly, amateurish. My family and I had so many things to say during this film because there were a lot of unnecessary or strange details. I don't know if it's the bad acting, but it was a hard watch at times. Even though, the only thing this movie had going for them was the twist with Lilith and her biology/DNA, they didn't decide to expand on it at all (which was annoying since it took a while to arrive at that point in the first place). Also, it was pushing way too hard about climate change which lowered its movie value more. It kind of seems that they're preparing for a sequel, but I definitely wouldn't jump on that like I did this one. Overall, I'd rate this a 5/10 💔 because it was decent enough for me to finish, but not worth my time to watch again.

Set during the first-ever World Triathlon Championship in Paris, the film introduces a giant shark lurking in the Seine River, triggering a series of terrifying events. Young environmental activist Mika discovers the massive shark and teams up with scientist Sofia and river police commander Adil to prevent a bloody catastrophe in the city center. The movie cleverly weaves in themes of marine ecology, conservation, and political intrigue, challenging the audience's expectations for a typical shark disaster film.

1001311,No summary,"Under Paris was certainly a film. Although I don't particularly know how to describe it, but this film did have some good things, and also some not so good things. The Film also did start out interestingly, and kind of develops the story along. The main focus in this scenario is Sophia. And they have never seemed to get the effects right for a shark, apart from the Meg. Not even Jaws. So, digest the shenanigans of Under Paris with me.So, Sophia. Where does the film start? It is about her husband, and I presume they are both marine biologists, so apologies if I'm wrong, but her husband died due to a shark attack. And now 3 years later, the Shark has come back, to seek revenge. The Shark appears and should put a hold on the race, but it doesn't. The mayor is quite happy to keep it going, kind of dumb. Especially when they are now going to be attacked by a Shark.""Don't go in the Water"", proceeds to go in the water. And it was that type of film throughout, hilariously dumb decisions that made absolutely no sense. Jade as a result gets eaten by the Shark, as she tries to tough the baby shark, which is stupid in itself. So then after that, she's chomped by the shark.The scene I described about Jade getting eaten, has some intense scenes and a very deadly scenario leads to some people getting eaten by the Shark. The mother, but it doesn't end there, as the big swim is still on. I like this part of the film, it was very action-packed. And had edge of your seat action, that went faster and faster as the Shark moved along.What sets this film apart from other movies, It's dumb, yes. It's ridiculous, yes. It has, oh never mind it does A shallows and has explosions in the water, and collapses the bridge. Yes, that is all the same. However, the Shark is different, could be. And I love the commentary about the ecosystem and the pollution in the water, that's the difference. It also has interesting ideas about adaptation and weather the Shark can survive or not. But If it's near you, your body is twisting and tuning, and then we'll your eaten.The End race commences, should it? Probably not. But hear we go!, and that's when everything gets exciting, intense. And people are being eaten by the Sharks. The explosions go off, the FBI fire at will, and it ends in chaos, it was certainly and action-packed 15 Minutes. Full of scenes that were ridiculous and non-sensical, and some entertainment through this part.After all of that chaos, we then end with a flooded Paris, so now it's On Top of Paris. With Sharks all around the perimeter, now the police are stuck. And the end shows a beutiful view of Paris, and a flying bird. That ends the film In style. Now I will end my review, right after the Verdict.Would I recommend this film? Honestly, you'll be entertained, and if your a fan of Shark movies then I would, but keep away if brain dead movies aren't for you.

It's like a warm, comforting hug from a movie that assumes you've left your brain at the door-and honestly, that's probably for the best.""Under Paris"" is the latest masterpiece for those who consider binge-watching reality TV a mental workout. Set in the enchanting, cliché-ridden sewers of Paris, the film follows a ragtag group of characters who stumble upon an underground society. Think of it as a ""National Treasure"" knock-off, but without the pesky requirement of needing to follow a coherent storyline or understand basic historical facts.The protagonist, let's call him Generic Hero Guy, is a lovable idiot who somehow becomes the savior of the subterranean world. He's joined by a stereotypical love interest, whose main job is to look pretty and scream on cue, and a quirky sidekick who provides comic relief by tripping over things. If you can't keep track of these complex character dynamics, don't worry-the film makes sure to spoon-feed every detail with the subtlety of a jackhammer.The dialogue is a delightful blend of stating the obvious and explaining things no one asked about. For example, when the characters encounter a tunnel, Generic Hero Guy feels the need to declare, ""This must be a tunnel!"" Thank you, Captain Obvious. Your insights are invaluable.Visually, ""Under Paris"" is stunning if your definition of stunning is watching a two-hour screensaver. The filmmakers clearly spared no expense on special effects-mainly because they didn't spend any money on them in the first place. But hey, who needs convincing CGI when you've got the raw power of poorly lit, claustrophobic sewer sets?The soundtrack deserves a special mention for its unwavering commitment to mediocrity. It's the musical equivalent of elevator music-bland, inoffensive, and instantly forgettable. Yet, it perfectly matches the film's ambition to be utterly unremarkable.In conclusion, ""Under Paris"" is a cinematic gem for those who prefer their entertainment pre-chewed and easy to swallow. It's an ideal choice for a night in when thinking feels like too much effort. So, grab some popcorn, turn off your brain, and dive into the mindless wonder that is ""Under Paris."" After all, movies like this exist so you don't have to pretend to enjoy those highbrow films that make you feel stupid. Enjoy!",1.0,benjaminbrushfield,2024-06-15,0.0,4.0

There has only ever been one exception to the gospel rule that they're pretty much all garbage and Stevie Spielberg nabbed that particular prize half a century ago. However, they continue to be made and to entertain. Why? Because the feeling of not quite being comfortable in the water never quite leaves you.Under Paris is a fairly disappointing effort in a category that is by design a bit of a laughing stock. This is principally because it has tamed down some of the prerequisite gory shots for a vanilla rating and the whole thing seems rather tame as a result. The shark CGI is pretty decent and the performances from the human (ie supporting) cast isn't too shabby. There are moments of genuine tension amongst the peril, but ultimately this is a cocomelon version of The Meg that doesn't really add much to the genre.If you're in the mood for some trashy fun then it's worth a spin, but then there are half a dozen better options out there like 47 metres down or the reef not to mention the millennial classic, Deep Blue Sea.",4.0,conners87,2024-06-14,1.0,1.0

There's a sense of missed opportunity, a chance to explore the claustrophobic terror of a shark in a network of tunnels beneath a bustling city.Things pick up in the final act, in a frantic, over-the-top finale that feels more like a desperate plea for memorability than a natural progression of the story.Under Paris isn't a terrible film, but it's forgettable. If you're looking for a mindless monster flick with a charming Parisian setting, this might do the trick. But for those seeking something truly terrifying or innovative, this shark might leave you feeling a little fin-ished.",2.0,nERDbOX_Dave,2024-06-14,0.0,1.0
1001311,No summary,"(Yes, I did spend a while trying to come up with a pun that I hadn't seen before).As this film was gathering some traction on Twitter across the weekend, I decided that I should give it a go. Having assumed it would be an equivalent to the sort of film ""The Asylum"" make, I was surprised and interested to see that it was initially not that - though in all honesty it gets there by the end.Having lost her crew, and husband, to Shark attack, on an expedition to the Pacific garbage patch, Sophia (Berenice Bejo) returns to Paris and works in an aquarium. Three years later she's contacted by an Environmentalist Mika (Lea Leviant) who explains that she's hacked shark tracking technology and that one has made it up the Seine, as far as Paris city centre. With Sophia refusing to help them, Mika and her associate Ben (Nagisa Morimoto) undertake the dive instead, with Mika being arrested. Mika, and later Sophia, try to convince River Patrol of the unlikely interloper, but with the Paris Triathlon imminent, the mayor (Anne Marivin) refuses to consider cancelling.At the start the film is actually reasonably sensible. The shark is played as a looming threat, foreboding in the background or whipping through frame too quick to get a good look at. There's a clear environmental message, where climate change and sea pollution has changed the shark's natural habitats. Berenice Bejo, who was in ""The Artist"" is a decent lead and does have some chemistry with impossibly heroic Soldier turned River Police action man Adil, played by Nassim Lyes.I guess the trouble with the film is that, towards the end it does drift into that 'Asylum' ""Sharknado"" territory with much more explicit use of the, now painfully cheap-looking, CGI Shark. I write my reviews without spoilers usually, and I'll continue to do so here, but I just don't understand how the ending happens. I liked how spectacular it was but where does the water come from?You never know with Neflix just how well a film has actually done, but there's a chance from that ending that sequels, or sister films might be forthcoming. I'd hope they'd find a more consistent tone, either way, serious, or campy, to be satisfying. This is neither.",5.0,southdavid,2024-06-14,3.0,0.0

1001311,No summary,"Under Paris is the kind of misguided dumb shark movie that thinks it's a smart shark movie at first. It spends too much time on its admittedly well intentioned premise and goes too long between shark encounters. However, it's saved by the thoroughly serious tone combined with a third act that finally realises its full potential and just goes for broke.It wants to be one of those rare creature features where you actually care about the characters so it dedicates a lot of screen time to their struggles and past failures and yet they still feel one dimensional overall but it at least understands to give the most annoying character a memorable death. Nassim Lyes manages to make his character likeable on performance alone.Xavier Gens' direction is helped massively by the 15 rating which allows him to actually show the brutality of the shark attacks, which can create some tension in the really impressive underwater sequences.

1001311,No summary,"I am giving this movie a 9 out of 10 for the following reasons:+The movie was entertaining and had quick motion.+The shark, even though unrealistically large, fast, strong and aggressive, was a satisfying villain that contributed to the developing of many points on ecology and priorities; moral of the story, do not push limits trying to push people wrong, while risking not only yours but many other lives.+The main character, Sophia, was very likeable and had a great dynamic and partially justified plot armour. The deuteragonist, Adil, was described adequately and had significant character development.+Many tragic views of reality were highlighted throughout the movie such as the wrong execution of plans that served a good cause, political neglection and other current affairs.It is my firm belief that despite the ending being not what I expected from a shark movie, as a shark movie fanatic, it was not terrible and represented an awakening call, explaining parts about the life of Paris.Overall, I hope the franchise gets renewed and a sequel is scheduled to be released in the following years, picking up the story from where it's left and summing up everything, covering all possible plot holes.

Xavier Gens is back with his second stateside release of the year in a film that's already topped the Netflix charts, the defiantly goofy ""Under Paris,"" a movie that almost feels like it's paying homage to the master in its nods to Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"" before going full ""Sharknado"" in an insane final act that will be the reason most people remember this movie. Gens can't quite find the balance between those two films, and much of ""Under Paris"" looks as ridiculous as its plotting with over-done CGI and stylish cinematography. But this is a reasonable diversion on a summer day, a Netflix flick that gets in, gets bloody, and gets out in a way that sets up an inevitable sequel that will likely be even more preposterous than this one-in a good way.",6.0,andrewchristianjr,2024-06-12,1.0,1.0

1001311,No summary,"I've seen quite a few reviews and posts online stating this is a French ""Jaws."" I'll be blunt:
It is most certainly not, and the comparison is unfair to both this film and ""Jaws,"" on multiple levels.Frankly, there is a much, much better comparison, and while the film it most takes after certainly was made specifically to cash in on the success of ""Jaws,"" it did manage to become something of a classic in its own right (even getting a nod from Speilberg himself). It's just that, well, I'm talking about a film produced by the B-movie king himself, Roger Corman. Yes, this film is better described as a French ""Piranha."" With a little bit of ""Deep Blue Sea"" added in.The basic plot is similar, as is the threat of the creatures reaching the ocean. You even have the attempt to solve the problem with underwater explosives (though in a different way).So, with that in mind, you can expect the same B-movie fare: questionable effects, excessive carnage, government coverups, and characters acting so stupid they've literally been relegated to plot devices (or shark feed). But, if you're here for a low-budget feeding frenzy rather than high art or a truly terrifying experience, you can at least expect to be entertained.Unfortunately for this film, it does lack part of what made ""Piranha"" so good: it's played too straight whereas ""Piranha"" was refreshingly self-aware. And it also meanders for a bit, rather than having Piranha's bare-bones action-focused plot. Also, unlike Piranha, this one has an inane head-scratcher of an ending.To be fair, the acting is well above par considering the writing and production values, and this does provide something of a high point. Many of the actors aren't given much to work with, but they do a decent job with what they have. There is also plenty of carnage, even if it's mostly packed into just a handful of scenes.The writing, on the other hand, is mixed. While there's a good opening, and most of what happens between the underground encounter and the climax is solid, the middle drags with unnecessary exposition. Furthermore, most of the characters were made annoyingly dumb - an accepted B-movie feature, but grating nonetheless.And the ending cannot be panned enough. It really drags the film down. Copying the one from ""Piranha"" would have been vastly superior, but this one was so over-the-top I was nearly reduced to tears - and not from laughter.The effects ranged from adequate to only a shade above a SyFy Pictures Original. Some bits worked well, but a lot of them looked very awkward, and it could switch between both extremes almost instantaneously, which was a bit jarring. Still, this remains much better in this area than most of the other killer shark films out there, which admittedly isn't saying much.That being said, there remains plenty of carnage, particularly in the two big scenes. And a there are a few other scenes that deliver. If that's enough for you, this film will still entertain. But, while better than the vast majority of killer shark films, this is still firmly in the B-Movie category.Only somewhat recommended depending on preferences.",5.0,timberwolf3060,2024-06-12,0.0,0.0

1001311,No summary,"""Under Paris"" starts off with an intriguing premise that grabs your attention in the first few minutes. The initial scenes suggest a different approach to the typical shark movie, setting up an atmosphere that's both fresh and promising. The prologue manages to stand out from other similar films, offering a hint of novelty in the genre.However, the film quickly stumbles with some truly baffling character decisions. The characters' actions often make little sense and detract from the overall narrative. This is especially noticeable with one character, a young girl who makes a series of incredibly poor choices that are both frustrating and off-putting. Her actions not only hinder the story's progression but also severely weaken the film's character development. It becomes difficult to empathize with or care about what happens to these characters when their decisions feel so unrealistic and poorly conceived.As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that ""Under Paris"" struggles with consistency. What starts as a straightforward plot soon spirals into an over-the-top spectacle that lacks coherence. The portrayal of the mayor is particularly grating, adding to the already flawed character dynamics and further detracting from the film's credibility.The ending is perhaps the most disappointing aspect. It is highly unrealistic and far removed from any sense of believability, leaving you with a feeling of disconnection from the story's initial promise. This lack of a satisfying conclusion only amplifies the film's shortcomings.Overall, ""Under Paris"" is a film that fails to live up to its potential. While it offers a unique premise and some initial intrigue, these are overshadowed by poor character decisions, a lack of coherent development, and an unsatisfying conclusion. It's a movie I can't recommend. Unless you're a die-hard fan of shark movies and willing to overlook numerous flaws, this one is better skipped.",3.0,cygjjxtvx,2024-06-11,1.0,0.0

But the dirty waters of the Seine quickly wash away these rose-coloured ideas and there is a silly, but not too silly, basic premise, as well as, essentially, a pleasantly high body count. The spiral of how a problem becomes a super disaster is really quite entertainingly concocted. With the option of more at the end, i.e. A sequel, if it's commercially viable.

1001311,No summary,"I recently watched Under Paris and, while the story had potential, the overall experience was disappointing. The most glaring issue was the dubbing; I would have preferred subtitles over the awkward mismatch between the actors' lip movements and the dubbed voices. This distraction made it difficult to fully immerse in the narrative.Additionally, the CGI was underwhelming and often detracted from rather than enhanced the film. The acting was mediocre, with performances that failed to bring the characters to life. It's a shame because the plot had promise, but these shortcomings made it hard to appreciate the story fully.Overall, Under Paris had potential, but the subpar CGI, mediocre acting, and poor dubbing made it a less enjoyable watch.

The story intrigued me because it is new and gives new visions of the city of Paris that I didn't know, compliments to the screenwriter.

The so praised Jaws also made no sense but you don't read devastating reviews for that one. Okay this one isn't Jaws but it's an entertaining shark movie. The bloody scenes are even better than in Jaws, normal you could say as technically we are capable to make things look more real. There are a couple annoying characters, like the mayor from Paris, but that's always the case in movies like this one. The cast did a good job in my opinion, no bad acting whatsoever.

1001311,No summary,"First of all I have to say that I'm a huge fan of shark movies. Obviously they are not realistic most of the time and sharks are not these blood thirsty creatures like they are portrayed in most movies. But still I do like movies that involve animal carnage and I think sharks are great in delivering exactly that. The movie had a really interesting premise and therefore immediately stood out to most other shark horror movies. We get a short opening scene where we are introduced to the sharks and the first encounter is a pretty lame jump scare. After that something happens and I immediately knew that in order to enjoy this movie, I had to put my brain on standby. That is the case in most shark movies but some try more than others. Overall this movie had a rather serious tone and for a pretty long time almost seemed to be trying to be realistic apart from some cheesy moments. There are some pretty cliched characters and the actors did a good job portraying them. The overall production value seemed pretty solid aswell and except for some wonky CGI at times the movie had a great look. There's also some pretty decent gore involved and you definitely get some shark action.And then towards the end the movie goes completely off the rails. There's this one scene that happened which actually made me laugh out loud for it's stupidity and from that point on the movie god completely bonkers and turned really absurd. But to be completely honest I absolutely loved that. The movie went from this rather realistic approach to a shark in the Seine to this completely over the top shark carnage horror in a matter of seconds. But like I said if you put your brain on standby, you will enjoy every single second of this mayhem. Just don't look for any realism.Obviously this is not a good movie and probably won't win many significant prizes but I would definitely lie if I would say that I didn't have a great time watching this. The movie succeeds in entertaining and even brought out some laughs for its absurdity and sometimes that is all you need. [6,9/10]",7.0,aronharde,2024-06-10,3.0,3.0

Paris was getting ready to host a Triathlon with swimmers entering the Seine not knowing the River Seine was infested with sharks. The film stars Berenice Bejo, who starred in the magnificent film, ""The Artist"", as a scientist who had a horrible past losing her crew to a huge shark. The film tried too hard to be an eco friendly environmental film, showing the vast amount of debris in the ocean caused by humans, and the potential destruction of habitat for its marine life: ie sharks. The film had great potential but halfway through, it seems that you've been there before, just in a different location.At least you get to visualize the beauty of Paris in some exquisite shots, but the sharks and many of the special effects are all CGI. The acting by the main players is fine. The acting by the extras is a bit cheesy. It's worth a watch for the action and a twist to the typical shark hunts man movie!

She stars here as well delivering a mediocre performance. The same applies to all the cast; it's not bad but not great.The action scenes are decent, perhaps the film's strongest point, and the visual effects are okay.What is ridiculous though is the story. How the shark came to Paris and adapted to local conditions instantly eludes me! And this is one of the many unexplained elements of the story.

1001311,No summary,"""Under Paris"" is a captivating and visually stunning documentary that delves into the hidden world beneath the City of Light. The film takes viewers on a fascinating journey through the underground tunnels, caverns, and sewers that crisscross beneath Paris, revealing a side of the city few ever get to see.The result i conclude from this movie is that you should prefer sharks or any other animals to you. Human life is most important of all. You can't teach or make an animal understand what you mean.Director Clarence Eckerson Hill Jr. Masterfully weaves together stunning visuals, archival footage, and interviews with experts and urban explorers to create a compelling narrative that's both informative and entertaining. From the ancient quarries that date back to the Roman era to the modern-day graffiti artists who use the tunnels as their canvas, the film reveals the rich history and cultural significance of these hidden spaces.I'm amazed at how realistic all these blasts and visual effects look in the movies, even though they are fake. But it looks real.One of the standout aspects of ""Under Paris"" is its use of drone footage and 3D scanning technology to capture the vast network of underground passageways and chambers. The visuals are breathtaking, and the film's cinematography is truly stunning.But ""Under Paris"" is more than just a visually striking documentary - it's also a thought-provoking exploration of the relationship between the city's above-ground and underground spaces. The film raises important questions about the role of urban exploration, the impact of gentrification, and the tension between preservation and progress.Overall, ""Under Paris"" is a must-see for anyone interested in urban exploration, history, or culture.

The ending may have you scratching your head though.Here's a perspective that I don't think anybody is considering - I don't know the first thing about Shark Biology or marine evolution, but I looked at the 'Sharks' as a metaphor for 'Climate Change' and the plot AND the ending suddenly made so much more sense. That made me feel like the movie was actually better than people are making it out to be.Either that, or I'm just trying to convince myself that I didn't waste 2 hours watching stupid people make stupid decisions.",6.0,TreeFiddy53,2024-06-08,99.0,30.0

1001311,No summary,"Poor quality dubbed B movies have a place in the world. Stupid ideas made into a film can sometimes work, we can enjoy the silliness, the over the top plot and amateur acting and effects. So the idea on a shark or sharks in Paris can be considered good potential? Sadly not, it appears eco messages are the main part of this, as such it dampens any hope of comedy. Everyone shall meet a watery death but quite frankly you can fast forward most of it. People voluntarily swimming with sharks, nonsense and boring sharks just makes you wish you could be doing something better with your time. As humans we may have a disadvantage in water against sharks but surely this film would do better to have some comedy?

And this horror thriller is also an ecological thriller, as also was John Frankenheimer's 1982 PROPHECY. But at least Xavier Gens the director is back to France, where he began in 2007 with the terrific FRONTIERES. In the meantime, he worked for the Hollywood industry. This disaster horror thriller from France is of course daring, and proceeds the today's tendency for French film industry to produce action and horror flicks - film de genre, as we say in France - which was rather rare so far. Or exceptional. This one is good, not terrific, and, I repeat, it is funny that it is aired one month before the Olympic Games in Paris. But why not? At least the sharks don't fly, as in SHARKNADO. But the finale of this one is totally, definitely, entirely unbelievable, unrealistic at the most. And so fun, crazy and gloomy in the same time.

Now working in an aquarium, Sophia still blames herself. She is approached by Mika from SOS - an ocean conservation group, who claims they managed to track Lilith. Lost and trying to survive, the shark adapted and made its way to the freshwater Seine.With a big upcoming triathlon, time is of the essence and the Mayor insists the event will proceed, stating too much (money) is at stake, as well as her reputation. It is now up to Sophia and the River Police - lead by Adil - to take care of the shark, but Mika has other plans. The situation is aggravated when they discover Lilith is giving birth.The final act is action all the way with a good climax. The shark effects were also well done.

1001311,No summary,"Title: ""Underwhelming and Disjointed: 'Under Paris' Disappoints""""Under Paris"" promised a thrilling journey through the city's legendary catacombs, but it delivered an underwhelming and disjointed narrative that left me hoping the shark would win just to end the misery. This film, set against the intriguing backdrop of Paris's underground labyrinth, squandered its potential with poor execution and lackluster storytelling.From the outset, ""Under Paris"" struggles to find its footing. The plot revolves around a group of friends who venture into the catacombs only to encounter unforeseen dangers. While the setting is atmospheric and ripe for suspense, the story is riddled with clichés and predictable twists. The characters are one-dimensional, each fitting neatly into stereotypical roles without any real depth or development. There's the brave leader, the scared follower, the skeptic, and the token love interest - none of whom inspire any real investment from the audience.The pacing of the film is another major issue. The first half drags on with unnecessary exposition and banal dialogue that fails to build any real tension. When the supposed horror elements finally kick in, they're laughably executed. The appearance of the shark, a supposedly terrifying antagonist, comes off as more absurd than frightening. Its CGI is embarrassingly subpar, making it hard to take any scene involving the creature seriously. The filmmakers seem to have relied heavily on jump scares and gore, but even these are poorly timed and lack impact.The direction and cinematography add to the film's woes. The handheld camera work, presumably intended to create a sense of immersion, instead results in a disorienting viewing experience. Dark, shaky footage makes it difficult to follow the action, and the claustrophobic setting, while initially intriguing, quickly becomes monotonous and visually dull. The film's score, meant to heighten suspense, is forgettable and fails to complement the on-screen action.The actors do their best with the material they're given, but even their performances can't salvage this sinking ship. Their efforts are stymied by a weak script that offers little in the way of compelling dialogue or meaningful character arcs. Emotional moments fall flat, and the supposed camaraderie between the characters feels forced and unnatural.By the time the credits rolled, I found myself rooting for the shark, if only to bring a swift end to the tedium. ""Under Paris"" is a missed opportunity, failing to capitalize on its unique setting and instead delivering a forgettable and frustrating viewing experience. Save yourself the time and skip this one - there are far better ways to explore the mysteries beneath Paris.",3.0,smokemaster-81979,2024-06-07,5.0,3.0

1001311,No summary,"I recently watched the French film Under Paris (2024) on Netflix. The storyline centers around a scientist who discovers that a shark she previously worked with and released into the wild is growing at an alarming rate. Coincidentally, a major swimming event in Paris aligns with the shark's current path. She struggles to stop the shark and persuade local officials to cancel the event, but her efforts seem futile.Directed by Xavier Gens (Frontier(s)) and starring Bérénice Bejo (The Artist), Nassim Lyes (Mayhem!), Aurélia Petit (Personal Shopper), Marvin Dubart (Mortal), and Ibrahima Ba (Drift*).Despite generally enjoying Xavier Gens' work (Frontiers, Cold Skin, etc), this movie is a disaster in almost every way. The cinematography and special effects are polished, making the lack of impactful kill scenes even more disappointing. The sharks move at an unrealistic fast speed, making the action sequences awkward. The scenes of sharks jumping out of the water look particularly bad. The storyline and dialogue are cringeworthy, with the swimming sequence feeling like a poor imitation of Jaws. And who says, ""These sharks would never hurt someone""?In conclusion, Under Paris is a disappointing ""when animals attack"" movie that pales in comparison to Jaws, Lake Placid, or even Deep Blue Sea.

1001311,No summary,"Three years after losing her research team and husband to an attack by an abnormally large Mako shark named ""Lillith"" the team had been tracking at the Pacific Garbage Patch, marine biologist Sophia Asslas (Berenice Bejo) is approached by Mika (Lea Leviant) of the environmental group S. O. S. Or Save our Seas saying the group have located Lillith's tracker in the Seine with incidents such as a driver crashing into the Seine and the body not being recovered. Initially skeptical, Sophia's fears are soon confirmed as circumstances soon see her team with Adil (Nassim Lyes) of the French police's River Brigade to try to handle the situation while dealing with potentially life threatening interference from both S. O. S. As well as the publicity and money hungry Mayor of Paris (Anne Marivin) who is hosting a triathlon in the Seine.Under Paris is the latest Netflix release and comes to us via versatile genre director Xavier Gens. The movie is another entry in the well tapped well of the subgenre of Shark movies that ever since the release of Jaws have come to acknowledge that bar will never be set with some opting for character studies, some using the format as an excuse for cheapness, while others go to the extreme of over the top excess (see examples of Deep Blue Sea and The Meg films). With Under Paris or Sous la Seine we definitely have an example of over the top excess and it's the best kind of ridiculousness that I'll admit I'm a sucker for.While the movie has an environmental subtext in discussing real world issues like climate change and the Pacific Garbage Patch, that's honestly pretty secondary so this is less An Inconvenient Truth and more The Day After Tomorrow if the villain were sharks instead of global warming. From the opening slaughter at the garbage patch that cuts loose with the blood and gore in a rather refreshing fashion (even if I'll admit I could've gone for some more practical work intermixed with what we have) Under Paris delivers the intensity and excess you'd expect from a movie like this and it unapologetically dives in and goes for it. The acting from our leads of Berenice Bejo and Nassime Lyes is good and I give the actors props for treating this material as seriously as they would a procedural like Spiral. Anne Marivin serves as our secondary antagonist as a greedy mayor a la Jaws who isn't even trying to be subtle from her introduction that has her gesticulating over a scale model of Paris illustrating her big plans for the triathlon. And last but not least we have the shark itself Lillith, while the effects to bring the shark aren't top of the line (it's a modestly budgeted French film), what the producers lack in finer detail and rendering power they more than make up for with creativity and spirit. While they could've stopped with the idea of ""shark in the Seine"" and that would've been plenty to sell the movie, they go several steps beyond and the revelations about the shark not only have (sometimes literal) Earth shattering effect, but become borderline apocalyptic.I'll admit it's difficult to objectively review a movie like Under Paris because you can find no shortage of logical and scientific leaps that it takes, but it's that all too rare B-movie that could that commits to a bonkers high concept premise without feeling the need to wink at the camera and let the audience know it's in on the joke. It has scares that work, the action's exhilarating, and it's just fun. Sometimes all you need is fun escapist nonsense and you'll find that here I assure you.",7.0,IonicBreezeMachine,2024-06-07,21.0,22.0
1001311,No summary,"This little pulp genre product brings with it a extra French panache and good production values, being out of the Netflix stables, released just in time and appropriately for the Olympics - taking place partly in and around the great River Seine. The underwater work, open swimming, location shots and GCI is weaved together pretty well. The film's pacing sets off a little slowly but reaches increasingly blood splattered levels of mayhem, after first introducing a backstory for the main protagonist. Sophia is a traumatized marine biologist who lost her spouse and crew to our mutant shark some time ago. Berenice Bejo does well to possess the same kind of haunted ambivalent attachment to our fishy friends Roy Scneider famously did in the original Jaws movie franchise. All the actors bar none are sexy and stylish of course. There's plenty for genre fans here of interest: monstrous genetic aberrations, a chilling autopsy scene, the standard disaster movie survival rules i.e. The foolhardy, hippies, people of color, plebs & all minor characters' chances aren't too good, but also surprising justice in that the days of the 'nicest' may also be numbered. Also there are insane city officials bent on vainglory putting the public at risk. Stopping the show is the last thing they want considering the prestige & preparation money involved. I imagine this will go down well in the Paris 2024 olympic village this month... even the (real) cosmetic riverside cleanup and expensive special measures to prevent E.coli contamination gets a few mentions - just when you think it's safe to go back in the water! The environmental messaging is bearable, and I guess as relevant to the context as a sharks are with Paris. I believe the absurd title and mad overall premise both have some kind of nobility and true horror heritage in them, like the classic 'Sharknado' (2013) and its sequels (with sky-bourne sharks attacking aircraft.) So it's highly formulaic, minus a twist, but still a sufficiently entertaining watery slasher.

1001311,No summary,"Right, well when I saw that trailer for this 2024 Netflix movie titled ""Sous la Seine"" (aka ""Under Paris""), I must admit that I was really looking forward to watching it, as there is just something entertaining about shark movies.And now that I have watched it, I will say that it was an entertaining movie, no doubt about that. But at the same time, it just didn't fully live up to my expectations. There simply were a tad too many things throughout the narrative that just didn't make any sense.Sure, ""Sous la Seine"" is a watchable and entertaining movie if you enjoy shark movies, and I do that, of course I do.The storyline in the movie was pretty straightforward and very easy to get submerged into. However, it wasn't exactly Shakespearian theater that unfolded on the screen. Not that I was expecting that, but it would have been nice with a storyline that had a bit more meat on it, so to speak. Writers Yannick Dahan, Maud Heywang, Xavier Gens, Yaël Langmann and Olivier Torres put together a fair enough storyline, provided you enjoy popcorn movies where you just lean back, munch of the snacks and doesn't have to use your brain while watching.Something that I did really like about ""Sous la Seine"" was the fact that the audience are thrown into the feeding frenzy very early on in the movie. I liked that about the movie, because director Xavier Gens wasn't squandering a lot of time to establish characters or setting the stage. You just dive right on into the bloody waters.I wasn't familiar with a single actor or actress on the cast list. The acting performances were good, and that definitely counted for something.Visually then ""Sous la Seine"" was good. The effects were nice, and the CGI animated sharks looked realistic.Without spoiling anything here, I have to say that I personally found the ending of the movie to be rushed and sort of amateurishly written. Sure, it paves the way for a sequel, but it was just a laughable way to the end the movie in my opinion.Was I entertained throughout the course of the 101 minutes that ""Sous la Seine"" ran for? Sure. Will I return to watch it again? No. It is certainly a good shark movie, but it just doesn't have the bite required to become a genre classic.If you enjoy shark movies, then you should by all means sit down and watch the movie.My rating of director Xavier Gens's 2024 movie ""Sous la Seine"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",6.0,paul_haakonsen,2024-06-06,7.0,10.0

This film is full of typical shark film clichés; stupid characters, ignorant person in power and strange looking CGI. It had some intriguing elements that stacked this film above the rest of shark films, like The Shallows or The Meg. This film feels a little bit more than a simple rehashing of a survival story. The two main characters have to battle a large, complex shark against the backdrop of Paris. No spoilers, but I would definitely recommend that you watch the entire film until the end for the ultimate conclusion. The characters here are forgettable and, once again, most of them fall easily into the stereotypical roles that people in shark films have to in order for the body count to be higher.Overall, this film was much better than I anticipated it to be, with the middle dragging out until the tension finally starts to ramp up.",6.0,greyKbarclay,2024-06-06,51.0,26.0

Fondly named Lilith, the shark wrecks havoc, killing most of Sophia's crew. 3 years later, Sophia is yet to move on completely from the incident and the losses she faced, an youth activist approaches her to inform Lilith is now back in Seine. The transition from saltwater to freshwater shark baffles her and soon Sophia's realizes the threat. As they try to convince the police who are dismissive, the mayor however is hell bent on kickstarting the triathlon, afterall it's one shark to contain. With the stage set up, what does Lilith bring to the show forms rest of the story.For one, I definitely enjoyed this film and I will admit that after a long time, here comes a good shark film. There is no sugar coating till the actual story begin as director Xavier Gens means business. As we are introduced to the giant Lilith, we are clear what's in store. There is an acceptable explanation to why this particular shark could transform itself into surviving in freshwater and no time is wasted in creating any drama or sci-fi mumbo jumbos. The CGI is off at many instances but that didn't put me off.Once Sophia reaches out to the police then it's all Lilith's mayhem and it was totally worth it. The encounter with the ill informed activists was definitely the highlight. However, the set up for the Piranha-esque climax with the triathlon and shark on the loose, I was bit disappointed with lesser gore and though repetitive, I still wanted to see that in full glory. They did replace it with even more crazy stuff and the CGI was actually passable here. I may not be too keen for the sequel if it were to be made but I was all the more satisfied with Under Paris.

1001311,No summary,"Let's start with the pacing. For the first hour and a half, almost nothing of significance happens. The characters wander aimlessly through the catacombs of Paris, delivering uninspired dialogue and making increasingly poor decisions. The film's pacing is excruciatingly slow, with scenes dragging on far longer than necessary. It's clear the filmmakers were trying to build tension, but instead, they just built frustration.The concept of ""Under Paris"" had potential. The idea of an ancient evil lurking beneath one of the world's most iconic cities is intriguing. Unfortunately, the execution was completely botched.The characters in ""Under Paris"" are another major problem. They are remarkably stupid, making a series of bafflingly bad decisions that defy logic and common sense. It's hard to root for characters who seem determined to get themselves killed. Their lack of depth and development makes it impossible to care about their fates, which, given the genre, is a fatal flaw.The film's climax, which should have been its saving grace, is another letdown. After almost 90 minutes of tedium, the action finally picks up in the last 15 minutes. However, the deaths are mediocre at best, lacking the creativity and shock value that good horror demands. The only interesting part of the movie is the ending, which feels rushed and tacked on. This segment should have occurred in the middle of the film, providing a much-needed jolt to the narrative and allowing for a more engaging second half.In conclusion, ""Under Paris"" is a mess of a horror film. It squanders its promising concept with poor execution, a glacial pace, and characters that are impossible to care about. The only redeeming feature is the final 15 minutes, but by then, it's too little, too late. This movie is a prime example of what I hate about the horror genre-wasted potential and an utter lack of thrills. If you're looking for a good scare, look elsewhere.

Until the climax, the movie alternates between wasting time and shark action that's been seen in dozens of movies before. Additionally, all of the characters in this film are either unlikeable or undeveloped. I would have been perfectly fine with every single character in this film becoming shark food. The special effects also leave a lot to be desired, I believe Deep Blue Sea in the 1990s had better special effects than this film a quarter of a century later. However, the climax of the film bumps this film up a couple stars. Under Paris has possibly the wildest ending in a shark movie that doesn't involve sharknados.

1001311,No summary,"When it comes to shark movies, there's a lot of misses and only a handful of hits. Jaws, obviously, is the gold standard by which every single movie is measured, and so far, arguably, none has dethroned the king at the top of the mountain.This one definitely won't either.With that out of the way, let's focus on the good, bad and ugly...Let's start with the bad... If only people in survival movies weren't that stupid, may be they'd live... And it's always the same. Of course, if they were smart, the movie'd be much more boring because people would seldom die and nobody wants that in a shark movie. But some of these people wouldn't have made it past puberty with that level of stupidity in their gene pool.The CGI could be better, but I've seen way worse in movies 3 times the budget this one probably got. There's situations, shots & angles in there clearly ""borrowed"" from other shark movies, such as Jaws of course, but also Deep Blue Sea and The Shallows, but they usually work so they get a pass from me.The characters are pretty one dimensional, and performance is a crapshoot going from pretty good from Berenice Bejo to acceptable from the male lead, to forgettable ( to be nice ) from secondary characters, to really stiff and bad from extras and really small part actors, so that gives a very unbalanced feel from the movie in that department.The ugly... it's a snooze fest for at least half of the movie, and tension is pretty low except for a couple of moments. 20 minutes in and I thought about switching the TV off, but it became slightly more exciting for a minute and I decided to give it a shot and watch the whole thing. It gets better for about 30 minutes, then a little dull again, then exciting again for the last 30 minutes. But these are 30 intense minutes and that's obviously the movie's climax and ending.The good... when the movie delivers, it really does deliver. Some great shots, really intense action, some gore, and I think the ending is really really cool and unexpected. Living in Paris, that ending gave me goosebumps and it's quite original as its reference in the movie realm is really different from any other shark movie and is both open and works as a closed chapter too if they decide not to give this a sequel. Bejo is a great actress, and makes the part work. The movie looks good, and if you're a shark movie afficionado, it's one to watch and enjoy, while keeping in mind that any shark scientist will be screaming at their TV because scientifically nothing holds up, but that's not why we watch these now, is it ?",6.0,ChrisMartins1973,2024-06-05,4.0,6.0
1001311,No summary,"Well, let's get something out of the way. No other shark movie will ever top Jaws. Even Jaws remake didn't top Jaws. With that out of the way, where does Under Paris figure in the pantheon of the many other shark movies that followed Jaws?Considering that we've been fed with a truck load of crappy shark movies since the days of Jaws, I approached Under Paris with trepidation. Was it gonna be a Jaws 4, Meg, Sharkanado, 47 meters down?Well, I'm happy to report that, Under Paris is closer in terms of rank with The Shallows, probably THE shark movie that comes closest to Jaws in terms of entertainment value.Sure, it's premise of climate change causing sharks to move to the freshwaters of the river Seine in Paris might be a tad preposterous, but once you get that out the way, what Under Paris strives to give you is pure entertainment delight that is topped with generous suspense, decent acting, shark menace and the resultant bloodfest, brilliant camerawork. The pace hardly slows down, and there's enough in most of the scenes to hold your interest. That is, even when the irritating environmentalists show up to lament about how people mistreat ocean life and do their SJW act, you find yourself still willing to put up with it, because you know there's a greater action waiting to be revealed beneath the surface (pardon the pun). And for once, moviedom lets SJWs reap the consequence of their juvenile POV, in this case, the silly attempt to treat a man-eater ala a cuddly house poodle. I went ""Yippee"".And boy, when the action scenes arrive, does they bowl you over or what? No moment is wasted with silly shark vs people battles, ala Meg. Instead, what team Xavier Gens proceeds to give us is innovative shark frenzy in the underwater catacombs of the Seine. Improbable perhaps, but it's all executed brilliantly, so much so you don't spend time thinking about its sensibility.In a summer that already has its fill of movies that are below their hype (eg Furiosa), give this one a chance.

There are a few scenes in the last third that spoil the overall impression somewhat, but that's not tragic. If there were to be a sequel now, and it almost looks like there will be, I wouldn't be sad. Please also bear in mind that this is a French film and that viewing habits are different.

Not much good to it actually. There are no good dialogues, no good character development and you don't really feel any attachment whatsoever to any of the characters so you don't care what happens to them.

Munjya is no different and works along these tropes until the final act. Another thing that is bothering me with these movies is the runtime which is just way too long. Why can't they make them 80-90 minutes. This would make the whole story more compact and interesting for the audience. One thing that I enjoyed about this movie is the entity with a rather unnerving look and fast movements.

So being a fan of that franchise I went for this movie. After watching it I can say it's definitely made for kids, mature audience will feel like just one time watch.Story is pretty basic and simple. The Acting performance of newcomer Abhay Verma was good among all, his mother's acting was also pretty good alongwith his friend Spielberg and Kattappa. But the main issue is with Sarvari's performance and that filthy looking CGI Munjya's character. Sarvari just added some glamour in this movie and her role was good for nothing. Munjya's CGI effects looked very cheap and his constantly chirping about girls makes audiences annoying. Audience will get annoy with that character rather than find it horror or sympathy for him. Cinematography is pretty beautiful with it's exotic locations. Songs were Ok Ok type and Screenplay was gripping I'll say.Overall a good family based time pass movie.

1187058,No summary,"Munjya (2024), directed by Aditya Sarpotdar, is an ambitious attempt to blend horror and comedy, but it falls short in some key areas. The story revolves around a ghost trapped in a tree, setting the stage for what could have been an engaging supernatural adventure. While the premise is intriguing, the film doesn't fully capitalize on it.The movie's strength lies in its second half, where the narrative picks up and delivers some well-executed humor and suspense. The interactions between the characters, particularly the comedic timing, bring lightheartedness to an otherwise supernatural plot. The performances of Sharvari Wagh and Abhay Verma add charm, but the direction and screenplay sometimes falter, with the pacing feeling uneven. The suspense reveal in the first half weakens the tension and makes the climax a bit too predictable.Cinematically, Munjya has some visually appealing moments, especially in the supernatural scenes, but it lacks the polish seen in its predecessors like Stree or Roohi. The CGI is functional but doesn't stand out, and at times, the film feels like it's geared more toward a younger audience than a broad demographic.Despite these flaws, Munjya is still an enjoyable watch for those who enjoy light horror-comedies. It's not groundbreaking, but it's fun in its own right, and families can find it a decent, entertaining film to watch together.

Everyone's been calling it a sleeper hit; with Stree 2 being a massive hit and this being a part of the 'MSU', I'd been eager to watch this one for a while.Abhay Verma, Sharvari and the supporting cast were great in the film. I don't know who decided to bring Satyaraj in, but interesting choice.The film is a horror comedy and could have easily ended up being a Stree (2) (which might end up being criticism held against the film- that wasn't as funny as Stree) but I'm glad it wasn't. The audience would have said ""It's just like Stree but with a different ghost, what's the point....!?""; damned if you do, damned if you don't. But I am in the 'Glad it wasn't like Stree' camp.Glad Bittu's character was portrayed the way it was (anything more would spoil it) vs what I expected. Spielberg tries to do what the Stree trio does and while he obviously isn't and can't be the trio, he does well enough to add to the comedy.Shoutout to the VFX team - you could tell it was graphics but it was done well!Couldn't help but appreciate how some cultural practices in the Konkan region are very similar to other parts of the country.The film isn't anything mindblowing, you're likely going to find Stree (2) to be more entertaining and provide more value for your time/money but this isn't a bad movie at all.

1187058,No summary,"After all the praise that this movie received and the money that it made, I was highly optimistic about enjoying another horror-comedy after Amar Kaushik's 'Bhediya', but to my disappointment it was all just a sham. 'Munjya' is nothing more than a poorly made film with some terrible acting performances and to add insult to injury this movie is now part of the ""Stree Horror Universe"", so we will have to tolerate 'Munjya' in the 'Stree' and 'Bhediya' sequels as well ! It boggles my mind wondering how such scripts get approved.WHAT'S BAD :1. Munjya starts off decently giving us the background story of Gotya but then turns into a rather dull story with an extremely irritating villain who keeps repeating the same dialogue a thousand times throughout the film. The movie is not engaging at all and you will be forced to check the time on a number of occasions because of how boring the proceedings are. I wonder why this film calls itself a horror-comedy because there wasn't a single scene that made me laugh and not one that had me on the edge of my seat.Movies based on folklore are always welcome, they easily grab my attention because they talk about a world very different than ours, a world where magic was still alive, but this story had no depth at all. What kind of villain did we have here ? A perverted kid who couldn't think beyond marriage, that's all. What's so special about this story ?We all love to support the underdogs, but it's difficult to watch a hero who's scared of everything and can't even deliver a line properly. Throughout the film I kept waiting for Bittu to emerge out of his shell and scare the wits out of 'Munjya' because it just wasn't enjoyable to watch his character at all.2. The romantic track between Abhay Verma, who plays Bittu, and Sharvari, who plays Bela, has been written in the most unimaginative way possible. The conversations between Bittu and Bela will make you suffer from a cringe attack and you would wish to erase them entirely from your memory. Also, Abhay Verma looks too young to be Sharvari's romantic partner, in fact every time both of them shared the screen, he looked like her younger brother. Bhagyashree Limaye, who plays Rukku, looked way better as a co-star of Abhay Verma. The scenes which had Rukku and Bittu were actually much more pleasing to watch; perhaps they should have been the romantic pair of the film.3. It's frustrating to see a film that uses stupidity of characters to push through it's story. A mystery or thriller should always surprise its viewers, try new things and test their intelligence, not their patience. This movie uses the same old tropes that have been used a thousand times before by all the horror films made in the past and I just don't understand how anyone would still be intrigued by watching all this nonsense.4. The acting performances of the lead pair, Abhay Verma and Sharvari, left no impact on me at all. The writing was a letdown no doubt, but the lead pair just didn't have the screen presence to hold my attention. This film will make you realize the value that Shraddha Kapoor, Kriti Sanon, Rajkummar Rao, Varun Dhawan and Abhishek Banerjee bring to a film.5. The music of the film is extremely forgettable. Even Sachin-Jigar couldn't inspire themselves to create anything magical for this film. Every single song in this film was completely unnecessary, even the one that came after the film came to an end. Filmmakers should always keep the theme of the film in mind before creating a song; the end credits song, 'Taras' felt like a song from a completely different film.WHAT'S GOOD :1. The acting performances of some of the senior actors and actresses is pretty good. Suhas Joshi as Ajii and Mona Singh as Pammi were wonderful in their respective roles and lent believability to the world created by the writers.2. Exploring folklore is a refreshing change from the kind of stories being told through movies and for that the creators must be applauded, but they need to come up with a stronger screenplay.3. The special effects were quite good in the film considering the budget with which it was made. The main villain, Munjya, was created entirely through vfx and that is truly commendable.To conclude, in my honest opinion, watching 'Munjya' would be a complete waste of time. It's a half-baked product that is neither funny nor scary. I would strongly urge the producer of the film to not include this in the horror universe of 'Stree' and 'Bhediya'.",2.0,Perspicuity1,2024-08-30,0.0,1.0
1187058,No summary,"Watching a horror film is supposed to be an exhilarating experience, a mix of suspense, fear, and adrenaline that leaves you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately, this film seems to have fallen woefully short of those expectations. With a script that could generously be described as ""very bad,"" the movie struggled to engage the audience from the very beginning. The lackluster writing not only made the plot feel disjointed but also left the characters underdeveloped and unrelatable.One of the most crucial elements of any successful horror film is a compelling story that draws the viewer in, making them care about what happens next. However, in this case, the script was not just bad-it was excruciatingly dull. The dialogues were flat, lacking any sense of urgency or emotion, which made it difficult for the audience to connect with the characters or the narrative. Instead of creating tension and suspense, the script meandered aimlessly, leading to a series of predictable and uninspired scenes.The pacing of the film was also problematic. Horror films typically build up tension slowly, leading to a climactic moment that shocks and terrifies the audience. However, this movie seemed to misunderstand this fundamental principle of horror. The pacing was erratic, with scenes that dragged on for far too long without any payoff. Instead of keeping viewers on the edge of their seats, the film felt more like a chore to sit through, with each passing minute becoming more tedious than the last.Moreover, the acting did nothing to salvage the poor script. The performances were extremely lackluster, with actors delivering their lines in a manner that was both wooden and devoid of any real emotion. In horror films, the actors' ability to convey fear, desperation, and terror is essential to creating an atmosphere that resonates with the audience. Unfortunately, the cast in this film seemed entirely incapable of doing so. Their performances were so flat that it was difficult to care about their characters' fates, and as a result, any attempts at building tension or suspense fell completely flat.The lack of horror was perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the film. A horror movie should, at the very least, be scary or unsettling. This film, however, was neither. The so-called ""scary"" moments were predictable and unimaginative, relying on tired clichés and jump scares that anyone could see coming from a mile away. There was no sense of dread or unease, no moments that made you want to cover your eyes or look away. Instead, the film felt more like a poorly executed drama with a few half-hearted attempts at horror thrown in for good measure.It's frustrating when a film that promises to be a terrifying experience turns out to be anything but. The complete lack of genuine horror elements in this movie was baffling. It was almost as if the filmmakers had no real understanding of what makes a horror film truly frightening. Instead of creating an atmosphere of tension and fear, the movie was filled with cheap scares that did nothing to unsettle or disturb the viewer. The result was a film that was more likely to induce eye-rolls and groans than screams of terror.As the film dragged on, the boredom began to set in. What should have been a thrilling ride turned into a tedious slog, with each scene blending into the next without any real sense of progression or escalation. By the time the credits finally rolled, it was difficult not to feel a sense of relief that the ordeal was over. However, that relief was quickly overshadowed by the throbbing headache that had been steadily building throughout the film, a result of the sheer frustration and disappointment that came from watching such a poorly executed movie.In conclusion, this film was a major letdown on all fronts. With a bad script, extremely boring execution, poor acting, and hardly any horror to speak of, it failed to deliver on any of the promises that make a horror movie worth watching. Instead of being scared, the only thing viewers are likely to feel is a sense of regret for having wasted their time on such a forgettable and uninspired piece of cinema.",1.0,prashanthc-41405,2024-08-30,2.0,1.0

1187058,No summary,"""Munjya"" begins with an intriguing storyline and has a promising start, setting the stage for a horror-comedy experience. However, as the movie progresses, it struggles to maintain a balance between its horror and comedic elements. The narrative loses its grip, and neither the horror nor the comedy fully delivers. While there are a few jump scares, they lack the intensity to classify the film as genuinely scary.On the positive side, the CGI used to depict ""Munjya"" is commendable and adds a visual appeal to the movie. One of the standout moments is Sharvari's dance sequence towards the end, which is worth watching and perhaps the highlight of the film. Also, make sure not to miss the post-credit scene!Overall, ""Munjya"" is a mixed bag. If you enjoy horror-comedies, you might find some entertainment here, but don't go in expecting too much from either genre.

I feel Bollywood should make efforts into making such folklores instead of the usual dated stories. The story of Munjya, the little demon and the hunt for his lust using our newcomer Abhay Verma is the basic premise of this film.I have to first appreciate the VFX. With such a low budget in hand, they came up with a character like Munjya that looks straight out of a Hollywood Disney production . There are some shots with sparkling lights even that looks beautiful. I think more than the plot , this little demon and his rendition have attracted audience. Hindi audience desperately needed something new and Munjya helps to fulfill their needs.Coming to other aspects, the performances by Abhay Verma is commendable despite this being his first film. The fun yet horrifying sequences between Abhay, his punjabi friend and Munjya bring in the maximum laughs. But being a horror-comedy, the horror falters again. There are barely any sequences that will make you spook. The lady who played Abhay's grandmother has an important character arc in the film and whenever she comes on screen, its an emotional moment for all. The film also moves at a good pace with no stumble blocks so you dont get bored anywhere (except for a song in the 2nd half that pops out of nowhere).The climax was pretty interesting as well with the final showdown lasting for a good 15 minsThere is a post credit scene proves Munjya is a part of the horror comedy universe of Maddock but its integration is terrible. I would have loved it had they integrated the cameo in the climax rather, as a saviour when Abhay was getting thrashed by Munjya.Overall, a fun decent entertainer thats better than a few previous Maddock films.",8.0,Biswas_,2024-07-07,0.0,4.0

The prime example being Roohi . Fortunately for the makers & us , the audience this film is a treat to watch.The cinematography is excellent in creating an eerie ambience important for the infusion of some tension building moments !! A special mention to the VFX team who have done a fabulous job in ensuring that the digitally created Munjya blends in seamlessly with the real characters without looking fake and out of place !!A strong script with well etched out characters, along with a moments of genuine horror mixed with a heady dose of humor at the right time will keep audiences engaged all throughout!! Meticulous attention has been paid to the visual aesthetics and BGM which creates a positive impact on the end product.The balance of horror and comedy has been absolutely spot on ! Very few films have been able to achieve this. Kudos to the director and makers for their efforts!!The lead pair Abhay Verma & Sharwari Wagh deliver stellar performances .

Munjya Movie
Story: When a young man visiting his ancestral village unwittingly unleashes a vengeful spirit, Munjya, he must save himself and his love interest from its clutches. This tryst with the childlike creature throws him into a hilarious and terrifying adventure.Review: Director Aditya Sarpotdar's horror comedy, inspired by Indian folklore, takes the viewer on an atmospheric adventure early on. The story unfolds in 1952 in the idyllic Konkan countryside, where young Gotya resorts to black magic to win an older girl Munni's heart. However, he tragically loses his life as his attempt backfires. Since he dies within 10 days of his 'munj' (thread ceremony), he becomes a restless spirit, Munjya, trapped in a tree.Fast-forward to the present, Munja latches on to his descendant, Bittu fixated on fulfilling his unfulfilled desire-to marry Munni and set his spirit free. However, in a turn of events, Munja sets his sights on Bittu's love interest, Bela Sharvari. A ride filled with laughter and horror follows as Bittu scrambles to save himself and Bela from Munjya'sclutches. As the film's story progresses, the comedy often dilutes the tension the horror elements build. The energy slips in the second half as the narrative prioritises goofy scenes such as spirits swapping, a self-proclaimed godman S Sathyaraj helping the protagonist, and so on.",10.0,mashmathi,2024-06-19,1.0,3.0

1187058,No summary,"""Munjya"" is a delightful blend of horror and comedy that manages to keep its audience both on the edge of their seats and in fits of laughter. The film starts with a quintessential haunted scenario: eerie noises, dark settings, and spine-chilling suspense. It almost perfectly sets up a classic horror movie atmosphere that grips the viewer with its intensity.As the story progresses, however, ""Munjya"" deftly shifts gears. What begins as a spine-chilling narrative slowly unravels into more of a mediocre haunted comedy, especially after revealing the CGI of Munjya. The initial horror setup, which showed high potential, gradually gives way to comedic elements that dominate the latter half of the film.While the transition from horror to comedy is seamless for some, it might disappoint viewers who were invested in the high-stakes terror of the first act. The film's shift in tone, especially marked by the less-than-impressive CGI of the titular Munjya, feels like a letdown. The creature that once seemed menacing becomes a source of slapstick humor, diluting the initial impact of the horror.The performances are commendable, with the cast showcasing impressive versatility. Their reactions to the absurdity of their situation feel genuine, and the comedic moments are well-timed. However, the screenplay's pivot to humor may not sit well with everyone, particularly those who were expecting a more consistent horror narrative.Technically, ""Munjya"" shines in its early stages with excellent cinematography and sound design that amplify the horror experience. The eerie visuals and creepy sound effects are executed with precision. However, as the film shifts to comedy, the visual gags and timing, while handled competently, might not be enough to satisfy the initial promise of a horror story.In conclusion, ""Munjya"" is a unique cinematic experience that blends horror and comedy. It starts strong with a high-potential horror story but gradually turns into a comedy. This shift might delight some but could be disappointing for those who hoped for a sustained horror experience. It's a rollercoaster ride that begins with scares but ends with laughs, making it a mixed bag depending on your genre preference.",6.0,toofanbaruahofficial,2024-06-16,2.0,1.0

The plot is a chaotic mess, making it impossible to follow or feel any suspense. Instead of building tension, it only builds frustration and confusion.The characters are poorly developed and utterly unrelatable. Their motivations are as mysterious as the supposed horror elements of the film. It's hard to be scared when you can't bring yourself to care about the people on screen.The acting is abysmal. The performances are so wooden and unnatural that it feels like watching a high school play gone horribly wrong. The dialogue is cringe-worthy, filled with clichés and lines delivered with zero conviction.The pacing is another major issue. The movie drags interminably in some places, while rushing through important plot points in others. There's no sense of timing or rhythm, making it a tedious slog from start to finish.Technically, the film is a disaster. The cinematography is bland and amateurish, with nothing visually appealing or innovative. The special effects, what little there are, are laughably bad and completely ineffective at creating any sense of fear.In the end, ""Munjya"" fails on every level.

I especially liked the Munjya lore and I am stoked for the upcoming sequels as well as Samantha and Ayushmann's Vampires of Vijaynagar. I am also loving the use of different regional folklores and bringing them to the masses through these films. I need to rewatch Stree now. Vfx and cgi are good enough for its small budget although the Munjya character could have looked better. Bhediya cameo is ok I guess. Making cameos in each other's movies does not make it a universe. Looking forward to actual crossovers in the future. Sharvari and Abhay Verma did a good job. While the hallelujah bit was funny, I don't understand Sathyaraj's character declaring that he doesn't convert. I call bul.lshit on that. All those sick hallelujah programs of fake miracles, instant healing, crazy people jumping and shaking in India are definitely run by missionaries to convert the locals. Sharvari is fire in the Taras song.PS.

1187058,No summary,"The universe of Stree - Bhediya is expanding with this new movie on the block. Horror comedy is a tough genre, but if done right, it can be one of the most entertaining to watch, and this film tries its best to justify the genre.The story follows a shy boy whose family harbors a dark secret involving the spirit Munjya, which gets revealed when he visits his native village. Now, he needs to save his loved ones from Munjya, as the spirit has tagged along with him.The story is innovative and keeps you engaged. It takes all cinematic liberties, which is fine for such movies, but the lack of character development cannot be overlooked. The comedy in this universe has always been very organic to the narrative, but here it feels highly forced in many places.Abhay Verma, in the leading role, is the heart and soul of the movie. His innocent charm and balanced expressions are sure to win your heart. He is a good find and is here to stay. Sharvari Wagh has hardly anything to perform, and even in her limited screen time, she goes overboard. Her character is highly underdeveloped. Also, the chemistry between the leads is zero. Mona Singh, as the loud mother, is decent. The fun and comedy brought by Sathyaraj are the best parts of the movie. Every scene featuring him is a laughing riot, proving his acting chops yet again. Suhas Joshi as the grandmother is endearing and does well.The graphics and CGI work to create Munjya are amazing. The technical crew has done a commendable job with it. If the story had more depth, it could have worked wonders. The editing is shabby, to say the least, as the scenes jump from one to another haphazardly. The BGM has worked in its favor, maintaining the horror feel. The jump scares placed here and there are nice but do not genuinely scare, which is a letdown.This universe has had amazing songs in other movies, but it was a big disappointment here.

1187058,No summary,"**Review of ""Munjya"" (600 Words)**""Munjya"" promises a blend of comedy and horror but unfortunately fails to deliver on both fronts. The film revolves around a protagonist who remains disappointingly stagnant throughout, a ""loser"" who never evolves beyond his initial characterization. This fundamental flaw sets the tone for a narrative that feels underdeveloped and poorly executed.The story's premise hints at potential-a cursed tree that the protagonist visits whenever he's in distress, seemingly to get beaten up by some supernatural force. This recurring motif could have been an intriguing narrative device. Instead, it becomes a baffling and tedious element that adds little to the plot. Each visit to the tree lacks the dramatic or comedic impact that the filmmakers presumably intended, turning what could have been a source of suspense or humor into a repetitive and nonsensical gimmick.The script is one of the film's weakest aspects. Rather than exploring the protagonist's struggles in a meaningful way, it opts for a series of poorly constructed scenes that fail to engage or amuse. The protagonist's frequent crying and subsequent retreats to the cursed tree feel like a lazy plot device rather than a character-driven choice. There's a sense of aimlessness in his actions, and the lack of character development leaves the audience with little to root for.Comedy, which should have been a strength of the film, falls flat due to weak writing and ineffective delivery. The characters seem to try too hard to be funny, but their efforts come across as forced and awkward. The punchlines miss their mark, and the timing-so crucial for comedic effect-is consistently off. There is an evident struggle to balance the comedic and supernatural elements, but the execution feels amateurish, and the humor never quite lands.Moreover, the supporting characters, who are presumably meant to add comedic relief, come across as one-dimensional and foolish. Their interactions are often absurd without being amusing, and their contributions to the plot are negligible at best. This lack of engaging side characters further highlights the script's inadequacies. Their attempts at humor feel more like desperate ploys to elicit laughter, but they instead highlight the film's inability to deliver genuine comedic moments.The film's pacing exacerbates these issues, dragging through scenes that contribute little to the overall narrative. The story moves without direction, leading to a conclusion that is as unsatisfying as the journey itself. The climax fails to provide any resolution or growth for the protagonist, who remains disappointingly unchanged. This static characterization undermines any emotional investment the audience might have had, leaving them frustrated by the lack of character progression.Despite its potential, ""Munjya"" suffers from a fundamental disconnect between concept and execution. The idea of a cursed tree and a protagonist facing supernatural consequences for his woes could have been the foundation for a compelling narrative. Instead, it is squandered by lackluster writing and a protagonist who never rises above his initial, unimpressive state. This failure to capitalize on the story's inherent possibilities is the film's greatest disappointment.In summary, ""Munjya"" is a missed opportunity. Its promising premise is let down by a poorly constructed script, ineffective comedy, and a protagonist who remains a ""loser"" till the end. The film's inability to deliver on its comedic and supernatural potential results in a narrative that feels disjointed and uninspired. ""Munjya"" could have been an engaging blend of humor and horror, but it falls short, leaving audiences with little more than frustration and unfulfilled expectations. The movie's attempt to blend genres results in a muddled experience, making ""Munjya"" a forgettable entry in the realm of horror-comedies.",2.0,gauravmail-66221,2024-06-09,8.0,4.0

Stree was one of the finest from Bollywood in horror comedy genre. Munjya lives up to the expectations too. Following a similar theme like stree, maddok films once again delivered for stree universe fans, they will definitely love it. Munjya is definitely 80% as good as stree with a little known starcast in lead roles.Songs :: Highlight is again Sachin Jigar Music after Bhediya. 'Tenu Khabar Nahi' is one of the finest , even film contains many version of these soulful song , even a non-arijit sad version along with the original score.Presentation :: Acting wise Mona Singh, Sharvari Wagh and our own Katappa(Sathyaraj) was excellent. Rest of the cast is okayishhh with little scope for their art . Munjya(CGI) himself is sometime a little irritating and it may be because of poor supporting acting skill by protagonist Mr. Abhay Verma, needs real improvement to sustain in bollywood .

1187058,No summary,"Munjya, the latest entrant in the horror-comedy universe, offers a blend of spooky thrills and light-hearted moments, though it falls short of the standards set by ""Stree"" and ""Bhediya."" But, it still manages to be a marginally better watch than ""Roohi."" Munjya is not the perfect horror comedy, but it brings something new to the table. A blend of horror and comedy is well supported by some effective CGI work that brings the ghostly elements to life.Directed by Aditya Sarpotdar, who is known for his impressive work in Marathi cinema, ""Munjya"" stands out with its unique script and engaging narrative. The film's story, while intriguing, is somewhat let down by its uneven execution. The first half has a few loose ends that might leave audiences scratching their heads, but the second half picks up the pace, delivering a captivating experience. Saurabh Goswami's cinematography successfully creates a spooky atmosphere that complements the film's tone. The background music score and VFX are other highlights.The cast of Munjya delivers commendable performances, despite the film's weaker star power compared to its genre counterparts. Abhay Verma shines as Bittu, convincingly portraying the character's fear. Sharvari impresses with her acting too. Sathyaraj, as the quirky godman, delivers an amusing performance, and Taranjot Singh provides many laughs as well. Mona Singh, though given limited screen time, is effortlessly impactful in her scenes. One of the film's highlights is its end-credit scene, following the Taras song. Do not miss it!Direction 3/5

1187058,No summary,"Munjya (2024) :
Movie Review -The fourth film in Dinesh Vijan's so-called ""horror universe"" is here, only to make us believe more proudly that there is nothing called the horror universe; they are just trying to cash in on Stree's goodwill. Actually, I'd like to forget that there were any horror universe movies after Stree (2018) and would love to directly see ""Stree 2"" as the second film if they really care about the ""standard."" Roohi didn't even fit in the universe zone; Bhediya was a shocking low for Amar Kaushik after Stree and Bala; and now, Munjya shows another low for the horror universe. What is a horror comedy, by the way? For today's audience, it's about mediocrities like Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2; for a certain group, it's Stree; for a little more mature group, it's Bhool Bhulaiyaa (2007)-if they couldn't really understand that pathbreaking impact of Manichitrathazhu; for higher-level movie buffs, it's Ghostbusters; and then comes the highest gallantry group of movie geniuses who love Gene Wilder's Frankenstein spoof or Abbott and Costello's horror spoofs or early breakthroughs like ""The Ghostbusters"" (1940) and ""The Cat and The Canary"" (1939) or the grandfather of all, James Whale's cult, ""The Old Dark House"" (1932). Those who acknowledged and ate all those films at weekend dinners can see how low Munjya is as a horror comedy. Today, horror is comedy. That's a statement to keep in mind. Horror and comedy are two different things and should be kept like that. If I try to shake them together, you are sure to spoil the juice. Munjya does that while trying to be overly funny and overly aggressive at the same time.According to folklore in Maharashtra's Konkan coast, Munjya (the Bramharakshas) is believed to be the ghost of unmarried boys who died within 15 days of the ""Mujya"" ceremony, inhabiting peepal trees. Munjyas are described as restless bachelor ghosts who roam trees at night, possessing cleverness and multilingual abilities. Our protagonist, Bittu (Abhay Verma), is living in Pune but is haunted by bad dreams of a tree and a Munjya that's bound to it. He loves Bela (Sharvari) but never dared to tell her, making the path clear for Bela's foreigner friend. During his recent visit to his native place and, by mistake, to the Chetukwadi (a place where Munjya resides), he frees Munjya from the tree. This Munjya happens to be one of his ancestors, who wanted to marry Munni but died before that. Now, he wants to marry Munni, and Bittu is forced to help him. His search for Munni ends with Bela, who happens to be Munni's blood relative. So now Bittu must save Bela from Munjya by finding a way to kill the Brahmarakshas.Munjya's script is scattered into pieces, and it's damn boring and predictable for today's audience. If Munjya was such a powerful ghost, then how can you show humans even trying to fight him like it was a college fight and having conversation as if he were their buddy? I can imagine a 15-year-old boy being too aggressive about marrying a girl and doing all that black magic stuff, but how can someone ask me to believe it's all done by a 10- or 12-year-old boy? Muniya's basic variant looked too underage to pull off the entire idea of the film. I couldn't figure out how Bittu found that beating stick after all in the climax. Wasn't it supposed to be lost with his dead grandmother? Firstly, he was a big-time fattu, and Munhya was a big-time goon, so the face-off wasn't really convincing. We all know that stuff about finding courage, finding our own strength, and all that. Many filmmakers have done that over a hundred times, including Sarpotdar himself in his own Faster Fene (2017) and Mauli (2018). Ok, so which mom goes on a trip with his son and his friends without any reason and at that place where she never wanted to come back? Those kiddish play games by Munjya at Bittu's house were so annoying. They just killed all the chances of me fearing evil. I was rather taking it as a spoof of Munjya and the terrible voiceover and characterization they have done here. Never for a moment, I thought that Munjya was going to scare me. Not even once.Speaking of performances, Sharvari did look promising with Bunty aur Babli 2 and The Forgotten Army, but here, she seemed to be going down. Bela's character was poorly written, and moreover, there was nothing for Sharvari to add to it. It was just like she came on sets, shot her scenes as the writer wrote them and the director directed them, went home, and slept well. No extra efforts, because there was no place for that. Abhay Verma didn't look like a protagonist at all. He was more like a scapegoat who can't do anything, yet he remains alive till the end. You know, Munjya could have killed him within 2 seconds. Character-wise, it was full, but acting-wise, it was pretty okay. Suhas Joshi still holds enough fire, and Mona Singh couldn't find her fire. Sathyaraj is made into a cartoon here, and it's highly disrespectful to his stature. I was kind of expecting a lot of Marathi actors since the film was set in Konkan and it was being directed by Aditya Sarpotdar. I was happy to see so many Marathi faces, but sadly, they all went overacting. Overall, I can say that Munjya has to be the weakest and least known casting unit in the horror universe.The music here is terribly disappointing. I still remember those hit songs from Stree. Roohi destroyed my childhood memories of Shamur, and Bhediya went away with a pretty good album. Compared to the previous films, Munjya has the weakest music album in the horror universe. The cinematography captured some beautiful shots of the Konkan coast and that remote island of Chetukwadi. Pune is easy to catch on camera, and it looked too intentional most of the time. Munjya's background score is painfully loud. A horror film can't go wrong with its BGM, but Munjya did. That's just not done. You can't F with this department-not even by mistake. The art design and production were partially fine, and the VFX was a mix of ugliness and gorgeousness. Sarpotdar's sasta Gollum is too poor to be considered a demon in a horror flick. But what to do when you have folklore telling you so? Still, I think the visual effects could have been much better and fancier. Munjya falls flat on both story and storytelling. Had these things been better, I wouldn't have minded much about the screenplay, background score, and acting. Lastly, I only want to ask one question to the makers: Bhai, taras nahin aaya audience pe? I hope, Stree 2 gives a new life to the dead horror universe now.RATING - 4/10*",4.0,SAMTHEBESTEST,2024-06-07,15.0,16.0

1019404,No summary,"Spanish director Guillem Morales delivers an intense thriller that pleasantly surprises with its interpretive strength. It is one of those rare feature films that exudes its theatrical origin from the beginning, but remains absolutely cinematic in every sense.As we enter into the story proposed by screenwriter Morgan Lloyd Malcolm, who adapts her own play, obtaining a film that constantly surprises you with the force with which it explores past traumas and desperation so that as spectators we fall into a game of mental duels that bring out the best in its two performers. Both main characters feel trapped like the eloquent metaphors with which their director gives us clues in its powerful beginning.Both Naomi Harris and Natalie Dormer enter into a duel of characters with intense monologues and all the expressive talent of two great actresses who absolutely take over the film and make you have great moments of resentment, sorrow and madness. All stimulated by the talent of the Spanish director who manages to make his debut in English with all the intelligence and wisdom of a director who knows how to handle suspense with absolute greatness. If we take into account his previous works, it is a sure bet for the film to be as efficient as it is, and to have a great director behind it.The Spanish director's direction takes us on a journey full of tension and suspense, with the particularity of having some wild and attractive twists, with a disturbing and dramatic piece that contains a lot in its 96 minutes and that remains in the memory beyond its final credits.A surprising and distressing ending with a masterful handling of atmosphere, tension and details make this a great film that is worth giving your time to and enjoying as one of those little gems that always come to surprise us with satisfaction.",7.0,saolivaresm,2024-10-10,6.0,3.0

1019404,No summary,"Guillem Morales' The Wasp is the most disturbing, disquieting horror/thriller this year and a strong contender for like.. ever. It's also just a sensationally well written/acted dramatic story with two emotionally flammable performances from Natalie Dormer and Naomie Harris, the latter giving what must be a career defining turn. I can't speak about plot much at all except to say that these two actresses play women who were once vaguely associated with each other when they were girls at school, and now reconnect in some form as adults, both now leading very different lives. The film shines an uncompromising beam of illumination on secrets from the past and deep hurt that people carry with them like a literal shard embedded in their self identity, and explores the often brutal and explosive behavioural ways in which that sort of residual pain lashes out when spurred on by karma decades later. It's a shocking, refreshingly unpredictable, often revolting experience that leaves one with a haunted, bitter shadow on the soul but it's also a brilliant, essential and very thought provoking story that takes on its characters and themes with utmost maturity. Harris has made a name for herself in prolific franchise stuff like 28 Days Later, Bond and Pirates Of The Caribbean, giving excellent and starkly varied performances in each. Here she is a terrifying, showstopping wonder and nails the roiling inner instability of her character's adolescent trauma bubbling forth through a calm, collected adult-life veneer. Dormer I've only seen in Game Of Thrones where her character is the exact opposite of the steely, unpleasant bi**h we see onscreen here, also a terrific portrayal.

1019404,No summary,"I didn't expect much seeing the ridiculous IMDB rating but noticing some intelligent praise about this film from others. All of us who saw it really enjoyed it.A woman is in the middle of an abusive relationship and feels trapped. She turns to her childhood friend whom she hasn't seen in many years, with whom she shared a jarring experience but admired her friend's seeming innate bravery and ability to do what this trapped woman could not. And that act is to get rid of her miserable, abusive husband. But there is a much deeper meaning to the wasps in this movie, which take on literal, comparable, metaphoric roles in this film in a very clever way.The acting is seriously top notch as this film is all about whether the main characters can pull off their performances and boy do they ever. These two women are absolutely riveting. I saw a comment about a child actor who plays a very small role and it was actually perfectly played as a clueless neighbor and a funny scene at that.What probably drove this film's rating downward is that it doesn't have an ending that would make many 'happy' and what they'd want to see. But it's quite clear from all that occurs that it's definitely the right one. It may not have the huge punch that some were expecting - but that's likely because they were looking in the completely wrong place. What would drive someone to their limits? That's what this film is about and I'm guessing some may relate personally.This is a rare gem and is easily a major cut above average.

It works well, it keeps you offguard, and the time passes very quickly indeed. These sorts of films were all the rage in the 1940s, a time when the industry was still transitioning from the static feel of a stage play (few backgrounds, lots of dialog) to the more kinetic medium of film. The only unusual thing about it is the fact that some big-name critics went nuts for the project, saying it was the best thing they had ever seen. Not really. But it does hold the attention.

1019404,No summary,"The Wasp comes from a long line of multi-layer thrillers that have a better-than-average chance I think of becoming cult classics.These influences from the likes of The Usual Suspects to Knives Out are worn prominently on The Wasp's sleeve, but this is certainly not a bad thing. The script is pretty tight, and the revealing of the layers to the story are surprising to say the least. At a tidy hour and half, the film never overstays its welcome, and makes for a generally enjoyable film. Dormer has a good performance throughout, she even had me convinced that she was some other actress for a while. The set designs were nice, certainly a lot of detail and thought went into the few settings the film takes place in.However, somehow this film doesn't really live up to the greatness that it hopes to achieve. In the end, the ending did not bring as much energy as it should have, perhaps because this film wanted to be a little cleaner than it needed to be. Despite the darkness and grittiness alluded to, somehow I think more could have been done. Another huge black mark is that The Wasp falls prey to the oldest rookie mistake in the book: child actors. I probably don't need to say any more than that the child actors in the film are really bad. Finally, and perhaps the most damning thing against the film, is the ever present feeling I got that Naomi Harris was overacting very hard for the film. I don't want to put the whole thing on her though because certainly some blame can be put on the writers for her dialogue, but for a film (and genre) that typically relies on a superstar lead to carry the show, I regret to say that Harris was unable to give me a convincing performance.Despite all this, the film is still enjoyable due to its tidy script and short runtime. Not a bad film, but no need to run to the theatres to watch it.",6.0,tylerkom,2024-09-06,27.0,11.0

1241674,No summary,"A group of college friends reunite for a Caribbean scuba diving adventure, exploring a sunken WWII battleship. However, they become trapped in the rusted underwater maze, with great white sharks at every turn.Joachim Heden delivers a watchable shark tale, but don't expect the likes of The Shallows, 47 Meters Down, The Reef, Open Water, or even Shark Bait, to name a few.Andrew Prendergast and Nick Saltrese's script is talky for the first half hour, with the usual setup tropes: friends having a good time, water-shark-kill. It's drawn out, but Heden offers some tense moments in the third act, where the digital sharks look on form. The CGI is a mixed bag, at times very convincing. While not as well executed, the underwater settings are at times reminiscent of Mako (2021) and Deep Fear (2023).There's a lot of reflection with the characters, and the melancholiness matches the odd whimsical soundtrack. Actress Kim Spearman is notable and does a great job with what she's given. Jack Parr has screen presence and is likable and memorable. The film is dedicated to the late Julian Sands, and it's a pity this is one of his posthumous films. Still, in his brief role, he acts the chops off it.Overall, it's better than The Requin (2022) and countless other low-budget shark films out there.",,amesmonde,2024-11-22,0.0,0.0

Initially, ""Noah"" (Jack Parr) isn't keen on taking them all, but when he discovers that his local bar-owning mate ""Levi"" (Julian Sands) is $36k in the hole, he teases the the cash from the arrogant ass that is ""Brett"" (Alexander Arnold) and so down they go. Initially, all goes well enough but you have to remember that a battleship is a large construction with loads of corridors, ladders, portholes and especially with this one - rust. As this entitled and hungover bunch of travellers enter deeper into the infrastructure, they also meet a problem a little more menacing. Sharks like it down there too, and they are hungry for some rubbery frat sandwiches. What with a maze of collapsing ironworks, the odd dead body and now these marauding man/woman eating fish, we are set for quite an underwater adventure full of squealing and screaming with acting and dialogue that had me wanting to sign up for my local adopt-an-elasmobranch society. The photography works quite well and it does generate a little tension, but the rest of it just hammy comic book stuff where the cast deserve all the chewing they get. The sparingly featured Julian Sands must have fancied a free holiday somewhere warm, else he had a tax bill to settle - otherwise this is entirely forgettable fayre that we've all seen before and won't need to see again.

1241674,No summary,"When i can't sleep at night i sometimes look for a underwater or shark movie, the atmosphere watching them in the dark just makes me feel so cozy. Its hard to find decent ones now because not a lot are made due to production.They are so heavily criticized without taking into aspect the fact that it is all filmed under water, scuba equipment for everyone, Film crew and all. Knowing this i give most of these movies a break.I experienced a tragedy and had severe insomnia... finding this hidden movie was a god send.Something about the atmosphere of this movie the claustrophobia is just genius and should of been the main focus with the shark as a minor antagonist.Everything about it tho surpassed expectations. Due to the low rating i wasn't expecting much, surpassed my every expectation... most movies of this standard flop towards the end, and this ones last 15 minutes were not terrible so again thats another win. And Julian's send off at the end i feel was a reach out to someone special. (The actor passed before the films end and cost the production to halt to a stop)Someone already said it. ""Its not jaws, but it should bei the sequel to it""...my only issue with the movie is the last few deaths seemed rushed, and i would of made the oxygen more of a problem, not saying it wasn't but at one point the sharks take over all the action making the lack of oxygen take a backseat.The sharks were good, looked good and the dismemberments were excellent practical effects, sharks were cgi but hidden in shadows and not much screen time to keep viewer in belief(tho the cgi isnt bad at times its just not the same as practical effects)
Infact the gore elements( the practical effects) where amazing, i kept wondering how they did certain things underwater without making it look goofy.I will watch this movie agian one day, years from now with few friends and cold beer on a rainy day. And again in years with my kids late at night cuddled up on the couch.I must say, not a oscar winner, but definitely one of the better shark movies to come out in the last few years And earning a place on my shelf.Ignore the low rating, or infact embrace it knowing its a shark movie...and then be pleasantly suprised when you realize it isn't some B movie the rating suggests.Id give it a higher rating but it had the potential to be so much better.

1241674,No summary,"This is a movie that caught my attention when looking at the schedule of what was showing at the Gateway Film Center, like I do regularly. The title seemed intriguing and then learning that this was Julian Sands' final role piqued my interest me. It being a shark film and considered horror was enough to figure out a time that worked to see this. I also saw that a buddy on social media liked this as well.Synopsis: a group of old college friends reunite on a Caribbean scuba diving trip exploring the wreckage of a WWII battleship and find themselves trapped inside the underwater labyrinth of rusted metal surrounded by great white sharks.This starts during World War II. We are in a submarine, which fires a torpedo, sinking a battleship. The ship we are seeing is the USS Charlotte. There are two survivors floating on wood when one is attacked by something underneath the water. Neither survive.We then jump to the present. Levi (Sands) owns a boat and has a business where they take people out to do dives. Everything he has is outdated though as money is tight. He also can no longer go underwater, due to his health. He has one employee, Noah (Jack Parr). We get an interesting scene early on where a boat that more advanced equipment goes by. These two are looking for the USS Charlotte. Noah goes under and thinks he's found it. There were recent tropical storms that shifted the sand under the water and cleared enough away.Back on the shore, Noah's friends have come to visit. It has been a couple of years and we see that now, being adults, they're drifting apart. There is Brett (Alexander Arnold) who works on Wall Street. He's rich, but it never seems to be enough. He likes to show off as well. His sister is Sam (Kim Spearman). She and Noah used to date, but they broke up because she wants to be a doctor in New York and he is working where he is. The attraction is still there. There is also Riley (Erin Mullen) and Logan (Arlo Carter), who also join them.While they're catching up, Logan notices the slight smile that Noah has. He assumes he has found a girlfriend down here. Noah instead reveals what they found. Brett jumps on the chance to do something special and dive down to see it. He's even willing to pay, driving the price higher as Levi declines the offer. It isn't until Noah learns how much they're in debt and that Levi has leveraged the boat to keep afloat, that a deal is struck. This group of young people is going to dive into the USS Charlotte. Everyone is certified. The issue there is that Brett pushes the envelope and there are unforeseen issues once they're inside the ship.That is where I'll leave my recap and introduction to the characters. Where I'll start is that I did a bit of brief research about the ship they're using here, the USS Charlotte. I'm not finding that this one was lost during WWII. It's not a big deal. They're creating something that I know is real. There are ships that have been lost and there are people like this out there trying to find out where they could be under the ocean. The idea also reminded me of Jaws with the story that Quint tells of the USS Indianapolis. Since both are shark movies, I wouldn't be shocked to learn that was the inspiration for the backstory we see to start this one off.Where I want to start is that the set up for this movie worked for me. The only issue that I can foresee here is borrowing elements from other movies to create this one like I said. That doesn't ruin this. It is hard though to give it credit though since it loses originality. You could say that the opening set up is taken from Jaws. It then feels like 47 Meters Down where our characters get trapped inside of this sunken ship with limited oxygen. It even feels like that other movie's sequel with different things that happen. It is a shark movie though, so it must work in its confines as well.Now that I have that out of the way, let me delve more into what we're getting here. Let me start with our duo Noah and Levi. There is charm in the fact that they don't have the technology that other companies have. I don't know if that is necessarily by design, but more of necessity. Levi is broke. He took out money against his boat and when he can't pay that, this business is done. This is a common idea that we see. It also helps to build up how much of a jerk Brett is. He flaunts his money and uses it to control people.Then going from there, I thought that the setting up of getting our group trapped in the sunken ship is good. Brett doesn't want to pay the amount that he is for a normal dive. This sets up the fact that finding this wreck was important. If this group gets to explore it first, that is something that others don't get the chance to say. They don't even necessarily care outside of that. Then to complicate more, Noah keeps reminding his friends to be safe. When the sharks attack, it is when they're trying to leave. They've wasted oxygen, which adds tension. There are things done to prolong what we're seeing, but this is the biggest thing. It also fits the title.Let me then discuss the creature feature aspect, which are sharks. They are done with CGI. Not really any other way that you could do this. It would be too expensive and most likely would look fake. This doesn't lean too much into the sharks though. It is more about the fight against getting out of the water before running out of air. Having these animals stalking them helps to push this though, since panic sets in and causes people to use more air. I do think this works well in conjunction with building the tension for the movie. My only issue here is that the sharks don't always act normally. There is blood in the water, which they can smell for miles away, yet they don't come after characters. It feels like it is done this way for convenience.All that is left then is going over the acting. It is sad that this was Sands' last film. He was solid here though and always a professional actor. Not sure I've seen him do a bad role, even when he's been in things that aren't great. Spearman is attractive. There is a backstory with her and Noah that doesn't add a lot, but their chemistry is there. Parr works as our other lead character. Arnold is solid as the catalyst to getting this group stuck under the water. Mullen, and Carter rounded out the friend group. They bring enough personality to the characters which makes them feel real. No one is great, but they work for what was needed.In conclusion, this is a fine shark film. It takes elements that work with other films and then blends them with what we get here. The set up works and is believable. The acting brings the characters to life and I had no issues there. This is done well enough with the cinematography leading the way and the sound design as well as the music building tension. The sharks are CGI, but not sure what else you can do there. I do fear that this is going to fall into obscurity due to not doing enough to stand out. It is still a solid one to check out if you like shark films.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Reviews_of_the_Dead,2024-08-12,2.0,5.0

Noah's visiting friends persuade them to dive on the wreck before it's handed over to authorities. Their dream dive quickly turns into a nightmare as they become trapped inside the underwater wreck. As their oxygen runs low, massive sharks appear. The remaining time is spent on escaping from both the wreck and the sharks.The CGI-generated sharks are smartly kept mostly in the darkened shadowy waters inside the submerged war boat, which generates admittedly derivative but suspenseful moments and a scary claustrophobic atmosphere. One must, however, suspend disbelief at the unrealistic tactical intelligence displayed by these sharks. The final escape-to-the-surface sequence is as disappointing and nonsensical as it is surprising, but much of the film works well up to that point. The young actors, especially Kim Spearman, ably display wide-eyed terror while being chased below decks, under director Joachim Heden's steady direction.Some critics have drawn parallels between this film and JAWS, but other than perpetuating myths about shark intelligence, the two movies are quite dissimilar.",7.0,jfrentzen-942-204211,2024-07-28,4.0,6.0
1241674,No summary,"When I stumbled upon this 2024 movie, I didn't know what I was in for. All I knew was that it was a new shark-themed movie that I hadn't seen, and thus I opted to sit down and watch it. Yeah, I do have a thing for shark movies, despite the vast majority of them being questionable affairs.And imagine my surprise when I saw that this movie has Julian Sands on the cast list. He has always been one of my favorite actors, and it was quite a nice surprise to get to sit down and watch this last movie that he starred in. And knowing that he will not be making more movies, sort of made it a bit of an emotional affair to see him on the screen.Writers Andrew Prendergast and Nick Saltrese put together an enjoyable and entertaining storyline. It was a pretty straightforward storyline, so you can essentially just lean back and watch the action on the screen whilst munching on some snacks. I like the concept of the storyline, which takes your average generic shark-themed storyline and adds a twist to it. I have to say that I was genuinely entertained throughout the course of the movie.The acting performances in the movie were good. The only performer that I was familiar with on the cast list was Julian Sands. It should be noted, though, that they had a good ensemble of actors and actresses for the roles, and they performed well.Visually then the movie was good. It wasn't the type of shark movie that make usage of stock footage of sharks swimming around, and that spoke well in favor of the movie. The sharks looks real and moves realistic, adding a lot to the overall enjoyment of the movie.If you enjoy shark movies, like I do, then ""The Last Breath"" is definitely well-worth sitting down and watching. I was genuinely entertained throughout the course of the 96 minutes that the movie ran for, and it is a movie that I warmly recommend you to sit down and watch.My rating of director Joachim Hedén's 2024 movie ""The Last Breath"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",6.0,paul_haakonsen,2024-07-28,12.0,7.0

1241674,No summary,"Every summer, as sure as there will be lazy days at the beach, there will undoubtedly be a shark movie. This year sees a couple, including The Last Breath. Every shark movie since 1975 owes a bucket of chum to Jaws. Whether intentional or not, every movie where a dorsal breaks the surface pays homage to the original fish tale. Jaws is sublime, and its effectiveness lies more in the interest of characterization than waiting for a mechanical monster to pop up. The flaw in most shark films post-Jaws is uninteresting characters and the emphasis on cheap thrills. The Last Breath rides this flaccid wave. The film merely treads water enough to remind audiences that they could instead watch Jaws.Full Review at Geek Vibes Nation.",4.0,philwmovies,2024-07-24,19.0,15.0

1135245,No summary,"Right, well while I had never actually heard about the 2024 movie ""Spiders on a Plane"" prior to stumbling upon it by random chance, of course I opted to watch the movie. Why? Well, I've always found monstrous spider movies to be interesting, And let's just face it, if ""Spiders on a Plane"" was anywhere near as interesting as the 2006 movie ""Snakes on a Plane"", then it would be worth sitting down to watch.The storyline in the movie was pretty straightforward, to the point where it was basically non-existing. Writer Ben Daly put together a script and storyline so simplistic that it was bordering on the fact that there was actually no storyline. But then again, you don't sit down to watch a movie titled ""Spiders on a Plane"" in the hopes of stumbling upon the next great Shakespearian masterpiece. Watchable, sure, but you're not in for anything extraordinary or grand here.There are a lot of things in the narrative that made little or no sense. But then again, you wouldn't really expect a movie such as ""Spiders on a Plane"" to be a perfect cinematic experience.Truth be told, I actually dozed off three or four times during the 65 minutes that the movie ran. And even while drifting off for a short while and returning to the movie, I didn't miss anything. So yeah, it was not really a grand script that carried the movie.While the movie certainly wasn't crammed with A-listers in terms of actors and actresses, there were still a couple of familiar faces on the screen. I've seen enough questionable low budget movies to actually be familiar with Danielle Scott and Jase Rivers. Despite the fact that the movie was mostly unfamiliar talents, I will say that the acting performances were actually fair, taking into consideration that there was practically no script for them to work with,.With ""Spiders on a Plane"" being a creature feature with spiders, of course the movie-makers would resort of CGI for bringing the spiders to life on the screen. And with it being a monstrous spider movie, having proper CGI that looks good, realistic and brings the CGI animated spiders to life in a way that the audience would actually buy into the premise, would be a crucial thing for the movie. Did it have that? No! Not even remotely. I have to say that ""Spiders on a Plane"" had some of the worst CGI animated spider's I've seen in movies, and I've seen more than my fair share of questionable monstrous spider movies.I would not suggest you to rush out and waste 65 minutes on watching director Ben J. Williams's 2024 movie. Some of us sat through this sluggish movie, so you don't have to; you're quite welcome.My rating of ""Spiders on a Plane"" lands on a generous three out of ten stars.",3.0,paul_haakonsen,2024-11-21,0.0,0.0

1355076,No summary,"The Lost Holiday, offers an emotionally rich and deeply nuanced story that explores themes of family, love, grief, and reconciliation. The film is centered on Cassandra Marshall, played by the legendary Vivica A. Fox, who learns of her estranged son Damien Holliday's (Jabari Redd) death and travels to Los Angeles to handle his arrangements. However, Cassandra is shocked to discover that her son's husband, Jason Holliday (portrayed by Smollett), has already taken care of everything. Cassandra not only grapples with her son's death but also the revelation that he was gay and had a life - including a husband and a foster daughter - she knew nothing about.Vivica A. Fox commands the screen as Cassandra, a character that blends fabulousness with moments of being a bit over-the-top. Her performance is both spunky and heartfelt. Fox's impeccable comedic timing brings levity to the heavier aspects of the story. She masterfully conveys a mother grappling with the shock of discovering her son's hidden life, all while grieving and undergoing her own journey of personal growth. This subplot of Cassandra's evolution injects a sense of hope into the film, serving as a reminder that life, even in the wake of grief, continues.Smollett's direction shines, particularly in his ability to tell a story that authentically captures the experiences of Black LGBTQ+ individuals. The relationship between Jason and Damien is portrayed with respect and depth, avoiding stereotypical narratives, and instead focuses on love, care, and partnership.Overall, The Lost Holiday is a solid, heartwarming, and often humorous film with a stellar cast and a script that skillfully weaves humor with heavy emotional moments. Smollett's performance as Jason is a standout, as is Fox's award-worthy portrayal of Cassandra. This film is not only about family and love, but also about coming to terms with the past and finding healing in unexpected places.",10.0,production-96-415322,2024-10-02,3.0,30.0

870360,No summary,"I write this review from Italy, where the movie was released on November 7th.I was pretty curious to check it out for all the various reasons many others had already expressed.And once I ended watching it all I could think was ... Finally They Made It!Finally they realized a REAL movie in which these characters can show all of their crazy traits in the more genuine way.The result is a great balance between this more Classic aura (in more senses than you could think) and the more Modern setting.First of All, the thing I'm sure everyone will agree on: it was so satisfying seeing 2D being used again in a large production, and in a so fluid way that perfectly serves the characters' expressiveness and dynamism, and all of the settings' dimensions.And speaking of characters, I appreciated the idea of centering it about Porky and Daffy, they're simply the best duo of the Tunes' lot, even though I have to admit I do prefer the Chuck Jones' version of the duck, the more greedy and egotistical one, rather than the complete lunatic one, but it does serve well his job here, so I can't complain.Porky is just Porky, but he too does pretty well, and I liked the use of Petunia, she was really entertaining in her on way, and her design was really loveable.The Alien invader too had his moments, his design is maybe simple but pretty efficient, it clearly pays homage to the classic Sci-Fi movies of the 40's, just like the rest of the movie does.And the thing about the mind-controlling Gum gives life to some images that managed to be both funny and hideous.So, all in all, a perfect Looney Tunes plot, that to many though may come out as too simple or void of any originality, and while I do agree that they could've been a bit more ambitious in terms of the plot, and that some of the gags don't really work out, I also think that all in all you should take this as a sincere Love Letter to the characters and their legacy, a good way to introduce them to new audiences, and to remember to old fans that this is N-N-N-Not All Folks, yet!",7.0,FelNetti96,2024-11-10,3.0,5.0
870360,No summary,"I loved the expressiveness of the characters and the fluidity of the animation. However, some of the writing felt a bit stale and scattered. Since this is a movie geared toward children (like most Warner Brothers movies I know of), I'm pretty sure they will enjoy it. Kids were clearly the main focus, so more power to them. For parents, teens, or just adults in general-not so much. There were too many moments that oozed cringe, tropes repeated time and again, and other scenes that felt plain annoying or predictable. The only moment that caught me off guard was the main ""antagonist,"" though even that felt more random than humorous.Again, this is a kid's movie, but some children around age 10 might not find it laughable. Of course, this is all a matter of personal taste, but I enjoy it when animated films give backstories to their villains or provide motivations that make me care. It would have been better if the characters pursued their goals with more heart, rather than trying (and failing) to be comedic. A balance could have been struck, but this movie clearly missed it.",,Xavier00,2024-11-08,6.0,2.0
870360,No summary,"Full Title : A Honest Review on The Day The Earth Blew Up : A Looney Tunes Movie, Warner Bros First Ever 2D Animated Theatrical Looney Tunes Film from an Non-Looney Tunes Fan.Well..Warner Bros decide to not make a stupid decision for once, instead of keep their first animated theatrical release looney tunes movie shelved forever or cancelled they release their animated film on the big screen ...that's surprising if i'm gonna be totally honest here.Okay so i watch that movie yesterday along with Joker 2 Folie a Deux (which i will talk about that movie in a different post) and i have some thoughts on it.Before i begin the review, some things first :For those who don't know, I'm Not a Looney Tunes Fan, never was and never will be. I was never a fan of Looney Tunes throughout my life because the large majority of the characters are annoying and unfunny (especially the popular ones) and their humor is lazy, uncreative, repetitive and pure cringe for a large of the time, very rarely i found a short from the looney tunes library that i actually like and made laugh, a consider the looney tunes cartoons the most overrated cartoons ever that don't deserve their popularity and i hate the looney tunes and cartoon communities/fanbases that over praise these cartoons when there are tones of other cartoons that deserve it and get butthurt if someone hates and criticise looney tunes for legit reasons which this leads to them having huge bias and double standards.So yeah, don't act surprised when i fight back to you if you gonna be a jackass to me, telling me that i have no childhood and/or no good taste in humor just because i dare to not like a popular cartoon that i found very overrated and not funny.However Considering that this is Warner Bros First Ever Animated Looney Tunes Film on the Big Screen (very depressing and confusing that the looney tunes didn't have a animated theatrical release movie for over a century, like what Warner Bros were doing the hull time?) i'm willing to give it a chance.I will talk about the Pros and the Cons of this movie.Also This is a Non-Spoiler Review, so i won't spoil major events of this movie.So...what do i think of this movie?....it's Fine....it's surely not the best from the looney tunes but definitely not the absolute worst i have seen.Let's start off with positives, Pros.Voice Acting : The thing that the Looney tunes are mostly consistent about is the voice acting, all the voice actors/actress were on point & the match the tone of the emotions of the characters, Eric Bauza is perfect as Daffy and match the tone how crazy this character is, as a example.Animation : What can i say, the animation was beautiful, fluent, fast and crazy, it's good to see traditional 2d animation on the big screen, When Porky and Petunia go out and fought the mind control people is where animation goes nuts.Comedy : There are times when the movie made laugh especially when they failed at every job they get at the beginning of the movie.Now with the Cons.The Rest of the Comedy : There's are sadly times when the movie made me cringe and didn't found funny, when Daffy freakout about the gums is a perfect example i know that he supposed to be unreasonable and consume with madness but it came across very cringe and unfunny to look at and i didn't found funny Petunia's running gag of taste everything to find a new flavor for the gum factory (especially the sponge scene was just stupid) that made Petunia looks very idiotic for all the wrong reasons, what's next Petunia you gonna taste literal poison to find the flavour you want?The Sad Scenes : When the movie goes emotional is so goddamn cringe and stupid, I get what they try to do but it's get to the point that i'm waiting something or someone to stop this nonsense and point out how stupid and cringe it is, i thought i'm watching a comedy cartoon about a crazy duck and pig doing not Saving Private Ryan, Looney tunes aren't deep guys.The Twist : I'm not gonna say what happen the only thing i can said is that was so baffling stupid and nonsensical that didn't make any sense from the story reprective.This was my reactions to that :
WTF?So over all, it was a experience watching this movie.I am disappointing for some the choices the filmmaker makes about the comedy and story but it could have been a lot worse.For their first ever animated theatrical release looney tunes movie it was fine, it is surely way better than the live action looney tunes movies that's for sure but it's not a movie that i will go back and watch again.I'm hoping the next they will make (if they even make another one) will be even better.Rating : 6 of 10.",6.0,nikosafer,2024-11-04,2.0,4.0

And the animation of the film is SO smooth the animation Studios that worked on the film tonic DNA (the most obvious one that if you're talking about the animation of the film) snipple animation, titmouse canada, and Dinamita animacion. And of course you can't talk about looney tunes without talking about the music, after all It is called ""looney TUNES"" not ""looney toons"" (only idiots call It that) Joshua moshier the carl stalling of the movie and looney tunes cartoons is incredble and Josh is mostly a jazz musician he is an amazing conductor and composer, even having a few references of the most overhated era of looney tunes (take a small guess) and the movie's so funny, cute, serious, sad, and scary!

This movie had an incredibly strong start. Laid the groundwork for what could have been a fantastic cinematic piece, but ultimately fails to land a knockout punch.

But, I was completely taken aback.The film starts off in a way that confirmed my initial thoughts. There's a scene where the Maharaj fixates on a female character, and I braced myself for a typical tale of kidnapping or abuse of power, portraying the Maharaj as a villain. But I was wrong. To everyone, the Maharaj is considered a god. This story reveals a world I never imagined could exist, one that may have existed and might still be existing today.From that moment, I was hooked. I was on the edge of my seat, eager to see what would happen next. The movie is filled with unexpected twists and turns, keeping the audience constantly guessing.Jaideep Ahlawat's performance was nothing short of spectacular. I genuinely despised the character he portrayed-he embodied the role of Maharaj like a natural-born villain. Kudos to him. As for Junaid Khan, his debut performance in such a powerful story with a stellar cast was impressive. However, his portrayal of the activist was somewhat lacking.

1171099,No summary,"_""Maharaj""_-a film that promised historical intrigue and courtroom drama-ultimately delivers a lackluster experience. Here's why this movie falls flat:1. **Acting Woes:**
Junaid Khan's acting debut leaves much to be desired. His lackluster performance is a significant drawback. Instead of truly embodying his character, Khan merely makes faces. The other actors fare no better: Sharvari Wagh overacts, Shalini Pandey seems lost, and Jaideep Ahlawat gives a one-note performance¹².2. **Bollywood Tropes:**
The film succumbs to tired Bollywood clichés. Sharvari's character feels straight out of an '80s flirty female archetype, failing to resonate with modern audiences. Meanwhile, the court scene, which should have been riveting, lacks finesse and refinement.3. **Missed Opportunities:**
""Maharaj"" is based on the real-life 1862 Maharaj Libel Case, involving a young Gujarati Hindu named Karsandas Mulji. Unfortunately, the film fails to fully explore the subversive politics and nuances of this historic event.4. **Direction and Screenplay:**
The direction lacks vision, and the screenplay fails to engage. Unexpected twists and emotional moments fall flat due to uninspired execution. The background score, while present, doesn't salvage the overall experience.In summary, ""Maharaj"" misses the mark, leaving viewers longing for a more refined and impactful portrayal of history.

She gives him the impetus every time he's about to give up- and pushes him to fight the good fight- one that him mojo in his legal battle to end this age old exploitative tradition!The viewer despairs but is given hope and you leave feeling uplifted with the overriding message through the film - that you don't need an intermediary to interpret the word of God, you follow your inner connect and create a personal dialogueA must watchNisha JamVwal.",8.0,nishajamvwal78,2024-06-28,1.0,2.0

1171099,No summary,"Just watched the movie. Giving the film 4 stars only because it brought forth a topic/practice from history that I am sure many know not of. It is very interesting, almost shocking, to know that such a practice existed and the masses willingly participated in it, although am not sure how accurately the movie has captured it. Coming to the film - it was very average. With such an interesting topic, they could have done so so so much better. But they failed. The script was poorly written, the characters were not developed and the direction was worse. You never connect with any of the characters. The whole thing is set in 1862, yet nothing feels that way - the dialects, the set up, the costumes - the whole production basically. The only thing that was effective at times was the background score. Coming to the acting - Junaid and Shalini both miss the mark totally. They were very very flat throughout the film. I guess it is a debut for both and that shows throughout the film. You do not feel the emotions of Kishori nor do you feel Karsandas's zeal for reforms, his anguish on learning about Kishori's act with Yadunath or his despair when he thinks he won't be able to fight the cunning Maharaj. Junaid being the guy playing the protagonist is really disappointing. At no point did I root for this guy. Sharvari, although better than these two, is still not effective. The only person who makes you feel anything is Jaideep. Total disgust for his character. He owns his scenes but with such poor direction, even he isn't able to lift the film up.

1171099,No summary,"""Maharaj,"" a riveting Netflix film inspired by the life of journalist Karsan Das Mulji, marks a significant debut for Junaid Khan, son of Bollywood stalwart Aamir Khan. Directed by Karan P Malhotra and produced by Aditya Chopra, the film delves into the historical '1862 Maharaj Libel Case,' offering a dramatic exploration of the tensions between religious conservatism and progressive reform in colonial India.Junaid Khan delivers a sparkling debut performance, bringing to life the spirited journalist who uses his pen as a weapon against oppression. His portrayal of Karsandas is both powerful and inspiring, embodying the qualities of a hero who stands firm in his convictions against formidable adversaries. Alongside him, Jaideep Ahlawat shines with a subtle yet impactful performance, adding depth to the narrative with his seasoned acting prowess.The film's plot, while treading the familiar ground of good versus evil, is enriched by its historical context and the relevance of its themes. The narrative smartly ties the historical exploitation by religious leaders to contemporary issues, making a compelling case for the enduring need for vigilant journalism and societal reform. This thematic depth is one of the film's strongest points, presenting a narrative that resonates across time.Visually, ""Maharaj"" impresses with meticulously designed sets that effectively evoke the period setting, though the visual appeal could be seen as inconsistent at times. The music, described as passable, does not detract from the film's overall impact but fails to elevate the dramatic moments as might be expected in a film of this scale.The screenplay, while robust in parts, shows signs of faltering in others, leaving some narrative threads feeling underdeveloped. However, these moments do not significantly hinder the film's ability to engage and provoke thought.Overall, ""Maharaj"" is a commendable film that not only marks an impressive debut for Junaid Khan but also serves as a tribute to the power of journalism and the enduring fight for justice. It is a film that resonates with the courage to stand on the right side of history, making it a must-watch for those who appreciate historical dramas with a strong message.Rating: 4 out of 5 - ""Maharaj"" is a thought-provoking film that effectively uses its historical backdrop to comment on timeless issues of morality, justice, and the role of the media.

Maharaj filed a defamation case against social reformer and journalist Karsandas Mulji, who exposed his sexual predations disguised as acts of faith.The story could have been written better. Nevertheless, it keeps you engrossed throughout the narrative. It sets the premise, establishes the characters, and helps you understand the public's blind faith in a godman. The courtroom drama should have been exciting and nail-biting, but with excessive cinematic liberties, it feels highly unrealistic, and the climax takes away the punch it could have delivered.Set in 1960, the production value is top-notch, making the story highly believable. However, the movie lacks the emotional depth it was supposed to create, failing to make you root for any character.

Like most period dramas based on stories from 150+ years ago, it represents some fiction and some facts but the movie captures the main essence of the main story. The topic is handled delicately by the director even though the ending seems a bit filmy.The highlight of the movie is the talented Jaideep Ahlawat who looks divinely evil with a chilling and charismatic smile as the movie's titular antagonist. He truly raises the movie with a very subtle performance. Junaid does a decent job as the movie's protagonist in his debut feature. There are some similarities in acting style with his superstar father Aamir but Junaid lacks the screen and vocal presence of his father. He is decent and does a good job in the movie but at this stage doesnt really sparkle as one would hope. It is still a grounded and well performed role in a serious drama. Only time and mainstream movies will tell if he is a commercially viable actor or a good character actor.The other actors are decent especially Shalini Pandey who does a good job. Sharvari looks good and is pretty energetic but her role doesnt help the storyline a lot. The sets, design and costumes are pretty good for a period drama. Some of the dialogs are exceptional. The songs are average and actually not required for a movie of such a genre. Overall a decent watch but nothing great.

1171099,No summary,"""Maharaj,"" directed by Siddarth P. Anand, is a compelling historical drama that revisits the landmark Maharaj Libel Case of 1862. With an engrossing storyline, powerful performances, and meticulous attention to historical detail, the film offers a vivid portrayal of a pivotal moment in Indian legal history and society.Plot Summary
The film centers on the Maharaj Libel Case, a significant legal battle in Bombay during the British Raj. The case involves a young journalist, played by Junaid Khan, who exposes the immoral activities of a powerful religious leader from the Vaishnav sect, portrayed by Jaideep Ahlawat. The resulting defamation lawsuit becomes a landmark case, highlighting the clash between truth and power, and the fight for justice and moral integrity.Acting Performances
Junaid Khan delivers a breakout performance as the courageous journalist. His portrayal of a principled young man standing up against corruption and hypocrisy is both compelling and inspiring. Khan's nuanced acting captures the internal struggles and resilience of his character, making his journey profoundly relatable.Jaideep Ahlawat is equally formidable as the antagonist. His depiction of the charismatic yet morally corrupt Maharaj is chilling. Ahlawat's ability to convey the complexities of a powerful figure facing public scrutiny adds significant depth to the narrative. His performance ensures that the character is not just a one-dimensional villain, but a person with his own vulnerabilities and manipulations.Direction and Cinematography
Siddarth P. Anand's direction is masterful, showcasing his talent for creating a rich, immersive historical setting. His eye for detail is evident in the meticulous recreation of 1860s Bombay, bringing to life the bustling streets, colonial architecture, and socio-political atmosphere of the era. Anand's ability to balance the dramatic courtroom scenes with the broader social context of the time is commendable, making the narrative both gripping and educational.Historical and Cultural Context
The film delves deep into the Vaishnav sect, exploring its beliefs, practices, and the influence of its leaders during the British Raj. Anand presents a balanced view of the sect, highlighting its spiritual significance while also critiquing the corruption that can arise within any institution. This contextual richness adds layers to the story, making it not just a legal drama, but a commentary on the complexities of faith and power.Set Design and Production Values
The set design in ""Maharaj"" is outstanding, capturing the essence of 19th-century Bombay with impressive authenticity.

1020951,No summary,"""Chandu Champion"" is a cinematic triumph that beautifully showcases the power of determination. Directed by Kabir Khan, it tells the journey of Murlikant Petkar, India's first Paralympic gold medalist, played beautifully by Kartik Aaryan. The film emphasizes that if you truly make up your mind to achieve something, no circumstance can hold you back. Kartik Aaryan delivers a heartfelt performance, and the story of Murlikant Petkar is both inspiring and uplifting. It reminded me of ""Broken"" (2014)-though their plots differ, both films highlight the extraordinary feats one can accomplish with unwavering willpower.

1020951,No summary,"Overview:
Chandu Champion is an uplifting sporting tale, which is quite well executed and a pleasant watch.Plot:
The plot centers around Murlikant Petkar, an average village boy who dreams of bringing home an Olympic gold medal for India. Through his story, he switches sports, becomes paralyzed during a war, but keeps on pushing to achieve his dream.This real-life story is inspirational, and makes the audience feel as though anything is possible if you work hard enough.Acting:
This is the kind of role I wanted to see Kartik Aaryan in after Dhamaka. In some ways he has been type cast as a goofy Loverboy, but he is an accomplished actor who can do the serious performances. In Chandu Champion he puts in a very solid performance as Petkar.Aaryan is supported by a very capable Vijay Raaz, as his mentor, Tiger Ali.Music:
The music is generally quite good, a lot of your inspirational fare in a movie like this. Some songs were unnecessary or didn't fit the vibe like the train song.Sets/costumes/makeup:
Sets were pretty good as were the costumes. The makeup, however, was absolutely terrible. Especially when Kartik Aaryan was playing the older version of Murlikant Petkar, They didn't bother to make him look like the real man, but rather just dressed him up as generic old man, with a lousy wig. It looked extremely lazy especially during the credits when the side by side was happening.Conclusion:
It's an enjoyable watch, and overall, a pretty good movie. 7/10.",7.0,AJ9441,2024-10-10,0.0,0.0

Yet, this is such an inspiring, awe-wrecking, emotional story that will make us think about our own challenges, our own resilience in the face of adversity. It is a story involving the army, sports, and life. At some early stages, one might feel some resemblance to Milkha Singh, but the later lives of both persons are very different.

His performance was so powerful that I regret missing the theatre experience-surely, I would have cried at the end.This movie's inspiration goes beyond any fictional tale. Petkar's determination and refusal to give up, despite all odds, is incredible. It's a great source of motivation, showing what true resilience looks like. Every aspect-the storyline, characters, and music-comes together in a perfectly balanced, 100/100 experience.

1020951,No summary,"A number of biopics have been made on sports persons and now the novelty is probably wearing off . This movie suffers because of a familiar plot and because it is similar to "" Bhag Milkha Bhag"" and "" Lal Singh Chaddha "" in some ways. It is a true story about a village boy who dreams of winning an Olympic gold medal in wrestling . Circumstances make him a soldier in the Indian Army where he does well in the boxing arena. Later he becomes paralyzed waist down due to battle injury and this leads him into depression. Through sheer will power and grit he is able to take part in para Olympics and fulfill his dream of winning a gold medal in swimming.Kabir Khan uses the talent of Kartik Aaryan to make a fairly impressive film but one gets the feeling of deja vu throughout. We have seen it all. No doubt Kartik has impressed us with his acting and his transition from a village bumpkin to a soldier to a boxer to a swimming champ has been chronicled well. Kartik has given a praiseworthy performance. Director Kabir Khan has done well but he has given us better movies like Bajrangi bhaijaan.

This film, based on real events, resonates deeply and leaves a lasting impact.The narrative is both powerful and moving, following Chandu's (Murlikant Petkar's) life as he pursues his dream of winning an Olympic gold for India. His journey is filled with challenges, from his early days as a promising boxer to the life-altering injuries he sustains during the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965. The film does an incredible job of portraying his internal struggle and eventual triumph, making the audience feel every moment of his pain, determination, and ultimate victory.The performances are top-notch, with the lead actor delivering a performance that is both heart-wrenching and inspiring. He embodies Chandu's resilience, portraying both his physical limitations and mental strength with authenticity and grace. The supporting cast, particularly the actor playing his coach Tiger Ali, adds depth to the story, showcasing the mentor's tough love and unwavering belief in Chandu's potential.The direction is seamless, with the filmmaker handling the sensitive and challenging subject matter with care. The war scenes are intense and realistic, while the sports sequences are thrilling and will have you on the edge of your seat. The emotional core of the film, however, lies in Chandu's personal journey, which is depicted with such sincerity that it's impossible not to be moved.The cinematography is another highlight, capturing both the vast landscapes and the intimate moments with equal finesse. The film's pacing is perfect, allowing the story to unfold naturally while keeping the audience engaged throughout.

One of the most inspiring sports drama biopics of all times about a real life sports hero that remained in the shadows for far too long. Just like the actual lead character of the movie ""Murlikant Petkar"", Chandu Champion deserves to be recognized for its achievement.....of being a heartwarming and inspiring sports biopic.Kudos to Kabir Khan to bring such an amazing story to the silver screen and doing justice to its hero and his almost unbelievable story. The Kartik Aaryan who turns up to play the lead character is not the Kartik Aaryan of his previous 15 movies. This is not the fast talking smart ass of the Luv Ranjan comedies or fast talking smart ass Rooh Baba of Bhool Bhulaiya or the fast talking smart ass of most of his other movies or even the weird slow talking dumb ass sociopathic dentist of Freddy.....this is someone completely new and different. Several images of Kartik Aaryan's physical transformation for the role surfaced before the movie's release, which was actually not even the hardest transformation that he underwent for the role.....he literally transformed him as an actor for this role and Kabir Khan deserves the credit for bring out this new Kartik Aaryan for the screen.Vijay Raaz is a real gem as he effortlessly infuses emotions and humor into his character and lifts the movie everytime he is on screen. The sports choreography and cinematography is exceptional. The movie is fast paced, crisp and engaging and doesnt stray from its core except for one unnecessary song which wasnt really needed. The other character actors also do a good job in their respective roles even though they dont have much time onscreen. It is a shame that the movie didnt get the recognition and success it deserved during its theatrical run, just like the movie's protagonist for most of his life. However there is still time to experience, enjoy and appreciate the movie, just like the movie's protagonist deserved.I couldn't watch the movie in theater in the US because of its limited release in this part of the world. I wasn't even looking forward to watching it on OTT because of the poor box office and generally subdued word of mouth even though its reviews were pretty good. I decided to finally watch it Friday night, almost a week after its OTT release on August 9th and was blown away. The movie is fantastic and Kartik Aaryan is exceptional. We need more of such movies that are well made and tell inspiring tales. It doesnt matter if you like or dislike Kartik Aaryan.....It doesnt matter if you like or dislike Kabir Khan's movies.....It doesnt matter if you like or dislike sports movies.....if you like good cinema, if you value history and if you want to feel good and warm inside, then watch Chandu Champion.

Not sure if the film was promoted well, nevertheless having seen the film, I doff my hat to Kabir for bringing to screen the story of a lesser known hero.Kartik has performed well both physically and emotionally, but Vijay Raaz steals the show for me with his dialog delivery. Other well-known faces like Shreyas, Brajendra, Sonali, Rajpal add some star value, which might not have been required. One more mention for Bhuvan (Karnail) with his chiseled body challenges Kartik's prep ;)His family story post-marriage is not explored enough though. BGM is good and keeps you engaged.

The acting could have been superior if not for the overt maneuver.The acting of Vijay Raaz was subtle and manipulative. The strategies drawn by him to put him at the top of his game again was banal.

1020951,No summary,"Let me start by saying that watching *Chandu Champion* was a colossal waste of time and money. This movie is a prime example of everything wrong with Bollywood these days. From the cringe-worthy acting to the laughable special effects, there wasn't a single moment where I felt entertained or engaged.Firstly, the plot was as predictable as sunrise. A cliché story of an underdog trying to become a champion in some obscure sport (which they failed to properly explain). The screenplay felt like it was written by a middle-schooler who just discovered dramatic tropes and wanted to use every single one of them. The dialogues were so insipid that I found myself rolling my eyes more often than I blinked.Let's talk about the performances, if we can call them that. The lead actor, who seemed like he was pulled out of an amateur theatre workshop, displayed a range of expressions varying from confused to constipated. His attempts at emoting were so cringe-inducing that I started rooting for the villain, who was equally unimpressive with his over-the-top evil laughs and cartoonish gestures.And don't even get me started on the music. The songs were forgettable at best and ear-gratingly bad at worst. I swear, the background score was so poorly mixed that it felt like a cacophony of random noises rather than music meant to enhance the scenes.Special effects? What special effects? I've seen better CGI in YouTube videos made by teenagers in their basement. The scenes meant to be action-packed were just plain laughable. It was as if the filmmakers decided to cut corners by using outdated software from the early 2000s.To sum it up, *Chandu Champion* is a disaster of a film that should serve as a cautionary tale for anyone thinking of entering the film industry without a shred of talent or creativity. Save yourself the agony and skip this one.",1.0,janasorl,2024-06-22,11.0,19.0
1020951,No summary,"Chandu champion is a biography sports war action drama historical film directed by kabir khan.Kartik aaryan has unarguably given his best performance till date. He still holds his that boyish, teeth-widening smile, which we are used to, but this attribute gives the character of murlikant petkar an edge. It tells us how mature that chandu champion has become, to culture and morph into a gold champion. His dialogue delivery, still needs work alongwith his expressions, but he will get better with these kind of serious films. Another actor, without whom this film is incomplete is vijay raaz. Whenever he comes on screen, he lights it up. How unused he still is by bollywood, it amazes me! His scenes with aaryan are the most efficient ones. He makes the latter work hard in those scenes, and this works. Bhuvan arora plays the usual happy-go-lucky punjabi, which is still stereotypical. Shreyas talpade, rajpal yadav and brijendra kala make some impactful cameos.Another aspect I would like to appreciate is the hindi accent with the marathi twang, used by the characters when the story was in sangli, maharashtra. It lent a great rootedness. The writing follows the known rise-fall-rise template of sports dramas, and uses it effectively. Kabir khan has made sure that the tropes don't feel generic. The first half writing takes its time to build up, the emotions remain raw. But the second half, really comes into its own and you are bound to shed a tear or two by the end of it. The comic punches are inconsistent. Some land, some don't. The background score is effective, the music is noteworthy. 'Satyanas' reminds us of 'galti se mistake' very much. The title track is also very energetic.I wish the film felt more emotionally attached to me. It kept me distant and detached in quite some portions of the film. The dialogues are good.Watch out for some scenes, for instance, the one shot war sequence before the interval. That was brilliant cinematography and continuity, in my opinion. The boxing matches could have had more nuance to it, but it is difficult to portray one sport into one film authentically, let alone two. Though, the swimming portion have been shot well, and the finals where murlikant's life and struggles flash before his eyes elicit great emotions.",8.0,puranjanbasak,2024-06-22,1.0,1.0

Just as he brought out stellar performances from Salman Khan in Bajrangi Bhaijaan and Ranveer Singh as Kapil Dev in '83, Kabir Khan has masterfully guided Kartik Aaryan in portraying Petkar. The film vividly brings to life the three sporting arenas that shaped Petkar's journey - a village wrestling pit, a Military Games boxing ring, and a Paralympic swimming pool.Kartik Aaryan delivers award-winning and his career-best performance. He completely immerses himself in the character of Murlikant Petkar, delivering an outstanding performance. His physical transformation for the role is commendable, and he brings an emotional depth that resonates with the audience. Vijay Raaz gives a powerful performance.

1020951,No summary,"Chandu Champion is the story of Paralympic Athlete Mr. Murlikant Petkar. The character is portrayed by teen star Karthik Aryan and directed by veteran director Mr. Kabir Khan. Quite a few sports drama films in the past decade have done quite well at the box office however a fatigue seems to set in around a similar theme.Recently released sports drama film Maidaan which was based around the same era and again inspired from a real life story failed to get good footfalls at the box office even though the movie was well praised by critics and audiences both. So, will Chandu Champion overcome this barrier at the box office that time will only tell. However, full credits to the filmmaker and his team and cast for presenting this story with sincerity keeping the audience engaged to a worthwhile 145 minutes.The story of Mr. Murlikant starts in a small village by the name of Islampur in Sangli district of Maharashtra. The year is 1952 when a young Murlikant goes with his brother to a railway station where Mr. KD Jadhav who had won bronze for India in wrestling is welcomed by quite a few thousand people. This inspires young Murli to bring Gold for India in wrestling in Olympics. What happens next forms the story of the movie.Full marks to be given to the makers for depicting various facets of Mr Murlikant's life. Each facet is presented with the right impact and stitched together to form the whole movie. It shows the understanding of an experienced stalwart like Mr Kabir Khan here as a master story teller.Karthik Aryan has really worked hard for this role. It can be seen the multiple art forms he had to learn to portray the role well. Even the physical transformation is fantastic. He is growing with every movie of his and going forward has all signs of being the next superstar of Indian cinema.In the supporting cast quite a few standout however Mr. Vijay Raaz should be named for his excellent work.The music and songs are designed for the flow of the movie and don't create a desire to listen again as such.The production design is top notch along with fantastic camera work which makes the whole experience of the movie a complete win win.You can watch it with your whole family and to get the best of the experience it is advisable to book your tickets at the best theater around you rather than waiting for OTT release.",8.0,rohittib,2024-06-19,1.0,1.0

Chandu ChampionThis film deserves a National Award.It is a remarkable portrayal of a real-life hero Murlikant Petkar from a remote village of Sangli , who crossed all the hurdles and obstacles to become India's first Paralympic gold medalist in 1972.This story is extremely, motivational, inspiring, highlighting the power of victory and showing the human spirit.It left a lasting impression on me.With great authenticity, Kartik Aaryan has done a powerful performance, and all the actors, specifically Vijay Raj, are excellent.A compelling narrative & flawless direction by talented and visionary Director Kabir Khan.Film narrates the remarkable journey of Murlikant Petkar as Chandu, a determined athlete who starts from zero and achieved 100, rises from darkness to achieve greatness.Our general perception is that if respect is not given, it is wise to leave the table. But what if you decide to sit at the table, forcing people to acknowledge your presence? Ultimately, the most determined people win. Commendable explained by Kabir, ""It is about developing yourself as a champion, even when the world calls you Chandu/ Chomu ko ..., or make you laughing object.""

1020951,No summary,"""Chandu Champion"" is a stirring cinematic portrayal of resilience and triumph against the odds, directed by Kabir Khan and featuring a standout performance by Kartik Aaryan. The film, which chronicles the life of Murlikant Petkar, India's first Paralympic gold medalist, captivates with its potent blend of drama, inspiration, and action.From the outset, the film sets a gripping tone. We first meet Petkar as he awakens from a two-year coma, a consequence of his injuries sustained during military service. This dramatic re-entry into consciousness is both haunting and hopeful, immediately drawing the audience into his tumultuous journey. The narrative then skillfully transitions to his childhood, where young Murli, fondly nicknamed ""Chandu Champion,"" harbors dreams of greatness.Kartik Aaryan's portrayal of Petkar is nothing short of transformative. Known for his roles in lighter, comedic fare, Aaryan demonstrates remarkable range and depth, embodying the physical and emotional struggles of his character with authenticity and intensity. His dedication to the role is evident in his physical transformation and the raw emotion he brings to the screen, capturing Petkar's indomitable spirit and unwavering determination.The screenplay, co-written by Kabir Khan and Neeraj Udhwani, deftly balances the various phases of Petkar's life, ensuring that each moment, whether triumphant or tragic, resonates with the audience. The film's pacing allows viewers to fully immerse themselves in Petkar's journey, from the initial ridicule he faces to his eventual rise as a national hero. This narrative structure not only highlights the personal and societal challenges Petkar overcomes but also serves as a broader commentary on the resilience of the human spirit.One of the film's strengths lies in its depiction of the socio-political environment of the time. The challenges faced by disabled athletes in India, particularly during Petkar's era, are poignantly portrayed, adding depth to the narrative. The film doesn't shy away from depicting the harsh realities of the prejudice and lack of support that Petkar faced, making his eventual triumph all the more inspiring.Kabir Khan's direction is meticulous, with each scene crafted to enhance the emotional and visual impact of the story. The action sequences, particularly those depicting Petkar's sporting events, are exhilarating and shot with a dynamic intensity that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. Cinematographer Aseem Mishra's use of close-ups and wide shots creates a visual narrative that complements the film's emotional arc, while Pritam's musical score underscores the film's dramatic and uplifting moments perfectly.The supporting cast, including notable performances by actors like Pankaj Tripathi and Ananya Panday, adds further depth to the film. Tripathi, in particular, shines in his role as Petkar's mentor, providing a steady, grounding presence that contrasts with Petkar's fiery determination. Panday's role, though smaller, is impactful, highlighting the importance of familial and emotional support in Petkar's journey.""Chandu Champion"" is not just a sports biopic; it's a heartfelt tribute to a man who defied the odds and a celebration of perseverance and the relentless pursuit of dreams. The film's ability to inspire and evoke a range of emotions is a testament to the collaborative effort of its cast and crew, led by Kabir Khan's visionary direction and Kartik Aaryan's compelling performance.In conclusion, ""Chandu Champion"" stands out as a powerful, inspirational film that will leave a lasting impression on its audience.

1020951,No summary,"Chandu Champion (2024) :
Movie Review -Kartik Aaryan finally gets into character-driven zones with Kabir Khan's inspiring tale, based on the life of Padma Shri recipient Mr. Muralikant Petkar, aka Chandu Champion. What the film deminded from Kartik and Kabir was a full submission to the craft, as the writing was already good since Petkar's life was so inspiring. It usually happens that biopics are safer than fictional stories because they have more realistic sense and more inspirational stuff to offer. Chandu Champion has a champion-like story coming from Muralikant Petkar's life, well-handled by Kabir Khan as the storyteller more than a director. His direction can still be at fault for those flaws we see in the film, but as a storyteller, he completely wins.In the early 50s, kid Muralikant is taken to a Karad station to see Khashaba Jadhav as he returns from a historic Olympic win. Little Murali, unaware of things, decides to win the Olympic Gold Medal for India and enters Kusti ka akhada. Grown-up Murali (Kartik Aaryan) is teased as ""Chandu Champion"" by locals and is called Kaccha Limbu by his own coach. The perception changes when he beats the opponent Pahalwan in a fight that he was supposed to lose, and then he is ran out of the village, only to find a new direction for his career-the Army. In the Army, Murali is guided by Tiger Ali (Vijay Raaj) in the boxing ring and becomes a sensation at the Olympics. With Gold being so close to him, Murali loses his concentration due to the glamour and glitter around him and loses the final. In 1965's war, he is hit by 9 bullets but still survives, only to be left with paralyzed legs. Will he be able to complete his dream of winning gold for India?With a considerable amount of fiction and a tell-me-the-same-story kind of presentation, Chandu Champion feels inspiring but repetitive. Vijay Raaj asks Chandu, ""Kabhi suni hai aise stories?"" The entire fault of repetitive cinema lies here in this line. What can we do if the stories are so similar to each other? There might be hundreds of Muralikant Petkars all over the world inspiring millions to ""never give up,"" but in our Maharashtra, we only had one Muralikant Petkar, no? What's wrong with telling his story, even if it is similar to many others? This is where every director and screenwriter should work. They can define cinema through new lenses if they can summarize the same story in a different format, in different ratios, and in different ways. The ultimate truth should remain the same.Talking about flaws, I didn't get how a man who has run out of a village in Langot can directly go to an army camp and get admission. Don't they ask for any documents? Also, the fact that the glitter disturbs your concentration doesn't seem like a big conflict in movies anymore. Even if we think about the 1960s, Milkha Singh went through a similar conflict, so Petkar could have easily avoided that (in real life and reel life, both). Didn't his married life deserve that one chunk of screen space? Besides these, I don't think there are any major flaws in the movie. It's a very good story with a sortable screenplay (which could have been better if we look at how Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and Dangal were handled). Khan's storytelling reminds you of his own previous works, if you look carefully. In 83's last scene, you see little Sachin Tendulkar on his brother's shoulder, and here you see a little girl on her father's shoulder waving at Padma Shri winner Petkar. I must say, that flashback trick is older than Petkar's real age, so Kabir Khan really needs to improvise himself there.Speaking of performances, Chandu Champion entirely belongs to two people: Kartik Aryan and Vijay Raaj. Kartik finally gets to play a challenging role (since it's a biopic), which demands physical and characteristic changes throughout the narrative. He does well. But how well? Compared to his own previous works, I can confidently say that Chandu Champion is Kartik Aaryan's best performance so far. Yes, in some scenes he brings that old and natural Kartik to spoil the sculptor, but nothing damageable. No more rom-com mediocrity; no more of that chocolate boy tag anymore. He has destroyed that image at once. Vijay Raaj nails the role of Tiger Ali. He is bindass; he is fearless; he is hopeful; and he is funny too. Rajpal Yadav's role seems important but it has been showcased with a lot of mediocrity. ""Yayich hai"" and ""Apunich hai"" kinds of language didn't seem appropriate for the 1960s (for any character). Yashpal Sharma and Shreyas Talpade are wasted in cringe-worthy roles, while Ganesh Yadav fits well for that small role. I am not sure whether Bhagyashri Borse's role was really necessary here. A journalist being so close to contestants during lunch and practice sessions isn't plausible at all. Yet, she looked cute, and I personally wouldn't mind having such a lovely lady nearby (but it's cinema, and I am a critic after all). Talented Sonali Kulkarni gets a small role but does fine, as did the other supporting cast members.Chandu Champion lacks musical finesse. I don't know from where that ""Satyanaas"" song appeared. The lyrics and the tone did not suit the situation at all. ""Sarfira"" was okay, but those situations needed a much more inspirational song. The cinematography was good, the sound design was decent, and the production value was high. Kabir Khan has proved that he can't really make a ""bad film"" every time (except a few), and the emotional pull he has is much better than that of other directors (except Hirani). Chandu Champion isn't his best work, but it's not bad or average either. Most of the credit goes to Muralikant Perkar's life because the story he has to share with us all is just INCREDIBLE. More than Kartik and Kabir, I really want to meet this man and salute him for whatever he has achieved in his life. Kis mitti ka bana hai ye banda? I really want to find out now.RATING - 6/10*",6.0,SAMTHEBESTEST,2024-06-14,8.0,9.0

1167351,No summary,"Longing is an English reboot directed, written and partly produced by Savi Gabizon, who released a similar French Hebrew version called Ga'agua in 2017.Businessman Daniel Bloch (Richard Gere) lives a rich life and never wanted children. When he learns from an old girlfriend that they had a son, but he has died, Daniel decides to immerse himself in the old life of his unknown, surviving son. In this way he learns about his life choices and is confronted with the mistakes he has made. He tries to correct these, so that he can leave him with dignity.Despite the fact that this is a reboot of an earlier, similar film, you would expect the writer-director to have worked it out a bit more. However, there are logical details missing, which makes the film seem vague, far-fetched, or sometimes unintentionally comical instead of truly dramatic or emotional.Because the father tries to live the life of his surviving son, many moments come to the fore in the film. Because you as a viewer have not really experienced this son, this revival seems rather long-winded than really emotional. Many scenes also go on for too long or have unnecessary, short scenes between the events.Due to the lack of good direction and writing direction, the cast members also seem somewhat uncertain and unclear, which means you do not really care about their characters.

1222140,No summary,"Golam (2024) :
Brief Review -There is no perfect crime, but there can be a perfect group murder! I am sorry if I have spoiled your dish here, but that's one way of catching your attention and bringing it to this well-made thriller. We can call it a murder mystery more than a thriller because... well, you'll understand when you watch the film. Revenge and human conscience are two theories that even make someone's murder justified because it's more like self-defense. Drishyam showed us how. Similarly, Golam does it in its own style, but instead of one man or a woman, you have to make a group murder. This also boosts its screenplay and storyline because getting away with a murder alone is more difficult than doing it in a group. With a group, you are much safer and are entitled to get away because the law has its own terms. As they say, if a single man does it, it's a murder. If a group does it, it's Vadh/Slaughter/Penalty/or whatever you call it. Golam still keeps many things unrevealed for its sequel, and we all can guess that there will be another murder, another perfect crime. So, the film is about the death of an MD of the V-Tech company, who has asthma. He goes to the bathroom and is then found after a while. When others are of the opinion that it's an accident, the main investigating officer has his own doubts. He dives deep into the case and discovers many unknown secrets that put him in a difficult situation since his job is to catch criminals rather than think about what's justice and what's not. Will he be able to do his duty? Ranjith Sajeev, as a cop, does a fine job, and the big supporting cast has also done well. Samjad's direction and screenplay with Praveen are what make it a thrilling affair, despite the main spoiler being openly revealed in the review. It's not about who did the murder, but it's about why and how. Watch Golam to know more.RATING - 6.5/10*By - #samthebestest.",6.0,SAMTHEBESTEST,2024-11-20,0.0,0.0

1222140,No summary,"An investigation thriller, when done right, makes for a riveting watch, and this film does just that. After receiving good reviews and decent box office numbers, I was eager to watch it as soon as it landed on OTT.The movie unravels in a single day and centers on the investigation of the murder of the MD of an IT company, which takes place in the office itself. All the employees become suspects, leading to a search for the motive and the real culprit.Ranjith Sajeev, as the investigative officer who is relatively new to the industry, delivers a confident performance and shines throughout the runtime. His persona and physicality suit the character to a T. Alencier Ley Lopez, as the Circle Inspector, adds sassiness to the movie and performs well. Then comes a series of debutants and supporting actors who do full justice to their respective roles.Though you might guess the suspense midway, the film keeps you hooked as the motive and execution are yet to be revealed. The brilliance of the writing lies in its ability to turn a simple office setting into a murder ground. Dileesh Pothan, Sunny Wayne, and Siddique have cameos that are brilliantly integrated into the movie, making their parts prominent and adding much-needed face value for business. There isn't a single scene added just for the heck of it; everything serves a purpose.The BGM is apt, contributing to the building tension. There are virtually no loopholes, a difficult feat to achieve in movies like this. Director Samjad, by co-writing with Praveen Viswanath, has crafted a solid film and paved the way for a potential second part.Rightly so, this low-budget movie must be watched as it stays true to its genre. Unfortunately, because the lead isn't as popular as other stars, the film didn't receive the recognition it deserved.

Also, a lot of newbie actors and actresses have been given opportunities in this movie, and none of them failed on screen. Each of them delivered a good performance.

1222140,No summary,"A howdunnit murder mystery with an interesting story turned into a script that needs more drafts. The direction with the use of camera and music tries to cover up any weakness in the script which kind of works by the second half of the movie. The over-the-top use of music reminded me of how some soap operas use plagiarised over-the-top action music from movies for no reason while showing close-ups of everyone in that scene. Even though this was only two hours, it could still have trimmed another twenty minutes out of it and it would've worked better. The lead actor wasn't particularly bad but besides his chiselled body and stoic posture, he couldn't really bring the audience to care for him as the lead. But all the other supporting cast did their roles really well. The moments where I first thought their acting was a bit over the top were justified to be like that once the mystery starts unravelling. The different demography of people in an office setup felt quite real for the current time and not in the stereotypical way that is usually seen in movies.There are a lot of aspects that may feel silly but the film manages to be engaging especially in the second half, and I felt I could forgive a lot of its mistakes. The film ends with a promise of a sequel which I can only imagine to be much bigger in scope and I don't think that is really viable with the current setup.On the whole, despite all its issues, it felt like a commendable attempt of an investigation thriller that tries something different in Malayalam, even though it clearly borrows a lot from Agatha Christie to CSI.",6.0,Jithindurden,2024-06-12,5.0,5.0

Nevertheless, this film may have been a solid investigative thriller if it had a new storyline and had a few more talented performers. The movie frequently shifts in tempo and veers away from the intended message. The main character, who pointlessly snaps and then examines a photo on his phone, is the best illustration of this. Both the screenplay and the story are old. This one has every element common to all other investigative thrillers. Just one viewing of the film is sufficient.

The voice cast includes Christopher Sean (You), Tamlyn Tomita (The Day After Tomorrow), Gedde Watanabe (Sixteen Candles), and Hiro Nakamura.This is one of those films with just enough good elements to make it worth watching, but not enough to be truly great. The animation and depiction of the universe are impressive, with both the monsters and Ultraman standing out. However, the characters were hit or miss. While I liked the hero and the villain, I wasn't as invested in the baby monster subplot. The villain's motivations were well-developed and justifiable. The ""Gigantron"" in the film reminded me of Rodan, and the final monster battle was solid, with a well-written resolution.In conclusion, Ultraman: Rising features fantastic animation and enough elements of the monster universe to make it worth a watch. However, some aspects of the film, particularly the more child-oriented, cheesy moments, detract from its depth and quality. I would score this a 5.5-6/10 and only recommend it with the appropriate expectations.",6.0,kevin_robbins,2024-08-26,1.0,0.0

There are a few surprises, but they're out of left field and stay unexplained.It was still an enjoyable movie to pass time. And the place it gets bumped up from ""just OK"" to ""pretty good"" is the excellent use of craft. There are dozens of scenes with excellent framing that could be frozen and used as pictures in their own right. ILM made great use of Dreamwork's ""Moonbeam"" program to convey the world. The textures are photorealistic enough to draw one in, while the exaggerated features enhance the personalities of the cartoon characters portrayed.

829402,No summary,"I really disliked the storyline in this movie because it goes against everything that Ultraman is suppose to stand for and do throughout all the Ultraman Films and the anime itself, but the animation was good but definitely not better then the Netflix Ultraman anime thats for sure. If you had to compare it...you could tell this films animation was made to look kid friendly PG13, while the animation in the anime was meant to be more rated teen, kinda like comparing Barney with Jurassic Park lol or Captain Planet with X-Men, the differences are huge and noticable. See the story is about Ultraman trying to protect Kaiju's lol... ridiculous as it sounds.. I kean sure in the anime they also protected alien monsters but only the good and civil ones, while killing the bad ones but in this film Ultraman is literallly trying to save even Kaijus that just attacked and wreaked havoc on the cities and people. Ultraman is giving rights to mindless monsters that just destroyed and killed.. rights to protect their lives from excessive force lmao .. honestly this film was a joke.. I know it has good ratings by ppl but most of the ppl commenting don't seem to be long time fans of the franchise.. so they may understand less about the contradictions and ridiculousness of the plot of this film,So it looks like they will be trying to make a followup film judging by the ending... but so I don't ruin it for people I will just say it seems very predictable what the next plot might be about... for anyone who watched the special ending credits scene that appears I will just say I bet you the next film will be about Kaiju Island lol... lets just say its where he will find what hes searching for.

829402,No summary,"'Ultraman: Rising (2024)' is an animated adventure about a baseball player who reluctantly returns to Japan to take on the mantle of Ultraman when his father becomes injured and can no longer fulfil the role. The man's struggles to balance the two halves of his life are further complicated when he must shelter and care for an infant Kaiju who the ruthless Kaiju Defence Force want to capture for nefarious purposes. At two hours in length, the picture is too long for its own good. It's never especially boring or overly drawn out, but there's a sense that it isn't as zippy as it should be. It's fairly enjoyable even during its least compelling segments, but it's the sort of thing that would be more entertaining if it was tightened up a little bit. Generally speaking, it's a perfectly decent effort. It isn't all that compelling and it has this strange, almost made-for-TV sheen that's likely a result of it being a Netflix original. That's not to say it's unsuccessful, just that it never quite feels like a real movie. Still, it's fairly fun on occasion and is visually vibrant throughout. Although some of its designs are a little odd (although I can't quite put my finger on why), its animation is lively and suitably stylised. It has a few engaging set-pieces and a decent emotional through line. Although some elements of its plot aren't explored as deeply as they ought to be and, generally speaking, its narrative is a little messy, the piece has a solid understanding of what it wants to do and it does it reasonably well. I'm not particularly enthusiastic about any of it, but it's good enough for what it is and sometimes that's just fine.",6.0,Pjtaylor-96-138044,2024-07-15,1.0,0.0

829402,No summary,"As an Ultraman fan and someone who likes science fiction animation movies, I loved Ultraman Rising.The storyline follows a baseball player named Ken Sato (Christopher Sean) who left Japan for the United States with his mother when he was young and became a famous baseball player. Now he needs to return to Tokyo to take over the role of Ultraman because his dad (Gedde Watanabe) asks him to come and take a bigger role in his life. He lives with a robot named Mina (Tamlyn Tomita) who helps him in his tasks. One day, while fighting Ken finds a Kaiju egg and knows that he needs to learn to care for the baby Kaiju and learn the importance of family. A man named Dr. Onda (Keone Young) wants to destroy all the kaijus, he wants to take revenge because his family died in a kaiju attack.The animation by the Sunrise team is really great - sometimes I forgot I was watching an animation. The actors' voices match the characters quite well. Director and writer, Shannon Tindle and co-director, John Aoshima, even including something from the original series - at the beginning it shows the kaiju from the first episode of Ultraman. They also incorporated some very funny scenes and lines, like the baby kaiju going wild! I really love the baby's incidents - they are so funny. Don't leave your seat too soon at the end or you will miss an important part of the story. I want to mention that I noticed that there are some flashing lights in some scenes, so people sensitive to stroboscopic flashes may be affected.The film's message is that family is the most important thing in your life. Also, you can't deny anything you don't like. Ken tried to find solutions, but they all weren't good enough.I give Ultraman Rising 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 12, plus adults and Ultraman fans.

But hold on, because that unexpected turn wasn't a bad thing at all.Sure, the epic Kaiju battles I craved were there, but in smaller doses. Instead, the film surprised me with a heartwarming family story. Here's the deal and a mild spoiler so that you don't flip this on and say, what the hell did they do to Ultraman (just in case you didn't pay attention to the poster art, like me).Our hero, Ken, is a former athlete thrust back into the world of Ultraman - a legacy passed down through generations. Only this time, the burden of heroism clashes with his everyday struggles as a single dad and that is where the true heart of the film lies in the surprisingly touching relationship between Ken and a newly hatched baby Kaiju.While the plot might lean towards a familiar family-friendly formula, it's executed well. The humor is spot-on, and the characters, even the villain (looking at you, Professor Sato, you slightly underwhelming mastermind), are endearing.""Ultraman: Rising"" might not be the Kaiju throwdown you expected, but it's a thoroughly enjoyable ride with a surprising amount of heart and great to watch with your kids of almost all ages (because you know, teenagers).

There is some sort of Kaiju Defense Force that also fights kaijus. Somehow, this film becomes the story of Ultraman defending a kaiju baby from the KDF, which is ironic, but kind of fun.However, the true strength (and weakness) of the movie is not in the monster battles, but in the story of a young man trying to juggle career, family, child raising and personal life at the same time. Did I want this in a Kaiju movie?

999621,No summary,"I graduated from HS in 1989. John Hughes' movies and the cast of each are woven into my life. I never paid attention to the title of ""Brat Pack"". I didn't know where it came from, nor did I care. I understand now that it was a typecast problem for those like Andrew McCarthy, after having watched this documentary. I hoped before the end that he would give credit to the fans and consumers of the product instead of completely conceding to this writer that I never knew existed before watching this. These movies were such a part of me. I related to the gentleman who said he was, ""team Duckie"". I was Duckie (female version)! I never compromised on who I was or my style. I took a lot of flack for it because in my small hometown, it wasn't the way to ""be"". This moment in the film made me reflect on how I never wavered from my style. I proudly can say that I stayed true to myself and how I wanted to put myself out there. Even when my single mom cringed and often scolded me for my spiked hair and rat tail c. 1985/86. Today, my classmates that made fun of me back then tell me I had the ""coolest haircut around"". These movies gave me courage and solace in who I was. I wish the actors, or ""Brat Pack"" (whoever they all are), would understand what a positive and profound impact they made on so many of our lives. A tiny bit of this came through at the end, but it wasn't the eventual, stark realization I hoped to hear. Perhaps now, actors like Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson could be likely comparisons. I love their talent as much as I did those I loved from the '80s. I've paid much more money to see their films than those from my HS years and I've not heard them complain at all. I think they understand the lives they've touched in a deeper way than what seems to be a shallow and selfish recall of this film. Maybe that is why some chose not to participate?

999621,No summary,"Either Andrew McCarthy has carried this level of resentment towards the Brat Pack magazine article for 40 years or chose to reopen a wound that should've closed many decades ago - neither option is healthy.The harsh truth is that most of the Brat Pack weren't very good actors. They were attractive and charismatic - but they were not good actors. That is the reason they faltered, along with the relatively short shelf life of the ""it"" actors of any moment throughout Hollywood history. The Brat Packers were destined to fade out of the spotlight and became regular working actors - no shame in that.Andrew McCarthy can blame the article for the trajectory his career took, and it is possible that it torpedoed his career before it took off - but doing Mannequin and two... TWO...Weekend at Bernies movies certainly didn't help. Wait, Andrew, you're saying Scorcese didn't want to put the star of Weekend at Bernies in Goodfellas?Some of the people most associated with the Brat Pack chose not to appear. This should've been a sign to Andrew that this was a doomed project. Instead we get an interview with Timothy Hutton who was never associated with the Brat Pack in any way. I think it just so happened that McCarthy was in upstate New York for another interview in the doc and snagged Hutton. Some other ""adjacent"" brats(Lea Thompson, Jon Cryer) fill in details along the edges.A lot of the interviews consist of Andrew McCarthy insisting it was traumatic. He continually tries to force that narrative. To be fair, most of the actors agree with him that it made their career paths confusing and uncertain AT THE TIME(the mid to late 80s), but they also seem to want to hint that ""Yeah, it wasn't great... but it's also been 40+years Andrew.""The article gets a lions share of blame for some of the short circuited careers of McCarthy, Ringwald, and Nelson - but that's not really accurate. Ringwald stepped away from Hollywood, probably to put some distance between herself and her awkward position as John Hughes' ""muse."" Judd Nelson never really had the disposition or the looks to be a top billed movie star, and as I mentioned McCarthy made terrible choices in scripts.None of the people in this documentary seem to acknowledge the very basic fact that you can't bring ten to fifteen new actors into Hollywood at the same time and expect everyone to succeed, there's only so many roles available - and math just didn't work out in Andrew McCarthy's favor.I know I went more into the circumstances behind the documentary instead of the doc itself. McCarthy directed the documentary, and that might be why it seems a little scattered and unfocused. He's not a neutral observer. The film features ""artistic"" angles for no reason, saturated footage, and bad framing. The interviews are more like therapy sessions than old acquaintances catching up. Overall, it's an OK documentary but it's a very thin premise that doesn't merit an hour and half of content.",4.0,mmartin64,2024-11-07,2.0,0.0

The documentary follows Andrew McCarthy as he interviews his fellow Brat Packers and sees if they are as infuriated-to-this-day by the phrase as he is.My initial reaction was, he's being ridiculous, but it was interesting to see this from the point of view of people who saw themselves as distinct actors who got lumped together in mockery because they were in a couple of movies together.It's interesting to see that they all have some thoughts on it, although the least bitter are the two biggest stars of the group, Rob Lowe and Demi Moore, who breezily dismiss any trauma from the comfort of their sunny mansions.One can't help but feel that the bitterest of the crew, like McCarthy and Estevez, may be blaming an article because they can't face the idea that they were just Hollywood flash-in-the-pans like thousands before them whose moment in the sun was brief. I mean, while only a couple held onto real stardom, they all seem to be doing fine.I generally liked the Brat Packers. Director McCarthy did a good job of showing himself slowly coming to terms with the coinage and seeing that a lot of his reaction had to do with his own insecurities. Ally Sheedy was likable and seemed like someone I would hang out with. Lowe was also likable, even though he always plays douches. Moore had a therapy-infused ""don't let your trauma define you"" vibe that suggested she would make an excellent guru.McCarthy also smartly brought in some Brat Pack analysts, including Malcolm Gladwell, to make it look a *little* less like navel gazing.I'm not sure this is worth watching if you haven't seen at least a couple of Brat Pack classics, but if you have, this is kind of fun.",7.0,cherold,2024-10-13,1.0,0.0

The movies these actors were in were all a really big deal when I was a teen and I hoped that this doc would be a great way to catch up with the group and get some insights into what it was like to be so immensely popular during that period.Instead, this film was a much-too-long and somewhat rambling dissertation about McCarthy's insecurities and his reasoning and blame-laying for why his career didn't go where he thought it should have.For the most part, the other actors in the doc appeared to be surprised that he was so affected by a single article from 40 years ago, and the overall theme was ""get over it, dude."" The group weren't friends once the movies wrapped and their disdain for the focus of this doc was evident. Anthony Michael Hall, Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson didn't even participate, which should give you some idea of how little they think of McCarthy.The culmination was an interview with David Blum (who coined the ""brat pack"" name) where McCarthy very clearly expected an apology. Thankfully, Blum didn't oblige. In fact, Blum reiterated what the other actors (most notably, Rob Lowe) had already told him. Get over it.In a nutshell, McCarthy was told that the article wasn't that important, that the ""Brat Pack"" name was immensely clever and brought many of these actors more fame than they night have achieved otherwise and on their own. What was implied was that McCarthy in particular was much more famous as a member of the brats than he would have been if he had relied solely on his own limited skills.But in spite of being told all this, it's clear that McCarthy didn't HEAR any of it.This doc was a litany of missed opportunities and a total disappointment.

The primary reason for this can be summed up in two words: Andrew McCarthy. His character is the epitome of a whine fest, dragging down every scene he's in with a tiresome, brooding performance that feels less like teenage disillusionment and more like an endless pity party.However, there are a couple of bright spots that almost make this film worth the watch. Rob Lowe and Demi Moore manage to rise above the dreariness with interviews that actually bring some life to the screen. Lowe's charm and charisma are undeniable, adding a needed spark to the group dynamic.

This documentary reveals the profound impact of a careless phrase on promising careers and personal lives, spotlighting Andrew McCarthy's quest for restitution and healing. McCarthy's journey underscores the deep wounds inflicted by the media's insatiable hunger for sensationalism.The film's raw honesty brings to light McCarthy's struggle with the ""Brat Pack"" label, which, in his own sensitive way, asserts that it derailed his career and overshadowed his talent. The other actors, though affected, distanced themselves from the group, revealing a painful disconnection. Their resilience contrasts with McCarthy's palpable hurt, highlighting how one ill-considered label can fracture friendships and futures.Ironically, the film is a poignant reminder of the decline of ethics in media. The journalist who coined the term lacked the integrity and empathy crucial to the profession, but he was certainly not the last of his kind. Was he the first? Yes, reporting should be about truth, not sensationalism but the media's reckless approach, turning young lives into collateral damage, prioritising a catchy story over human decency seems to have become a trend since the mid-eighties.""Brats"" is a powerful testament to the long-lasting scars of thoughtless, unconscionable, opportunist journalism.

While the intention to delve into the history and impact of the iconic 1980s group of young actors was promising, the execution left much to be desired. As someone who was a teenager during the Brat Pack era, I always viewed the group as a cool and positive influence. The documentary, however, seemed to focus on a more negative perspective that felt unnecessary and unbalanced.The only person who seemed genuinely invested in the documentary was Andrew McCarthy. His insights and reflections provided some depth, but the lack of engagement from other Brat Pack members was palpable. It felt as though McCarthy was the only one who truly cared about exploring the legacy of the Brat Pack, while others appeared indifferent. This lack of enthusiasm from key figures diminished the documentary's potential impact and made it feel one-sided.Furthermore, the documentary was plagued by repetition. Much of the information was reiterated multiple times, making it feel like the content could have been succinctly summarized in 30 minutes or less.

To me, the pack was the cast of The Breakfast Club, Demi Moore and Rob Lowe. Just because you were in a ""teen movie"" in the 80's doesn't make you a member of the group.I also found it somewhat telling that he had to try so hard to get people to appear in his project. Maybe it has to do more with him than with his view that they were all so traumatized and didn't want to relive those days.I think if this was more of a documentary about those days rather than some kind of personal journey about his failures, it would have been a whole lot more entertaining.",3.0,kkfmguy2-1,2024-07-11,4.0,4.0

999621,No summary,"After reading a number of reviews of this documentary, I was a little put-off in the idea of watching it. Many of the reviews seemed to think that Andrew was whining and holding on to his, mostly negative, emotions about the term ""Brat Pack"". Since I was a teenager at the time, and watched nearly all of the films with ""Brat Pack"" alumni in them, I decided to take a chance.I'm very glad I did!Yes, Andrew did have a number of misgivings about the term and that time of his career, but it became clear, early in the film, that he was really and mostly concerned with hearing from as many of the other 'pack members' (and adjacent members, or experts of pop culture) to find out once and for all, if indeed, his feelings were justified and shared.Well, what a delight to witness his journey just to find the 'others' and to see that, even though he had his feelings about that time, the others had similar feelings, or even better, different perspectives on those feelings, for which Andrew himself really seemed to delight in learning about.Like EVERY good story, to clearly see a character's development and 'arc' is what will make or break the 'telling'. In ""Brats"" we get to see Andrew's own transformation as he goes from interviews with: fellow actors of that time, to experts in the 'pop culture' phenom, and eventually the original news article journalist himself.Andrew seemed to bring the best of both worlds: jaded somewhat by the industry at large, but sincerely open- minded and very open-hearted.From: re-living large amounts of nostalgic video footage, hearing the amazing music of the period, to the journey of tracking people down all around the country, and Andrew's own 'arc' of discovery...this documentary left me feeling happy, informed and very very satisfied.It is a well put together piece in all respects and i have to say, ""much respect"" to Andrew for bringing this juicy-nugget to the screen.Brats have never seemed sweeter.",8.0,iamflower,2024-07-10,0.0,0.0

I don't even know where to begin with this. Andrew McCarthy really needs to move on with his life. It appears Demi Moore and Rob Lowe did, but then again, they had much more successful careers than McCarthy. The term ""Brat Pack"" was a play on the term ""Rat Pack,"" and it signified that these were young actors. That's it. Nothing more. Maybe the article in New York Magazine had it's nasty moments, but you know what? The vast, vast majority of people didn't read that article. Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall used the term, ""Black Pack"" around that time about themselves and their group. Is there going to be a documentary about how bad that was too?I just disagree with McCarthy's premise entirely, although I'm sure he's positive his interpretation is the correct one. And since I remember that era, and was around the same age, I'm very confident in how I view that period of time, rather than the spin and import he's is trying to put on it.The film gets a 4 from me only because it was interesting to see lots of the people from that era that I also grew up on.

999621,No summary,"BratsAndrew McCarthy, one of the original members of the media dubbed ""Brat Pack"" seeks out the other actors from that time period as a way of looking back at the 1980s series of movies that launched these young adults into superstardom.For those of us that lived through this era, these movies were coming of age films that were actually performed by actors that were of the age portrayed. This was something completely different than had been seen before. However, as young adults tend to do, parties and shenanigans ensued. In 1985, an article was written calling to attention this phenomenon, thus showing the public a bit behind the curtain.However, other than the interviews of the people involved, the film comes across as extremely whiny, ironically keeping the term ""Brat"" alive. Everyone knew that the films were fun and showed representation of people going through the same issues and life experiences as they were. With the new exposure, I believe these films wouldn't have been quite as successful. Almost every actor interviewed looked back fondly with the notable exceptions of Emilio Estevez and McCarthy himself.Producers and directors interviewed were pleased with the attention as well, and tried to remind McCarthy that the term wasn't negative. Nearly 40 years later, nostalgia for that era has inspired newer generations to go back to that time to enjoy the amazing music, the feelings of growing up in a less than ideal world, and sometimes the silliness of the plots. There is some talk of the lack of diversity in the actors, but it is glossed over a bit too much for my liking. Even one of the black film critics spoke of relating to the characters because they were used to only seeing white people cast in these successful movies.While not mentioned in the movie, the success of the documentary seems to have led to a reunion of the principal actors of St. Elmo's Fire for a sequel, which leads me to question that McCarthy's whininess is even more pathetic.",5.0,malmevik77,2024-07-04,6.0,3.0

Interestingly, no one in the gang, (most of whom haven't seen him for 30+ years) agrees. They nod and look sympathetic as he carries on about how it kept his star from rising, but then say it was a moment in time. They didn't like it then, but they have all moved on.

999621,No summary,"The idea was interesting. But the documentary sometimes took itself too seriously, and sometimes was too flippant. It could be overly harsh and other times too forgiving. It would have been good to hear how lives were specifically changed, but instead talked around what happened so no one would be labeled as bitter or brooding.One poignant point was how movies had changed in the early/mid 80s to be youth oriented with movies about teenagers and played by younger actors. It created a swelling of new, young stars never seen to that degree before or since.The focus was on a hit piece article by an envious reporter that labeled them ""the brat pack."" It was supposed to be article on what it was like hanging out with Emilio Estavez for a few days before it was morphed into a scathing denunciation of an entire group. The article was pretty sloppy in its writing and tried to tar and feather as many people as possible, including Nicholas Cage and Tom Cruise.It changed the lives of all the actors. They stopped talking to each or seeing each other to distance themselves from the insinuation. But the damage was done. The label went ""viral"" before that was a term and for a group that was already getting older and would be looking for more adult roles, many found a wall they didn't expect and didn't know how to overcome.Many of the actors most deeply immersed in the time weren't interviewed. Some in the documentary were barely on the outskirts. And again what was truly missing was the nitty gritty of how it impacted rather than hearing again and again versions of wow, that was really something and quite an experience.

999621,No summary,"Andrew McCarthy's doc is half-nostalgia, half-therapy session. McCarthy has never gotten over being tagged as a member of the Brat Pack, and blames that label as the primary reason his career stalled. McCarthy sets out to interview the other acknowledged Pack members and see how they have been doing the past three and a half decades and if they similarly feel stung by the moniker (he notes that he hasn't been in contact with many of them over those many years).It's a strange, not to mention, awkward, set-up, but it has interest for anybody interested in 80s mainstream cinema. One of the issues that McCarthy has to address is exactly who qualifies as a full Brat Pack member? The original magazine article by David Blum is focused really on only three: Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe and Judd Nelson . Ironically, McCarthy himself is only mentioned once. Assumed Brat Packers Ally Sheedy and Molly Ringwald aren't mentioned at all, and Demi Moore is simply cited as a girlfriend. McCarthy stretches the circle and interviews Jon Cryer, Timothy Hutton and Lea Thompson. Two members of the Pack don't give on camera interviews although McCarthy acknowledges that they at least called him back. What becomes clear is that the term never really had any meaning save for an easy catch-all for the media and the Hollywood publicity machine to exploit.Perhaps not surprisingly, the interviews aren't too challenging and the other actors seem to have put it all behind them more than McCarthy himself. Usually, Much more so. Sheedy and Moore are the warmest to his plight and he's visibly moved by their words. Other interviewees include Producer Lauren Shuler Donner, Agent Loree Rodin and Director Howard Deutch who give first person accounts of how they handled the hoopla and the actors themselves. Some of the best footage come from Authors Brett Easton Ellis and Malcolm Gladwell who put the era in context.The grand finale as where McCarthy confronts head to head the movie's boogeyman - Blum. To his credit, the author doesn't back down from his word; instead, he tries to put it all in context, including the fact that he was only a few years older than his subjects at the time - he wasn't some middle-aged fuddy-duddy wagging his finger at youths.BRATS isn't a full success. It does go on a bit, and some of McCarthy's directing touches are more distracting than interesting. While it's only 92 minutes in length, one does feel that it devolves into self-pity more than once (McCarthy has also written a book on the subject - I guess that didn't sufficiently get it out of his system).

I wouldn't go so far as to say they were integral to my adolescents, but they were like ""the anthem"" or ""soundtrack"" so to speak. These movies were nothing like my life, but there was an essence that a lot of teens could relate to. It felt aspirational and unattainable all at the same time. The actors themselves seemed glamorous and cool. I didn't give much thought to the ""Brat Pack"" moniker at the time, though looking back I can see how the negative connotation of the word ""brat"" lent me towards a negative perception of them as people, which just show the power of the written word. I still liked them, I still watched movies they did, but a pal had descended and they became the typical ""entitled, shallow, hedonistic"" Hollywood types. Whether this was deserved or not, I can appreciate how their careers were negatively impacted going forward. It was a shame the author of the ""Brat Pack"" label showed so little introspection and said a couple of times he was still proud of the story. I'm sure some of this is bravado and arrogance, and maybe a little bit not wanting to face the depth of hurt he caused in his own bid to be clever and noticed. One of the women in the documentary said how the author of the article was clearly jealous of Emilio and Rob, and the others by association. That truth was cemented when the author pointed out how much attention they were getting the night he did the interview and he wasn't getting any. The folly of youth can be a dangerous thing. While watching this you get the feeling you are sitting in on a group therapy session. Some of the people are directly impacted by the ""trauma"" and the others are the ""witnesses"" who hold up the mirror of the past with an impartial lens. It is interesting the people who participated in the documentary and those who choose not to. They all have their reason. For some it's better to keep the past in the past and for others it is cathartic to talk about it. It was interesting the positive spin Rob Lowe put on it. Demi offered a wise perspective, as did others. The article was sort of like the cancel culture of today. If you allow the negative to define you, it can crush you, but if you can rise above and basically give the finger and say ""hell no you don't get the last word to define me"" the negative can turn in to a positive. I thought this was a well produced documentary and I hope it accomplished what it set out to do and enable the demons of the past to stop haunting and get buried.

I was honestly surprised by how hard the actors involved took the Brat Pack label because I never really thought about the label as a negative until now. I just thought of it as a play on words from the Rat Pack (who were the coolest of the cool) and the label being changed to ""Brat"" because of the youth of the actors involved. I didn't ever consider it as calling them bratty in their real lives. I truly just thought it referred to this group as the NEW ""coolest of the cool,"" but younger. I also never read the article or knew of it's existence. Now that I know the whole backstory, I can definitely see why the actors in the group they felt that the Brat Pack label diminished the perception of their work ethic and their seriousness about their craft. Especially considering the tender age they were when all this happened, I now understand why it was so devastating for them. I just hope they realize that for those of us who loved their movies, the Brat Pack label didn't diminish them in the least.I hate it that one schmuck took the careers of half a dozen talented young people and completely changed the trajectory of those careers and of the actors' lives. For these young actors, David Blum essentially took away their innocence.I thought what Demi Moore said towards the end was profound - the Brat Pack label and the mean-spirited article weren't really about her and her fellow actors, but more about who the writer was as a person. And apparently, who he still is. I would have expected that, knowing how harmful the fallout from that article was for that group of performers, David Blum would have been extremely remorseful. Nope. He torpedoed the lives of a bunch of very young, innocent people who he barely knew, and seems to this day, to be perfectly okay with that. Someone who had evolved and matured as most people would have over the course of 30+ years would have said something about thinking it was a good idea at the time, but later regretting the damage he'd inflicted. Not David Blum. In his interview with Andrew McCarthy, he comes off as insanely arrogant, self-absorbed, and oblivious to/dismissive of the pain he caused and to the resulting scattering of those considered part of the Brat Pack. Because truly, those actors were magic as an ensemble and they almost never worked together again. It probably also limited the other roles available to the Brat Pack members, roles in projects that had no connection to the other actors in the group. Who knows what the world, and the actors targeted by the label, missed out on because of one reporter's hubris and utter lack of compassion or integrity. I'm just grateful we got the Hollywood magic we did before it all blew up and I wish all the Brat Packers the very best. I always get a kick out of seeing any of them pop up in more recent projects. It's like running into old friends. Speaking of old friends, I do hope that Andrew McCarthy's film has reconnected the group. They seemed genuinely fond of one another and it's a shame they've had to spend the last 30+ years avoiding each other.

999621,No summary,"I watched this mostly because I love 1980s pop culture, the music, the movies, the TV shows, and yes the irreverent reviewers who lambasted Hollywood's best and brightest with snarky nicknames like The Brat Pack. I always thought that term was funny and a tongue in cheek compliment to the young actors. It sums up a lot of mixed feelings about these ""kids,"" mainly that some of their movies were really pretentious crap and they took themselves way too seriously but you know what? We still loved them!Apparently writer, director and self-proclaimed moral compass and star of this documentary Andrew McCarthy didn't get the message. I can understand that he may have had his feelings hurt 40 years ago but grow up already! The rest of the Pack moved on and turned out to be funny, kind and talented human beings. McCarthy puts on full display his incredible pettiness and jealousy. He blames everyone else for what he considers to be a career that never reached its full potential. Now he seeks vengeance against those who dared to poke fun at him a lifetime ago.It is telling that a number of actors declined to participate in McCarthy's pity party including arguably the two best Brat actors, Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson. They simply refused to dwell on ancient slights and injured feelings. Anthony Michael Hall also refused an invitation to participate saying he never paid attention to critics, pop culture, or who got their feelings hurt. He was and is far too busy to take any of it seriously.Andrew McCarthy has proven himself to be the worst kind of creative artist. One who blames others for his own shortcomings and who will one day inevitably pass on to the next world a bitter old man with few if any friends, probably throwing rocks at the neighbors' children.",2.0,martinrandall-36706,2024-06-24,6.0,3.0

I felt that a documentary was long overdue and I was expecting so much from it and was left feeling dumbfounded and bitter. It is really hard for me to write this review and criticize Andrew McCarthy, as he was always my favourite 80's Brat pack movie actor. Yet after watching this documentary I was left feeling he is a whiny, ungrateful, bitter man. The looks on the faces of Emilio and Ally really said it all. I think none of them could really understand why McCarthy was so bitter. Having been around during this time, I was well aware of the 'Brat' packs behaviour, their partying, drug taking etc. They really didn't need an article to secure their position in that title. I understand that McCarthy saw greater things for his career and he felt that the article damaged what could have been. But the simple fact is that it didn't really damage anyone else's career, and I feel perhaps it was too easy for McCarthy to use it as an excuse rather than to actually get out there. At first I was disappointed that Molly and Judd declined to be involved, but after watching it, I can't blame them. Shame on you McCarthy.

It's just kind of sad that the positive pop culture impact of a catch all for these popular movies and characters had to be explained to him by Demi Moore and Rob Lowe. His negative perceptions and self esteem issues then and now allowed him to hurt his own career and it's sad the end of the doc doesn't get him realising that.So yes, it's a long and boring therapy session that doesn't even help the patient.

999621,No summary,"I graduated from high school in 1985, so I grew up in the middle of the Brat Pack glory days. Loved the films, and the documentary certainly brought back some great memories. But McCarthy seems a bit too self-indulgent as he investigates what it meant to his and the others' careers to be labeled as they were. The article that spawned the nickname was, indeed, abrasive and written by someone obviously jealous of the success of these young actors. It wasn't entirely wrong, either. But there wasn't anything wrong with being jubilantly young, successful, talented, and rich - especially in the mid-80s. The original article reads like sour grapes. But I stood in line for these movies and to this day enjoy rewatching St Elmo's Fire and Weird Science, among others, on occasion. I was looking forward to this documentary, and came away slightly disappointed. If the ""Brat Pack"" label so adversely affected the careers of these actors then the rest of the world didn't know or care. The documentary comes off as excessive navel gazing on McCarthy's part, and he may have by the end realized he'd spent entirely too much of his life resenting being categorized as he and the others were. Meh. Perhaps some decent counseling would have helped him considerably. It's unfortunate that Molly ringwald and Judd Nelson refused to take part, but I understand their reticence to be involved. It's a decent enough retrospective and sure to bring back memories to those of us who grew up in the '80s. But be patient with all the overthinking.",4.0,ranwulfs,2024-06-23,3.0,3.0
999621,No summary,"Brats is a bit of a weird documentary. Not subject-wise--everyone knows the Brat Pack of young actors from the 1980s and this is as good a time as any to give them another look-over. No, this doc is strange because its primary goal isn't the main draw here--rather the musings director Andrew McCarthy makes along the way.For a very basic overview, the premise of this doc is McCarthy--a Brat Pack member himself--telling the story of how that label (from a 1985 magazine article penned by David Blum) really damaged him emotionally at that time and somewhat still haunts him to this very day. As such, he goes on a quest to track down the Brat Pack members--as well as Blum--in interviews to gather further thoughts.Like I mentioned, these primary goals don't always work the way they should. McCarthy shows somewhat of a lack of understanding of what the Brat Pack label really meant, he can't reach all the old gang, and he doesn't necessarily get the absolution from Blum he anticipated.But all that didn't bother me as much as it may have others. Why? Two reasons:1. It is just so much fun (and so nostalgic) to see the likes of Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Jon Cryer, Lea Thompson, Timothy Hutton, Demi Moore, and Rob Lowe again and catch up on their present selves. Whether bona fide ""Brats"" or more ""Brat-adjacent"", they each bring an interesting opinion to the table.2. The overall musings on how 1980s cinema saw the meteoric rise of cinema for teenagers (which is now perhaps the key demographic to the whole business). Before that, young people were not the target audience for most movies--but the Brat Pack had an enormous role in changing that and skewing Hollywood younger than at any previous period.So, even though the main premise of Brats didn't quite live up to its billing, I found it interesting and engaging enough in other ways to really enjoy it. A must-watch for anyone who remembers these films/actors or even has a passing interest in such material.",10.0,zkonedog,2024-06-23,3.0,3.0

This was before the internet so an article in New York Magazine wasn't read nationwide. The name stuck as it was easy to remember because it plagiarized the other pack. The article (I just read it for the first time a minute ago) is total crap and if it weren't for the name he coined, no one would have ever spoken of those few thousand words again. It was nothing more or less than a hatchet job by a journalist who probably wanted to sleep with one of them.It's ironic that the one I despised the most in this group as an actor and the one with the most punchable face, Andrew McCarthy, has had an interesting career lately as a travel writer and now this film. I haven't read anything he's written so I'm beginning with his memoir of walking the Camino de Santiago with his son.Nothing much of anything is revealed in this film. Once upon a time there was an article written that coined the name. The supposed members of this Brat Pack, young actors, made a bunch of films dealing with young people. There was never much to this story and thus not much more can be said about it all these years later.The film itself is awkward at times with way too much time inside of a car, too many shots of the film crew lurking around in the background, and there wasn't much at all of what their lives were like 40 years ago.The strangest thing I learned from the film was that none of them were even friends and haven't had any contact with each other in all these years. It just seems like they'd at least call once in a while to comment on a recent project they had finished, either to compliment each other or ask if they knew about it.

Now that she's passed, I've moved the yearly viewings to either the night before thanksgiving or after the Thanksgiving day parade. And i feel like i'm writing a love letter directly to him here because as a filmmaker I assume he'll read this review. Anyhow, his films were indelible when growing up so much so when i go hiking or listen to music it's usually from the soundtrack of one of these two films. Don't get me wrong i also loved ""Less than Zero"", and ""Sixteen Candles"". ""Brats"" was definitely a therapeutic Generation X reunion not only for Andrew but for us to revisit our favorite film stars from the era to see where they are now. I'll start with Andrew. It was nice to see him. The whole Brat pack things i heard about it, but was unaware of what it truly meant and how affecting it was to Andrew and the other actors. I blame David Blum! Word have consequences! Sometimes good sometimes not. The way i see it publicity can be a two edge sword. Publicity is good to have it to promote your films, but if it's not good it can be detrimental. Here in ""Brats"" it seems like it was affecting enough to engage Andrew to make a documentary which is no easy feat. The resources, time and dedication it takes to make begs for a level of commitment that surpasses just regular interest. It can be years of work. But to my delight I'm grateful he did because it was like going back to St. Elmo's fire. I felt like i was watching a two hour behind the scenes of ""where are they now"" and i did not want it to end. I only wish he would have brought everyone together in one room specially since they have not seen each other for so long. But as a fan of his films and the cast of St. Elmo's Fire this documentary was such a treat. I for one am very happy Andrew decided to take on the task of making this doc. I wish now it would come out on DVD so i can add it to my collection because i joined Hulu just to watch this. Let's talk about the music.... fantastic!!! Andrew did fantastic in taking clips from the film and soundtracks from the film from master genius David Foster - and other 80's popular ""Forever Young"" (as for David Foster, anything this man creates is gold) and i listen to his music religiously. He's composed some of the most memorable 80's music that i listen to almost everyday from the 80's until now. And his track are in my all time favorites ""St. Elmo's Fire"". ""The Secret of My Success"", ""Two of a Kind"" i could go on and on. So do i recommend this documentary?. ABSOLUTELY!!!! Specially if you are from Generation X.

999621,No summary,"I'm of the same generation as the members of the Brat Pack, but I have to admit my takeaway from Andrew McCarthy's 2024 documentary was mostly indifference. The film amounts to the actor's personal odyssey in examining the impact of the media's Brat Pack designation back in 1985 on him and his close-knit colleagues, almost all of them in their early 20's. Nearly four decades later, McCarthy, now 61, uses a first-person narrative to track down his fellow Brat Packers as well as Brat Pack-adjacent actors like Lea Thompson and Timothy Hutton and even David Blum, the magazine journalist who wrote the puff piece that introduced the term. Despite his genuine efforts toward personal revelation, McCarthy often comes across as self-entitled and obsessed with the ""brat"" moniker all these years later. His fellow sixtyish Brat Packers appear downright sanguine compared to him (Ally Sheedy, a poker-faced Emilio Estevez, a chill Rob Lowe, and a post-therapy Demi Moore), and Blum is understandably unapologetic about his role in hurting the feelings of a group of celebrities who are clearly not hurting financially.",4.0,EUyeshima,2024-06-18,28.0,5.0

999621,No summary,"During the 1980s, several top grossing movies featured an ensemble of actors in their early twenties-often portraying teens-who became known as the ""Brat Pack"". Significantly, several of these movies, with their overlapping casts, were written and/or directed by John Hughes: especially ""Sixteen Candles"" (1984), ""The Breakfast Club"" (1985), and ""Pretty in Pink"" (1986). All three of these starred Molly Ringwald, who was at the true center of the ""Brat Pack"" phenomenon, although the term was coined by writer David Blum in a 1985 interview with Emilio Estevez. Blum applied the term to the cast of ""St. Elmo's Fire"" (1985) in which Ringwald did not appear, but the cast did include Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Demi Moore, Judd Nelson, Andrew McCarthy, and Rob Lowe. Besides Ringwald, the only other core Brat Packer missing from ""St. Elmo's Fire"" was Anthony Michael Hall, who did appear in ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""The Breakfast Club"".Andrew McCarthy, in his documentary ""Brats"" explores-socially, psychologically, and professionally-what it has meant to be a member of the Brat Pack. The initial reaction to the 1985 ""New York Magazine"" article that labelled them was varying shades of negative. McCarthy, for example, felt that his talent as an actor was being dismissed. The term ""brat"" seemed to imply that the members of the ensemble were spoiled children.Although not everyone reacted as strongly as McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, the focus of the article, did feel particularly insulted by it. He resisted making any more movies with fellow Brat Packers so as not to call further attention to the association. For example, a proposed movie about the behind-the-scenes wheeling and dealing that spawned the famous 1969 Woodstock Music and Art Festival, which would have starred Estevez and McCarthy, fell through when Estevez backed out.With the exception of Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson, McCarthy manages to interview all of the principal Brat Packers as well as others who are willing to share their insights about the phenomenon surrounding the label. Contributors range from social critic Malcolm Gladwell to self-described ""Brat-Pack adjacent"" actress Lea Thompson. Jon Cryer, on the other hand, looks straight into the camera and flatly denies that he was ever a member of the pack. (Then why is he in the documentary?)McCarthy, who conducts the interviews-which are more conversations-clearly finds the process therapeutic. Being labelled a member of the Brat Pack was something that neither he nor others in the group talked about for decades, but finally airing the hurt feelings has put the phenomenon in perspective. McCarthy even has a meeting with Blum who admits that while he never meant to hurt anyone, he did expect the snarky sensationalism of his coinage to have a more meteoric effect on his career than it actually did.Particularly touching are McCarthy's reunions with Estevez and Sheedy. They are able to renew their friendships as the decades apart seem to melt away. McCarthy admits to having had a crush on Sheedy back in 1985, and he reminisces about the two of them riding through Los Angeles in her vehicle after a day on a movie set, and he remembers thinking how happy and lucky he felt to be living his dream, and to be such good friends with his co-stars.How unique was the decade that produced the so-called Brat Pack? Arguably, in the U. S., there was no equivalent in the 1960s and 1970s in terms of actors who came of age in hit movies. Television series produced stars like, Patty Duke, Sally Field, and Christopher Jones, but only Duke and Field became stars on the big screen (and it did not last as long for Duke). There was a youth culture at that time, but while it manifested in music, it did not translate so readily to cinema, possibly because the industry, especially in the U. S., was too conservative and dominated by dinosaurs at its highest echelons.The British were more successful at putting youth on the big screen with movies like ""If..."" (1968) starring Malcolm McDowell and ""Blow-Up"" (1966) starring David Hemmings and Vanessa Redgrave. But from the State-side perspective, it was the British who got labelled the most back then: Redgrave, along with Michael Caine, Julie Christie, and Terence Stamp were considered to be a cinematic ""British Invasion"" in the 1960s, somewhat parallel to the musical invasion of the Beatles and Rolling Stones. There was even a parallel ""Brit Pack"" in the 1980s, consisting of the likes of Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, and Daniel Day-Lewis. And there was an Australian Invasion in the 1970s-80s featuring Mel Gibson, Judy Davis, and Sam Neill.The closest to the Brat Pack effect (or the John Hughes effect) in the U. S. during the 1960s might have been the work of director Frank Perry, who sandwiched youth-oriented dramas in between films about adults. In 1962, he made ""David and Lisa"" with Keir Dullea and Janet Margolin, but stardom eluded them both for the most part, despite Dullea's memorable role in ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Perry also made ""Last Summer"" (1969) with Barbara Hershey, Richard Thomas, and Bruce Davison. (Barbara Hershey might well be compared to Ally Sheedy in terms of dark beauty combined with impeccable acting chops.) Richard Thomas, of course, became a star, but unlike Hershey, his success was primarily on television.The Brat Pack does seem to have been unique, after all, and not only because its moniker had embarrassing connotations. As McCarthy realizes in the course of making this documentary, the negative ramifications of the term were most harmful only insofar as he let them be.",8.0,Miles-10,2024-06-16,0.0,0.0

Although there's a good percentage of older types that are currently displaying their issues front-and-center, so maybe not, maybe it's this narcissistic need due to social media to always feel 'seen' all the time?Anyway, this feel very phony, forced and like Andy needed to be 'seen' again; the 'brat pack' moniker stuck because they acted liked brats. Like they felt they were so cute and edgy and fabulous, and what most of us back then already knew from our parents- don't get too big for your britches because you never know when you won't be able to pull your pants up.I will say a few of the interviews had some interesting things- Ally (who looks fabulous by the way) seems so real and authentic, Demi still seems to be so far up her own behind (seriously, do she and Courtney Cox have the same surgeon?), Rob really turned himself around (what I heard was, it was due to his wife/having a family), Emilio seems like I would have imagined. A lot of people don't realize but I always think of RDJ in the same ethos as all of these people, (same age and did flicks with the members, like Less Than Zero with Andy) but his demons ran so deep that he was above these guys in antics and it always seems like he was sort of deserted by this group. I am beyond happy for his success, he thoroughly deserves only good things. Jud is still the image of cool, so is James Spader.Andrew still seems the same- his interviews in the 80s/90s were always so giggly/desperate/needy, and he's still there doing the same thing. Apparently he's a somewhat known director, but obviously that's not enough and the moniker that has stuck like super glue in the Sun sticks directly to his soul.I always advised my children to lean into the negative that sinks into your skin and see what it is that bothers you so much; try looking in and fight the urge to look out.I was born in '66, so there's a good bit of these films that are a memorable part of youth- Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, etc., but I have always found St Elmo's Fire to be a bit pretentious and a lot boring.To summarize- I didn't feel like there was anything learned here worthwhile.

999621,No summary,"Engaging documentary from actor Andrew McCarthy on the participants in the popular teen movies of the 1980s--actors who are now pushing 60--and how the label ""Brat Pack"" (taken from the headline in a 1985 New York Magazine article by David Blum, who is interviewed) was possibly a brand, a stigma, a curse, or maybe something special, something that other actors of the time aspired to be a part of. McCarthy, once a pseudo-self-conscious, aloof and somewhat constipated young movie star, took the inspiration for this project from his autobiography, ""Brat: An '80s Story""; his feeling for the past 30 years that the term ""Brat Pack"" was a scathing slap at a certain group of young Hollywood talent circa 1985 isn't unjustified, but his personal wounds--and the sometimes mixed feelings of his contemporaries--are put into perspective here in quickie-therapeutic fashion (aided in its presentation by a bevy of vintage TV clips and interviews). One of the first questions posed is: who was actually in the Brat Pack? I always felt it pertained to select members of the cast of 1985's ""St. Elmo's Fire"" (not everyone, of course; there's no mention of Mare Winningham, for instance). There's also some suspense in McCarthy's rounding up of interviewees, particularly reluctant stars Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson (both of whom decline the invitation). ""Brats"" isn't investigative journalism; McCarthy is out to heal personal and professional wounds, and he wants perspective in his journey from Emilio Estevez, Demi Moore, Rob Lowe, Jon Cryer, Ally Sheedy, Lea Thompson, Timothy Hutton, writers, producers and directors. McCarthy insists he is not sentimental and he is not nostalgic--but ""we"" are, and the general catharsis is almost real. **1/2 from ****",6.0,moonspinner55,2024-06-16,9.0,1.0
999621,No summary,"First and foremost 'Brats' shows that young actors in Hollywood are vulnerable. Andrew McCarthy tells us that the term 'Brat Pack' had a big impact on some of the young artists' minds, who were part of this pack. Understandbly as a young person you want to be taken seriously and when a journalist from a renowned newspaper all of a sudden calls you a brat, this can be hurtful and even traumatic for young sensitive artists. The art of an actor is to be sensitive so they can transcribe thoughts, feelings and emotions via their whole being, onto the screen or onto a stage. I very much also understand the journalist being proud of himself with this genius terminology 'Brat Pack'. Where it went wrong was with the guidance from agents and production companies who should have helped these young professionals. It is probably one of the sides of Hollywood that is being ignored: the lack of guidance, the lack of help to understand and define everything that is happening around them and to help them explain and help them to deal with all the turmoil that comes with becoming famous and successful in Hollywood. It sounds to me that the young actors were left tending to themselves on how to deal with all of this. So it is not where the journalist went wrong, but where the whole Hollywood industry failed them. Hollywood as an industry failed them, it failed to be there for their money making actors. Especially when teenagers and young adults are involved. But also when people are adults and experience a sudden succes and fame in Hollywood, there should be good professional help and guidance for a long period of time. I think it would prevent many addictions, many depressions and many stressful, negative feelings. I think this is a subject that should have been talked about, in this documentary. But it shows that even now, as middle aged people, these actors still need to figure out for themselves how to deal with these kinds of phenomenons. So, of course they should have been proud being called the Brat Pack. All of a sudden they were put on the same pedestal as the original Rat Pack. The journalist could have called them Rat Pack 2.0.. But let's face it: Brat Pack is a much better, literary title. It is a badge of honour. And of course they were seen as Brats, when all of a sudden these young actors are making money as never seen before in Hollywood, looking at young actors. And the older generation probably would have also called them Brats, out of jealousy and spite. But when you're in your early 20's without lots of life experience, this could prove to be too difficult to put into context. But everyone around the world wanted to be a Brat like them, have succes like them, be charismatic and communicatively able like them and yes to party like them and be respected like them. Because let's face it: being given such a huge badge of honour, being called the Brat Pack in direct reference to the influential Rat Pack, is a testimony to the succes and influence of these young people right there and then in the 1980's. It is a sign of huge respect, there just weren't professionals around these young people to explain this to them.",7.0,andredejongh,2024-06-15,6.0,1.0

Is he well?I just read a review from North Shore Movies. Here is an excerpt:
""Indeed, re-reading the piece after watching the movie, it's amusing to note that McCarthy is barely mentioned in it at all. Ranking the Brat Pack members beneath unofficial ""President"" Estevez, Blum lists Cruise, Rob Lowe, Judd Nelson, Timothy Hutton, Matt Dillion, Nicolas Cage and Sean Penn, while making no note of McCarthy until the fifth-to-last paragraph of the muti-page piece. The article itself is mostly a chronicle of callow young Hollywood kids trying to pick up chicks and being too naïve to know they shouldn't be behaving like drunken bozos in front of a journalist. A saucy read, but hardly career-ending stuff.""In other words, Andrew McCarthy's apparent ramblings that the article hampered him, if not downright ruined his career, borders on delusional considering the success of all the others given more attention in the article.Relax Andrew.

It made me wonder how someone might look at me forty years later (although, throughout the documentary, Andrew constantly claimed today was ""thirty years later""). Yet, the sight of Andrew McCarthy so many years later was still familiar to me, and, in some ways, nostalgic. I became engrossed by the sight of him - his age (and mine-ish) was fond for me to see.As Andrew McCarthy traveled the U. S. highways to revisit those of his (or ""our"" - well, at least ""my"") youth, he had the nerve to ask others of his successful era how they felt about being typified as a member of the ""Brat Pack"". He filmed their honest responses, and he let us view his own ""take"" on the label; how it might've affected him and all their lives.""Brats"" justly depicts the era it represents. And, corny as it may sound, this film offers how different perspectives from many others can have a lasting impact on one's self.As I'm all better from my bed-ridden situation, I unquestionably rate this film 10 stars.

Its more of story about how one of the Brat Pack responded negatively to the name. So much so that he felt it soured his later career and that of the other members. We unfortunately never get to find out who, because they don't agree to being interviewed. But its clear that some of the members didn't think that much of it or actually viewed it positively. Which underlines the fact that The Brat Pack was simply a lazy construct which didn't really exist. Interestingly the author of the story is actually confronted about the scathing story which went with the trashy title. I won't spoil it for you how that ends.I noticed a few reviews claiming this was a good nostalgia trip, it isn't really because if anything it pulls apart the myth surrounding the Brat Pack narrative. Its also a reminder that many of these journalists who wielded the power to build and destroy career with their pens, no longer have this power. And they are salty about it.

999621,No summary,"I was very excited for this, as I grew up in the 80s and saw all the movies with the Brat Pack multiple times. Unfortunately this was a big let down. I never thought the nickname, ""Brat Pack"" carried any negativity. In fact, I thought it was pretty cool and seemed aspirational. To hear McCarthy and some of the other members of the clique lament the designation was surprising, depressing, and also a little eye-roll worthy. I don't like discounting other people's feelings, but the sentiments expressed here did feel a bit, ""poor little rich girl."" If the article about these young actors had somehow destroyed their careers, and they were living destitute and damaged, this documentary would have carried more weight. However, the fact that they have all continued working in all areas of entertainment and enjoyed sane and successful lives makes the supposed wounds left by the article seem more like over exaggerated paper cuts rather than a career killer. The absence of Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson also made the documentary feel kind of lame and incomplete. The two of them regularly do reunion interviews together for ""The Breakfast Club,"" so it's not like they are opposed to looking back on that time. Even if they had participated and that noticeable hole didn't exist, there were too many other holes needing patching that couldn't keep this boat successfully afloat.",4.0,JonnyDR75,2024-06-14,10.0,6.0
999621,No summary,"In terms of technical aspects, this documentary film can feel unpolished and inconsistent at times. The editor of this documentary struggled with the footage they received. The responsibility for that lies with Director Andrew McCarthy. Despite that, the music and video footage from the 1980s carry a deep sense of nostalgia for people from Generation X, just like me. Watching and reliving the past with my favorite actors and actresses from the golden age of the Brat Pack was an enjoyable experience. In all honesty, this documentary delves into the phenomenon of Generation X teenagers and young adults idolizing a group of actors and actresses known as the ""Brat Pack,"" as highlighted in a New York magazine article written by David Blum. It has always been evident to me that this brand pays homage to the ""Rat Pack"" celebrity group, with Frank Sinatra serving as its designated president. Andrew McCarthy only understood the concept of this parity after it was explained to him by multiple figures in the Hollywood industry, including producers, film critics, writers, journalists, and book authors, from the 1980s. The term ""Brat Pack"" is a puberty and marriage rite of passage for Generation Xers. Between 1978 and 2000, a significant number of young adults in America, including myself, transitioned from a teenager into parenthood and became parents to the Millennial and Generation Z children. We were in high school when the Brat Pack rose to fame, then we entered college and coincided in age with the Brat Pack, and eventually got married just like the actors and actresses in the Brat Pack. As mentioned by Ally Sheedy and the other participants in this documentary, we all found a connection with the characters depicted in John Hughes' film scripts. Andrew poses the question to a few Brat Pack members, asking if they would switch their nominations in this celebrity status group, and a few of them are uncertain about what choice to make. Why? Because the ""Brat Pack"" label turned them into legends in the Hollywood industry, ensuring their amazing legacy for years to come.",8.0,JerryrFlanagan,2024-06-14,4.0,1.0

Pretty funny actually in his exchange with Emilio, Andrew actually kind of got loud and tried to justify why he had been hurt by it, almost like he needed Emilio to agree with him...it was very weird. This was a missed opportunity to look back at this group and reflect on the crazy cool times of it. He spoke with people and gave them a lot of time on film that I didn't know, and had no interest in. Ally Sheedy, Rob Lowe, Demi, and Emilio talked with him.

I never once thought that that title belittled them and apparently some of the actors and their directors didn't either. The term ""Brat Pack"" was simply a catchy phrase that included all the up and coming young actors and actresses that were storming theater screens in America (much like the Rat Pack from the 50's and 60's). Granted, they might not have liked being given the nickname, but many of them looked beyond it and continued on. Andrew seems to be the only one that is still carrying this deep seeded agony about the title, and that's pretty much all this documentary is...interviews with his fellow pack members where he seemed to think that they'd all side with him in demonizing this name and the author that penned it.If you expect to see some great nostalgia from the 80's movies and the actors, don't bother watching this.",2.0,stsorrell,2024-06-14,11.0,6.0

I feel it can across as McCarthy whining about something that happened 30+ years ago, and was perceived by him as something not entirely as he was interpreting. When that article and label first came out I saw the term Brat Pack as primarily a play on the label Rat Pack to make the comparison and contrast with the coming of a different era and generation in Hollywood. I feels as though Andrew McCarthy is loading blame on to one article for his lack of success or more success in his chosen career. Instead maybe he should look more at his selection of roles and his acting abilities. If he would have leaned into the term things would likely have been different. Another thing that comes through is that there is probably a reason, of all the young actors in Hollywood at the time, including many who appeared in movies alongside them, that this group received that label and that they may have perceived it in a negative light. Look at the publicity they received for some very bad behavior at times. Maybe they were acting like entitled brats more than most, I don't know, just speculation.

So THIS part of the documentary wears on you.For us on the outside, it was a bonus for them. It kept them relevant. It kept them working, at least for a decade. And NO ONE I knew considered ""Brat Pack"" a negative moniker. And we were movie people. Brat Pack to us was of course a reference to Rat Pack which was positive. Brat was certainly not taken to mean Brat but just a term that meant Young (and rhymes with Rat).

I was highly interested in watching this documentary having grown up smack dab in the middle of that era.#classof85 🤘I HIGHLY recommend to all fellow classmates who wish to immediately take a nostalgic and familiar trip down memory lane :)
As I was watching, I realized that this was not only their story but ours. They set the tone for that ERA, and we embraced every freaking moment of it! For the first time, Hollywood was invested in our journey. Our generation. They were relatable and highly entertaining. We actually had a voice.I remember watching their movies, St Elmo's Fire and ESPECIALLY The Breakfast Club, to name a couple. I can probably quote the latter ver batim and I am dang proud of that! ;) #lovemesomebender #screwsfalloutallthetimetheworldsanimperfectplace
It might seem silly or cheesy to some, but to us it was a revolution! A cultural phenomenon!They were our peers, our dysfunctional role models, our 'heroes'. Even though they struggled with the title, I wonder if they actually understand the impact they had on our young lives? This was pre-social media, a different era, a different mindset albeit, a much better one.The youth of today will never understand what it was like to be part of that culture and it's their loss because it was amazing!At this stage in my life, having not much difference in age than theirs, I find myself reflecting on the past. I suddenly realized my entire 'coming of age' was culminated in those moments, those mindsets, those movies. They set the tone, they defined the moment, and they ROCKED our world!So, thank you, Andrew McCarthy, Emilio Estevez, Demi Moore, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwald and Rob Lowe.

Words such as whiny or whack always seem to accompany people's shortsidedness and forget that even though this is not the typical life, it is still someone's life.What was most interesting is to see the different reactions of those who were in the Brat Pack and those who were Brat Pack ""Adjacent."" McCarthy's story comes from a perspective that an article written by a journalist, which we come to find out had gotten his idea from a dinner where he was labeled. Being 29 in the 80's wasn't considered young and he was looking for something to propel him to the next stage of his career. So were McCarthy, Nelson, Ringwald, Sheedy, Lowe, Moore and Estevez. The main difference is that the journalist's life wasn't nearly affected the way he wanted, and had no remorse for how it might have affected the lives of those he wrote about.The issue is that we as humans root for people to be successful until we feel they're too successful, become jealous and ultimately find a way to knock them down a peg. Granted it comes with fame and it just so happened that it hit McCarthy, Nelson and Ringwald the hardest. The others have gone on to much longer and more diverse careers, yet we have a hard time feeling sorry for those people who seemingly had it easy.Ask yourself if there's an event in your life that you still haven't dealt with. If you have adjusted to all trauma, kudos to you! Do you know someone in your family that hasn't? I think this was the crux of what McCarthy was trying to figure out through the exploration of people that meant a great deal to him at one time, yet never really got the answers to why it bothered everyone so. You can see the natural catharsis he goes through as he talks to Sheedy, Lowe, and even a casting director that gave him a different spin on the stigma of the Brat Pack.All in all, the lesson that they all took mostly 30 years to learn is that you're presented with two choices when being pigeon holed in Hollywood. You can allow it to dictate your career for the worse or you can rise above it like several of them did. I believe that McCarthy got the peace he was searching for.Regardless if you like the documentary or not, movies would not be the same without their generational success.",8.0,ugagolferdawg,2024-06-14,55.0,7.0

999621,No summary,"As someone who grew up with the iconic teen films of the 80s, I was eager to see this documentary. Sure...even though I have a nostalgic fondness for Andrew and the other stars of that time, there was a small part of me that prejudged this with an, ""Oh...waa waa waa...labeled a brat when you were young...how devastating."" But once I started watching, and progressively so, I realized they were experiencing the same damage that anyone who has been lied about/has a false or exaggerated reputation precede them has had to deal with...but on a larger scale. They experienced it in front of a huge audience, and in a field where one's career can be made or broken, and turned on a dime, from just one event or one narrative, however false it may be. While none of this is in the realm or war or famine or illness, it's understandable that some of these actors felt negatively impacted by, to some extent, having their dreams and goals hit a brick wall, likely due to the musings of a seemingly jealous and older-though-clearly-equally-immature writer defaming them as...immature. More on David below.I found it fitting and interesting for Andrew to explore the label/article's impact, and he did a masterful job. It was nostalgic and engaging from start to finish, due in large part to Andrew's directing talent, and the courage he and the others had in being open and vulnerable. BTW, Demi's insightfulness was quite a surprising & welcome revelation...someone get her hosting an inspirational podcast, STAT.Now for some words about David Blum:
When Andrew went to visit him, I thought, great...full circle...this will be healing. But very quickly I realized David is, well...a brat. No matter how much he tries to downplay the negativity of the term ""Brat Pack"" - which by itself is not, of course, the end of the world - it shouldn't get lost on anyone that the content of the article was also disparaging. The distorted headline together with the article is what made it damaging. He was trying to capture his moment no less than Emilio, Judd, and Rob were that night...but somehow it was only okay for him to do so. It's not terrible for an actual journalist to write facts that are negative, as too few ""journalists"" even do anymore. But it is cruel for a writer to observe a few young, burgeoning talents enjoying themselves and soaking in the glory as most early-twenty-somethings in that situation would, and then slap them - and their colleagues - with a distorted label that will limit their opportunities in a field that is very sensitive to labels. One could - and should - argue that with fame & fortune comes heaping amounts of criticism, that there are pros & cons to everything, and that it's wise to develop a strong spine to handle it...but very few of us yet have a strong enough spine at that young age...and who among us wouldn't be bothered by a widely publicized exaggeration that will alter the course of our career?The same 29 year old writer who chided their youthful exuberance is the same person who, in this doc, says, ""...partially because, you know, you're 29...that's when you make mistakes...you got to take chances and just swing and do crazy things."" So, it was okay for *him* to ""...swing and do crazy things"", but not okay for them? Not only that, but he defamed them for it. Got it, David.We also get to see that it's apparently okay for *him* to complain about being criticized, as he does when he shares that he thought film critic Richard Schickel ""...was there, it seemed to me, to attack me...and I'm like, really? That seems a little harsh, you know..."" Again, these things are all okay for Blum, but apparently not okay for younger, more successful people (including Tom Cruise - don't miss David's attempted dig on him, too).It should also be noted that his ridiculous point of separating those who went to acting school vs. Those who achieved their fame/success during or fresh out of high school puts his childish, insecure, elitist brattiness on full, glaring display...and that's the poetic justice in all of this: ultimately, the world gets to see that the only actual BRAT all along was - and is - David Blum.",10.0,pdxseayvr,2024-06-13,115.0,15.0

Yeah, maybe AM's project was in and of itself ""bratty"", but so what. After hearing Blum out as well as the others it's kind of an ""all's fair in love and war"" theme. He was a young journalist building a career and it was within the bounds of what makes America great. AM isn't being any nicer here. Even if you deem AM's project a whine fest, if it earns him new looks from Hollywood and/or the public, good for him.Here's the thing though - both my older and younger siblings were born just outside the 67-71 timeframe, the ""brat pack"" films didn't have nearly the same impact as they did with me and the group I with which I grew up (68-70). Same will be true with AM's project. More importantly, not a single one of us read the article... Still haven't. Until I watched this film I had absolutely no idea the ""brat pack"" moniker had anything very negative associated with it. No one, not even people who were in high school in suburbs of Chicago in the mid 80s can really wax intelligent prose on this whole debate if they didn't see each of the films at the theater in their day AND read the entire, original article.I thought it was enjoyable to watch, so the guys I did a lot of dumb things with in the mid 80s.",8.0,JasonBelle,2024-06-13,19.0,5.0

999621,No summary,"I never thought the tittle ""Brat Pack"" was degrading or bad press for these young actors from the 80's. I simply believed that these actors Andrew McCarthy, Rob Lowe, Demi Moore, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy, Mare Winningham, James Spader, Anthony M. Hall and several more had great chemistry and made sincere and enjoyable coming of age movies. We could all relate to one of the characters they portrayed or to traits from a combination of characters. I thought Demi Moore and Rob Lowe had good attitudes and seemed to use belonging to the ""Brat Pack"" in a positive way to move forward with their lives and careers, they figured it out. I read these actors were told to avoid each other, not be seen together or to do any further projects together, by their publicists I would assume. They were young and impressionable and maybe all of it could have been dealt with in a more professional, productive way. The movies they made together are classics and still have an impact on everyone that watches them today. They can be proud of that. I believe that the journalist tricked his way into their lives and wrote an article to advance his career tho he knew it wasn't the right thing to do...but his article had little negative impact on the fans of John Hugh's and the fans of the ""Brat Pack"" actors. We just loved the movies and they reached us on an emotional level. I was quite a fan of Molly Ringwald's vintage fashion and probably not the only one. These actors were really amazing in the 80's and had no reason to run away from each other and to never see or talk to each other again. They may have made several more good movies with any combination of them starring in them. They could have been lifelong friends. I enjoyed this documentary and the interviews from the actors who did talk to Andrew M. It was enlightening.

999621,No summary,"My review title is misleading. I don't have a problem with these actors, my problem is with the weak documentary. This is a clear attention grab from an 80's actor that in my opinion is popular by association. Drew Mack is probably best remembered for his role in Pretty in Pink which in my opinion is bolstered by the James Spader and Jon Cryer performances. I didn't even remember he was in St. Elmo's but at the same time, I don't find that movie memorable.These projects are rarely good. I find it impossible to tell your own tale. Since he is part of the culture being examined, he is the last person that should be helming this project. There are two people referenced that don't appear in this film and ironically, one often gives Brat Pack interviews, so I was shocked that she declined to participate. At the same time there was no mention of Tony Hall, C. T. Howell, Charlie Sheen, or several other Brat Pack adjacent actors.You can also tell that true success is the best therapy and when Jon Cryer proudly proclaims he was not in the brat pack (Not a spoiler, in the trailer) you get a true sense that despite living through it and being associated, he does not give a flunk. He's no Rob Lowe, but still had massive success on his own scale. R. I. P. Maxwell Houser.In the right hands this could have been emotional, suspenseful and liberating, but D Mack is not a film maker and it showed with glaring proof in this attention grab of a weak reunion piece.Kudos to Emile Estavez.

Sadly not all the Brat packers didnt show up which is a shame. Andrew did a good job choosing certain 80s songs that represented that era. I also felt Andrew vibed more with certain brats like Demi and Rob than others. As a an 80s kid and seeing the movies you grew up watching brings back happy memories.

999621,No summary,"This documentary sheds light on the personal experience for a group of actors who many of us loved to watch but whose actual lives were unknown to us. Easy to understand how at such a young age the label of being in the ""brat pack"" could have lasting impact. It's not often you reach such a level of fame and success, and then in a single day are given a brand you never wanted. Andrew conveys his experience and meets with others in the brat pack and discusses their experiences and insights. FYI - Demi is an of insightful sage.As a fan of the brat pack, it was simply great to see them all again. The documentary was enlightening as I never even considered being part of the brat pack could be a negative thing. To me the brat pack was a group of actors who portrayed our experiences as teenagers on screen and we wanted to see them in every movie. Seeing them in ensembles was great, as were solo features, we never took it negatively but rather as a way to connect with them and always wish for their success.Overall, this is one I recommend as a case study in the power of the written word. Once article changed all their lives, and this picture shows you how. Worth watching and well made. The nostalgia factor is also mind blowing and made this so much more enjoyable. Think of this as the brat pack finally dealing with their demons from the past, while we get to learn about them, their connections to one another, and how they felt about this brand. It also made me realize how much I missed them all; never will there be a time like the 80s again and never will there be such a talented group of young actors like the brat pack ever again.",10.0,skider,2024-06-13,62.0,11.0

It's a self induced therapy session that seems to completely miss any reflection or personal responsibility for being actors who were extremely popular but possibly without enough talent to take them to the second stage of their careers. A few of the successful actors who did manage a long and healthy career seem to cringe in their interviews at Andrew's inability to get over a label that was beloved by their fans.

Pretty awesome to say the least. It would truly change competition gaming to a very high level unheard of in our lifetimes. But this movie goes a bit off the rails as the agoraphobic young girl does a video game competition for a lot of money and her friend bets on her winning to get even more , but her haunting visions take her over and her also dead agoraphobic mother begins to use her and do unspeakable things. She basically turns into a nightmare of a person. Not for the squeamish, some gore, a few really scary bits.

1042657,No summary,"""Latency"" has a pretty interesting premise, and the viewer is immediately thrown into some virtual action with the main character, Hana. She is a professional gamer who suffers from acute agoraphobia. Shortly after receiving some highly advanced new gaming equipment, strange things start happening, and it seems like the new equipment is trying to control her. As I mentioned, the premise sounded really interesting, and the effects in the opening scene looked pretty decent. Sasha Luss does a good job as Hana, though her accent slipped a few times.Another thing that felt unrealistic was the portrayal of this absolutely beautiful and flawless woman, who also has an equally attractive girlfriend, played by Alexis Ren, as a professional gamer who spends most of her time playing online games. While it makes sense in terms of her agoraphobia, it was hard to buy into this setup in the movie. I'm not saying that beautiful women can't be gamers, but in this context, it felt unconvincing.Another issue is that the movie ultimately leads nowhere, with a narrative that is fairly mainstream and predictable. The ending was unsatisfying, with many questions left unanswered and multiple plot points leading into a void. Overall, the result was pretty unspectacular and below average.

1042657,No summary,"""Latency"" is a film that offers a mixed bag of impressive visuals and technical prowess but falters significantly in its narrative and character execution. With a rating of 5 out of 10, it's clear that while the film isn't a total failure, it does not quite reach the threshold of a good movie. Let me delve deeper into the various aspects of this film to provide a comprehensive understanding of why it falls into this middling category.Firstly, the production quality of ""Latency"" is commendable. The filmmakers have evidently invested a significant amount of time and resources into ensuring that the film looks polished and visually appealing. The graphics are particularly noteworthy, showcasing a level of detail and sophistication that is on par with some of the best in the industry. Whether it's the intricate design of the futuristic cityscape or the seamless integration of CGI elements, the visual experience is one of the high points of this film. This technical excellence in production is a substantial reason why I rated the film a 5, as it demonstrates a clear effort to create an engaging visual spectacle.However, a film's strength cannot rely solely on its visual appeal. The crux of any good movie lies in its storytelling and character development, areas where ""Latency"" unfortunately falls short. The story, which starts with an intriguing premise, quickly loses its momentum. The initial setup promises a captivating journey, but as the plot progresses, it becomes apparent that the narrative lacks depth and coherence. The middle part of the film, which should ideally build on the initial intrigue and develop the plot further, feels rushed and underdeveloped. Key plot points are glossed over, leaving the audience with a sense of confusion and dissatisfaction.The acting, too, leaves much to be desired. While the cast comprises some talented individuals, their performances are hampered by poorly written dialogue and lackluster character arcs. The protagonists fail to evoke empathy or connect with the audience on an emotional level, making it challenging to invest in their journey. This disconnect is further exacerbated by the film's pacing issues. The rapid progression of events, particularly towards the latter half of the film, gives the impression that the filmmakers were more concerned with wrapping up the story rather than allowing it to unfold naturally.One of the most glaring issues with ""Latency"" is the ending. The climax, which should serve as the culmination of the film's narrative and thematic elements, feels rushed and unsatisfying. Important plot threads are left unresolved, and the resolution lacks the emotional impact that is crucial for a fulfilling cinematic experience. This hurried conclusion undermines the initial promise of the film, leaving the audience with a sense of incompletion.Despite these shortcomings, there are a few redeeming aspects of ""Latency"" that warrant recognition. The soundtrack, for instance, complements the visual elements effectively, enhancing the overall atmosphere of the film. The cinematography, too, deserves a mention for its innovative use of camera angles and lighting to create mood and tension. These elements, though not enough to elevate the film to greatness, contribute to its overall aesthetic appeal.In conclusion, ""Latency"" is a film that had the potential to be much more than it ultimately is. Its impressive production quality and graphics are overshadowed by a weak narrative, underdeveloped characters, and a rushed conclusion. While it may offer a visually pleasing experience, it fails to deliver on the essential elements of storytelling and emotional engagement that define a truly good film. Thus, with a rating of 5 out of 10, ""Latency"" stands as a reminder that great visuals alone do not make a great movie; a compelling story and strong performances are equally, if not more, important.",5.0,marselleandres,2024-07-15,18.0,3.0
1042657,No summary,"""Latency"" starts off strong, gripping you with the story of Hana, a talented agoraphobic gamer who finds solace and competition in the virtual world. The film cleverly explores the allure of online gaming for those who struggle with social interaction in the real world. Sasha Luss delivers a captivating performance as Hana, embodying the vulnerability and determination of a woman yearning for connection.The initial setup is promising. The introduction of the experimental gaming tech that blurs the lines between reality and the virtual world is intriguing. I was hooked, quickly planning out when to sit down with my daughters to watch as I was expecting well crafted moments where the lines of reality truly break down and the horror unfolds.However, ""Latency"" loses momentum halfway through. The initial chills and suspense start to dissipate, replaced by a dragging plot that fails to deliver the full-blown mind-bender we were primed for. The scares become predictable, and the exploration of the psychological impact of the technology feels underdeveloped.Despite the cool-off, the film does hold value as a cautionary tale. It effectively portrays the anxieties that can arise when the virtual world becomes all-consuming, especially for someone already grappling with isolation. The fear of losing control and the blurring of boundaries between reality and game become especially poignant for Hana, who's already dealing with the loss of a normal life due to her agoraphobia.""Latency"" is a film with a strong initial concept and a captivating lead performance.

On the surface its is a psychological thriller with a dark and gritty scifi twist. Good enough, right? But there's much more to it than that. What I think is really happening is that the director, James Croke, has disguised a deeply philosophical grounded art house film in the skin of a stylish, well executed, studio production. A reality bending trick like moments in the film itself. It is hard to believe this is the director's first film. I look forward to his next.The lead, Sasha Luss, is excellent as Hana.

Those scripts in those old Cannon flicks were just an excuse to get to as many action set pieces as possible and this seems like the route they went with this, at least the end of the film is definitely rigged that way (in a good way, mind you).",6.0,nathanarnold999,2024-11-25,0.0,0.0

The story is underwhelming and cheap, it's a stretch that there are BAD GUYS who kidnap children and have no real motive apart from being annoyed by the main character. I was bored watching this film i had to fast forward increments. Congrats to Bren Foster for putting this together but he's a very average actor and not so good director and the writing is amateurish. The lead actress is really good and spunky and has a bright future and also Annabelle Stephenson. It tries to be American, but the plot doesn't allow for it to be realistic and feels contrived and forced, nothing feels unnatural. Even some of the dialogue and gaps between dialogue and some stares very awkward and cringy. One point for the filmmakers to look at it - and this may be an editing problem is - when receptionist asks if the girls walked through the GYM, there is a delay in response and doesn't even show any urgency that kids may have been kidnapped. A Note to all Australian film-makers - Story comes first - This felt like it was designed to accommodate the skills of Bren Foster, so he designed a mediocre story around that. Better than most Screen Australia funded films so congrats on making a decent Indie film.",4.0,movieguy3000,2024-07-08,4.0,6.0

1289601,No summary,"There's something of a stigma when it comes to direct-to-video (DTV) genre movies, and even as a fan it's easy to see why - too many of them just aren't very good. Their exceedingly low budgets are typically blamed, but it's a hollow excuse as talented and determined filmmakers have proven again and again that gold can be spun out of straw. The latest example of this is an unassuming little DTV action movie from Australia called Life After Fighting. It's a very inexpensive film without a single big name, and while it deserves a theatrical showing it's been relegated to premiering on VOD. But also? It's a real contender for the year's best action movie.There will be no doubts that Life After Fighting is an indie production - it's no accident that the bulk of the film's running time takes place in and around the dojo where Alex teaches - and that's nowhere more clear than in the opening credits. Foster not only stars in the lead role here, but he's also the film's director, writer, producer, and fight choreographer. Hell, he even wrote the lyrics to some of the original songs in the film. That kind of ownership isn't unheard of, but most of the action stars who've dabbled behind the camera (Jackie Chan, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal) did so after they'd been established as lead performers.

So, so far so good.The acting was ok and we can claim solid mixed with interesting dialogues and some, of course, predictable drama, typical of a low budget film. But, at the moment that the heat of the situation kicked in all started to go downhill from there.Utterly silly decisions made by the characters, improbable of a realistic situation, make the two main actors (him and her) look like the dumbest people on the planet.How many movies have we seen already where the main role suddenly believes he or she has super powers, and try to rescue or fight a gang of criminals without any help?Yet, some film directors seem to be convinced that the audience, that would be us, all suffer from mental challenges, and we will consider those actions realistic, plausible and even convincing.Now, if I were the actor in the main role and upon reading the script I see: ""serious film, no sarcasm or comedy, you do this and that"" and those acts make me look like a clown in front of my audience, I wonder what I would do...?Would I take the role?

1289601,No summary,"This film shows how famous Australian Drama can be incorporated with action Martial Arts. I went in expecting a generic 80's style martial arts movie, I left with my entire opinion of fight choreography entirely changed.I believe the format of fight choreography is honestly a break through that Hollywood can learn a lot from. Master Bren shows how much of an expert he truly is in all fields as a Martial Artist, Actor and Director.To elaborate on this, Master Bren perfectly demonstrates how fight choreography against multiple opponents should be done. Opponents attack more than one at a time and Master Bren utilizes Grappling alongside Striking to subdue one opponent at a time giving him opportunity to deal with the other(s). With a realistic twist being that opponents in fact wake up from submissions and knock outs much like real life, something I have not seen any movie do ever. This means one opponent has multiple fight scenes until killed or broken down and rendered unable to fight.On top of this, I loved how the film conveys how a Combat Sport athlete would slowly adopt ""illegal moves"" in a street fight. For example, earlier on in the film, we see Master Bren doing striking and very MMA focused grappling that would be considered legal in an MMA ruleset as this is what he trains for, but as he progresses through his fights, he slowly realises more and more, that this is not a competition and he needs to go beyond what he is used to. Thus utilising throat and eye gouging, groin shots, strikes to the back of the neck, slamming opponents directly on their necks, etc.The film has blown my mind and I truly believe this is the next step in fight choreography. Master Bren alongside Mr Jimmy, Mr Nick and Mr Jaylan have made a masterpiece in terms of hand to hand combat on the big screen. It is a much watch for martial artists, fighters or even fans of the action genre. Excited to see what Master Bren brings in the future!",10.0,sudhishmlal,2024-06-19,4.0,6.0

I studied archaeology in Macedonia in the late 70's and in their capital Skopje there was a cinema called Kino Napredok (cinema Progress) that was situated in the Bit Bazaar, the area mainly inhabited by Albanians and Roma people (Gypsies as they call them). In that cinema there were only Western movies, Kung Fu or fighting movies (Bruce Lee was the most popular), Bolywood films and erotic masterpieces like Last Tango in Paris, Emanuelle or anything with naked bodies that is NOT porn! The audience were mostly uneducated bunch of movie lovers that had trouble reading subtitles, and didn't buy popcorn as a snack but will bring their own garlic salami that they will chew while the movie is on with half a kilo fresh bread... I cannot really describe the atmosphere in it... it is more than enthusiastic for EVERY movie in that always packed cinema that started at 9 a.m. And continued until 9 p.m.Well, this Australian movie was perfect for that cinema... I know it is late for cinema Progress, almost 50 years late, but the audience would appreciate the 2 hours in the cinema that had more than half just in fights... all sorts of fights! The screenplay felt like written by an AI system later revised by human editors and I admit that some good acting and good fighting saved it to be just watchable for me...

An entertaining film with fight scenes that were blended perfectly. Boxing, wrestling, taekwondo, bjj, muay thai, knife fighting, a little judo, and the list goes on; it had it all. One fight scene alone was worth purchasing this film. In a business full of fake/repetitive trash, Bren brought forward one of the best action/martial arts films I've seen. He would be my pick for the next Batman or The Punisher. He displayed a range of physicality/ability/talent that actors in my opinion are lacking today. My wife and I both enjoyed it.

He must fight off waves of bad guys, who are also apparently really good at martial arts.

1289601,No summary,"Was EYE ever surprised by this movie...i had another one ready for when i would delete THIS one, after watching for, i thought, fifteen or twenty minutes. TOPS. But by that time i already knew that this was not just some shallow storytelling bolstered by the martial arts angle...no. There was a good story, as well...
but the martial arts scenes were, in my opinion, very well done, as well...and, since a lot of the other reviewers are saying the same, i'm not hesitating to say it, as well...
but, again, there's another story going on that's very worthwhile...
i'm thinking that this guy...main character...director...has a future in the business...i can't imagine that this movie had a high budget... and i HOPE that if he DOES get his hands on some money beCAUSE of how well this movie does(and it SHOULD do well...kind of a Rocky, in its own right), that he will not lose perspective and keep it from going over the top...
but he HAS to have discipline to get to where he is NOW...so i'm not all that worried that this would happen...
so someone throw some money at this guy and let's see what ELSE he can do...
by the way...just so you don't wonder...i live in the Netherlands and am in no WAY affiliated with him/the production...except, now, as a fan...i really WAS surprised...
oh. And it WASn't 'flawless'...i thought the last scene...well...it COULD've been shorter if he'd done what EYE would've done in that situation...but i won't say anything else because i don't do spoilers...but i understand why he chose to do it the way he did...
i still enjoyed it, otherwise...
i came back to edit this...a six point TWO rating? How did THAT happen...a SEVEN i could tolerate but most of the review are at LEAST a seven...so what's up with THIS???

1289601,No summary,"I've been a fan of Bren Foster for years now and often wondered why he's not a big action star. He has the looks, the physique, incredible martial arts skills and can act. It's another missed opportunity similar to the amazing Scott Adkins. Hopefully Life after fighting will be the launch pad for bigger and better things for Bren , as it's very clear he threw his heart and soul into this project and wore many hats including, writer,producer, director, action choreographer and lead actor. The rest of the cast did a great job too and play their roles really well making it easy for the viewer to invest in the characters and straight forward story that deals with child trafficking, a subject that sickens just about anyone, and the bad guy's in this movie are real pieces of s@#t and there's a couple of scenes that are tough to watch. There's some great martial arts scenes throughout the first two thirds of the movie that lead nicely into the last third that is non stop martial arts carnage, that showcases Mr Foster's incredible skills and those of his students/ stunt team. Speaking of the fight scenes, one reviewer complained that the camera work was too shakey. As someone who has been watching martial arts movies all his life, and has an extensive collection from many different countries, I can assure you that the fights are shot brilliantly. The camera moves around the action perfectly, immersing the viewer in the action while at the same time allowing the excellent choreography to be appreciated. Bravo to the camera man or women who shot those scenes, probably a martial artist themselves. Any real martial arts movie fan will know exactly what I mean when watching. I very highly recommend this movie to action fans and anyone who likes to see horrible people get what they deserve. Hopefully the beast that is Bren Foster will see his star rise, he deserves it, 10/10.",10.0,rambo78,2024-06-10,13.0,11.0
1289601,No summary,"Not that long ago i saw the trailer for this movie and remembered the lead actor from a movie i saw with Steven Seagal call Force of Execution about 10 years ago or so. He was very solid in it in term of fighting but for whatever reason, its like he never really did anything more when it comes to Martial Arts? After watching his IMDB resume it seem he spent lots of years in recurring roles in TV shows so that could explain.Fast forward many years later and this one finally get release, so i give it a rent on Xbox (i couldn't buy it even if i wanted to for whatever reason, rental only) and this really surprised the heck out of me.I mean the trailer did showed some good fight sequences but with DTV martial arts flick you never know. But i was actually blown away.The movie has a rather surprisingly long run time for the genre at 2h, but it want to establish the characters well so you feel for them. It still manage to insert enough fight scenes and training scenes in that first and second act that i never felt bored or that it moved too slow.Once you get in the third act tough is where the show start. BRUTAL fight scenes, fast pace, great choreographies. I read in some other reviews that there was too much ""shaky cams"" but i think the guy may have had a few beers too much because i didn't notice much shaky cams at all. Yes sometimes the camera follow the action and its not completely steady but its not ""shaky"" at all.Story touch on some hard subject and without reinventing anything, it is solid enough to be a base for the action show.Bren Foster not only star in it, but also directed and written it, so it was really a passion project for him and he succeeded at making a very good modern day Martial Art movie mixing both old school kicks and flips with a more grounded BJJ style of modern MMA.Other than Scott Adkins its been pretty dry outside of Asia when it comes to this genre. You got Michael Jai White putting one out here and here, but for some reasons he appears often as a guest star in non-martial art movies (i assume he don't want to be type casted) and when he do put one, they not always exactly great. Some are very low budget and it show.I don't know how big was the budget for Life After Fighting, but even tough there is nothing extremely expensive in it (explosions, car chases or big action set piece), everything they done especially the climax really look great and its very well directed when it comes to the fights.If i must mention a negative, i would say Bren Foster altough an amazing on screen fighter, lack a bit in term of acting when it comes to emotions, but then again you don't watch a movie like this for academy award type of actings. It was fine enough.Overall this is one i will like to add to my physical collection so hopefully i can get at least a DVD at some point.

And it kind of even crosses a line in between.Of course, it revolves pretty much how you expect it, with the main guy virtually having super powers. But that does not detract from the movie.But the absolute standout quality of this film is the direction of the fight scenes. They are very real, visceral und the physicality of them is conveyed very well. I caught myself twitching with some of the hits.....which is very rare.

1289601,No summary,"Ok... let me get this straight..
If you are not into martial arts movies or not into martial arts this movie will probably overwhelm you..But if you are into martial arts movies and sad that while movies like John Wick get more and more mainstream.. good martial arts movies are getting rare these days...
Movies like Ong Bak, the raid, undisputed 2 & 3 are such exceptions and most movies of the current straight to video stars are hard to watch and feature hardly any fights that aren't underwhelming..Entering Bren Foster!The man that is known to way too few..some remember him from the last ship or force of execution and were waiting ever since for his all out starring break out movie...He basically wrote this, produced this, shot it in his school with his actual instructors and students making the movie sometimes look like a docudrama.While you can of course see a bit the limited budget in the production scale, I must say the acting is solid and the movie crazy dark and realistic in many ways and goes places you wouldn't expect...There us no performance that takes you out of the experience but I must say I was say how many scenes actually caught me in there intensity..That being said... what about the action...Jesus!!!! I can watch Bren train and spar and having little fights all day and you get plenty of that throughout the movie...
But while the movie makes it with no fake explosions or similar dtv action crap.. has very few gun shots and sets up a showdown that is (like teased in the trailer) Bren vs 9 guys in his martial arts school..Now what could be a small scale non event showdown had an intensity that had me almost exhausted..If the bad guys would't be ultra bad scumbags you would almost feel like this is turning into a horror film where they are trapped by a maniac martial arts killer!Bren is so intense in his violence that its sometimes almost shocking to watch and gives his fights such a unique character
His students and trainers that are basically the stunt team here take so much abuse that it feels like all of them went to the raid 1 &2 in one go..On a martial arts level this film will surpass everything the normal viewer can comprehend...Bren did something here I always wished for...he makes very grounded gritty and sometimes super violent fights yet there is sooooo much beauty and art for the schooled eye...I can't even tell what he does best... throwing cheat 720 back kicks faster then normal people do a front kick?Doing crazy intricate BJJ grapling and judo throws where you finally see what it would look like if a black belt bjj guy shot a fight movie?Doing the fastest Panantukan trapping, dirty boxing, kali knife work done in film making you wish soneone in the bourne movies had thise skills?Doing all the thai ellbows, clinch set ups, flying knees and leg catch counters you ever wanted to try in muay thai class?Hap Ki Do throws you haven't seen since Philip Rhee but done in a speed that makes young steven segal look like he moves now..
Or all of that and more!!Its insane! Bren is the definition of mixed martial arts and all is done so proficient and high level that current martial arts actors must cross their fingers that not everyone sees this movie cause it raises the bar beyond what has been shown today!Yes the movie feels a bit like a big scale TV film but its really well put together..and if you have trained martial arts, have taught them, had fights or anything like that.. this film gets you on a whole different level...There are do many scenes where you know the guy who has written this has a school... train for years.. battles with age and aches.. and when you see Bren talking to himself during a dramatic fight you know that only someone who has put himself through the ringer writes stiff like that...
Truly an awesome genre gem stone!!!If you like martial arts movies purchase this and watch it!!! We need more Bren Foster...Imagine this man in a big movie like the raid!!!!",10.0,georg-34152,2024-06-07,13.0,13.0

The original Casa Bonita (at 39th & Portland - about 5 miles from our house) had just opened and back then it was all you could eat for $1.25 The place was a monster hit and often the lines were insane. As a teenager, I could eat 3 or 4 platefuls of their great food with my favorite being the cheese enchiladas. As their popularity grew, they expanded into nearly Tulsa, Little Rock, Ft. Worth and Denver. The original was not nearly impressive like the Tulsa and Denver locations. At first it was just food and service but later evolved into having (sometimes) live musicians and a costumed monkey that sometimes scared the crap out of the little kids. But it was all fun. The service was so so good. You had a little flag on the table. Raise it and someone would pop over immediately to get whatever you wanted. After the OKC store closed (in 1993 I think), we would often come up with excuses to travel to Tulsa just to eat at Casa Bonita. We were quite impressed by the difference in the Tulsa location and the OKC original. They had caves, cliff divers, puppets, magicians, etc. The food was just as good too. Really bummed us out when that location closed down. After I found out there was still a Denver location, I started looking into it and found the story that it had been on South Park and the guys there had purchased it. Kudos to them and I have to get there for another taste. I can't ever remember happier meals anywhere better than Casa Bonita.

If you didn't do it, no one would have.Back in 2016 my husband and I were in Colorado to visit Casa Bonita. We were too tired to go and it closed before we had the chance to try again. We always regretted not going and loved that episode from South Park. We didn't grow up going there but did spend time living in Oaxaca and Puebla Mexico so it seemed like the perfect place to reimagine those areas.We visited again in 2023 for our ten year anniversary but were sadly turned away as there was a Willy Wonka ticketing system where you had to get an email invitation to make a reservation. One year later we finally got the email and I told my husband ""We have to go back!"". Just like Cartman, I would do anything to go. We drove there from Kentucky with our parrot and if you ask me if it's worth it, my response will be ""totally"". I wore the perfect pink shirt to match the new paint and even the security guard appreciated it. Once inside, we felt like kids again. You almost get lost trying to figure out how to get to the food, but it's fun. There is so much to do there that I'm not sure we did everything after seeing this documentary! Having our caricature done by a cranky old Welsh guy near the puppet show was my favorite part. We got to hear Trey's voice over the loud speaker announcing the cliff divers and puppet show and it felt so good to feel his involvement. You can hear him in Blackbart's Cave as well. They really did so many improvements that it felt like a new facility, not simply a remake of an old one. The actors were fantastic as well, especially the divers and the dancing they did before the dive. The pirate by the wishing well handed us a coin and told us to make a wish and throw it in. A preteen kid went before us and yelled ""I wish to be cool!"". He hung around for my wish, so I promptly yelled ""I wish to be cooler than that kid!"". That was probably the funniest memory I'll have from that place and need Matt and Trey to know they created the space for me and that kid to have those memories (or scars in his case) for life.If you've been there since the reopening, nothing compares. I recently shot pool with some Denver locals and they complained that the food there wasn't as good as Mexican restaurants nearby. I didn't find this to be true. Our food was pretty great and the sopapillas were fantastic. Our drinks were amazing too. The adults were having as much fun as the kids and that's how you know you've done a good thing.

While The Glassworker showcases stunning visuals, its overhyped reviews seem inflated, likely by non-viewers or overzealous fans. Despite claims of a decade-long production, the film fails to justify its runtime or thematic aspirations. Borrowing heavily from Studio Ghibli and Western styles, it lacks originality and fails to establish a genuine cultural identity. Its cultural influence seems minimal-roughly 2%-as it attempts to blend local themes with borrowed elements, resulting in a disjointed narrative.The Good: Stunning Visuals and Artistic Effort
The visual artistry is undeniably the film's strongest aspect. The glassworking sequences and picturesque backgrounds reveal a high level of craftsmanship. While the Ghibli influence is evident, the visuals do manage to carve out some individuality through their vibrant palette and intricate detailing. If animation alone were the benchmark, The Glassworker might deserve praise.Audio elements are decent but lack memorability. The score occasionally shines but often feels misplaced, with music overused in scenes where stronger dialogue was needed to convey emotion.The Bad: Weak Characters and Narrative
Characterisation is one of the film's glaring weaknesses. While the protagonist's role as a glassworker and the female lead's military background offer potential, these elements are shallow and underexplored. The supporting characters-friends, family, and rivals-are painfully one-dimensional, adhering to clichéd archetypes that fail to engage.The plot itself is a mess. Events unfold randomly, lacking the necessary cause-and-effect structure that makes a story cohesive. Attempts to create tension or conflict fall flat, leaving viewers disengaged. The non-linear storytelling feels more like an unnecessary gimmick than a meaningful narrative device, adding confusion instead of depth.The Ugly: Disjointed Themes and Poor Execution
Thematically, The Glassworker aims high but delivers little. The film struggles to weave its themes of art, love, and war into a coherent narrative. Instead of delivering a nuanced story, it offers a disjointed collection of scenes, some of which feel outright pointless. The supposed ""twist ending,"" intended to leave an impact, is poorly executed, leaving viewers more baffled than moved.The inclusion of supernatural elements is a particularly puzzling choice. Set up repeatedly throughout the film, these elements fail to deliver any meaningful payoff, instead undermining the grounded aspects of the story. The climactic ""one arm"" scene, presumably intended as a dramatic high point, comes across as absurd and unintentionally comedic.Overreliance on Borrowed Styles
The film's Ghibli-esque aesthetic and narrative structure feel more like mimicry than homage. While being inspired by a master is no sin, The Glassworker copies rather than builds upon these influences, diluting its artistic integrity. Without adding originality or authenticity, the film feels like a hollow imitation that misses the heart and soul of its inspirations.Final Thoughts
While the animation is commendable for a first project, The Glassworker ultimately feels like an underwhelming experience. Its ambition to emulate Ghibli and blend it with cultural themes is admirable but poorly realised. The end result is a visually appealing but thematically shallow film that struggles to resonate emotionally or intellectually.Verdict: 3/10
Despite its visual merits, The Glassworker is a cautionary tale about the dangers of overreliance on borrowed styles and weak storytelling. The claims of a decade-long production feel unwarranted, as the end product lacks polish and originality. Fans of animation may appreciate the artistry, but discerning viewers will likely find it a forgettable experience. It's good to be inspired, but copying without innovation only highlights the flaws-and this film has plenty of them.",3.0,Arck-61550,2024-11-15,1.0,0.0

629078,No summary,"The animation was hands-off amazing. The visuals were stunning and appealing, evident of the amount of effort and hark work put into each frame of the movie. The animators did a great job capturing the essence of Ghibli films. The music really brought the viewing experience to the next level, literally got goosebumps hearing some of them.However... the voice acting could have been somewhat better. The delivery of the dialogues felt a bit off because of the British accent, considering the characters were set in Pakistan. Some scenes felt as if a certain frame was missing, messing with the consistency while some had very fluid animation. As for the storyline, it seemed rather messy and confusing. The theme and storyline could have been portrayed a bit better which would've enhanced the experience greatly.Overall really enjoyed the movie, would recommend watching it, and really respect Usman Riaz's artistic view and effort on this movie. Creating a hand-drawn animated film in Pakistan is not a small feat and he did an amazing job for such a big project.

629078,No summary,"First, let me get this out the way, the movie is aesthetically a masterpiece. Would have never believed that such a beautiful, hand-drawn animation could come out of Pak. The Urdu voice actors were fantastic too, especially the person who voiced Vincent's Dad.Beyond that I felt the film severely lacked in storyboarding, character development, and overall character arcs. It got tedious and boring at times in between the usual Ghibli tropes. They could have definitely perfected the script in the 10 years the film spent in development. But, in the end they drew stunning animation for a very weak story. Despite that, I was totally on-board with the pacifist message that formed the crux of the story.Also, they market the film as made-in Pak, but the characters and setting look ostensibly western. I mean, I get it that they wanted to appeal to a global audience, but they could have incorporated more of the local culture apart from token mentions. After all, the film's core viewership and theatre-going base was to be in Pak.Despite the weak story, I would commend the score of the film. It was hauntingly beautiful and executed masterfully within scenes.In conclusion, despite it's obvious flaws, The Glassworker is a film to watch for art lovers & Ghibli fans. You might be bored by the story and characters, but the the visuals and music score will keep you there till the end.P. S: I have heard that the English voiceover is not as good. I watched it in Urdu, so can't comment on that opinion. The Urdu version was quite well done.",7.0,deltaop,2024-08-11,0.0,0.0

I always buy Blu-rays for every movie but when I heard about ""The Glasswork"", the first 2d animation made in my country. I simply had to go to the cinema and being a die-hard anime enthusiast for the last 8 years I couldn't afford to miss it. The opportunity to watch it at the cinema with my friend was just amazing. And it was totally worth going to the cinema for. When I said, I have no words to do justice to this movie. Usman Riaz is a passionate dude and when I watched his interviews and the trailer for the movie, I knew that this movie would not disappoint me. This guy tackled all the challenges and ended up making a masterpiece despite everyone telling him that he was wasting his time. The characters, the story, the music, and most importantly the theme of the story, Everything was just beyond my expectations. I love the Ghibli-style art too. The theme of innocent childhood and love versus the unforgiving war and the losses, struggles and tragedies that come with it was fleshed out so well in the movie. The characters (especially Vincent) were very relatable. I suggest everyone watch this movie at least once in their lifetime if you're a fan of animated media.

629078,No summary,"A good animated movie butt story could be more
Visuals: The animation style draws clear inspiration from Studio Ghibli, showcasing beautiful art with vivid imagery that captivates the viewer. While some scenes are exceptionally well-animated, others display inconsistency in fluidity.Audio: The film features a generally good audio experience with an engaging score that complements the visuals. However, there are moments where dialogue could have been prioritized over music to enhance emotional impact.MiditivesPlot Holes: Minor inconsistencies exist but do not significantly detract from the overall narrative. For instance, a scene involving a character parachuting down while delivering a gift raises questions about logistics.Voice Acting: The English dub received mixed reviews; some found it comical and lacking emotional depth, particularly when native Urdu words were awkwardly pronounced.NegativesWriting Quality: The screenplay struggles with coherence and depth. While it ambitiously tackles heavy themes, the execution falters in the second half, leading to a lackluster payoff for its setup.Character Development: Characters are portrayed with simplistic motivations that fail to resonate deeply with viewers. There is little complexity or growth throughout the narrative.Pacing Issues: The plot often feels disjointed with events happening to characters rather than being driven by them. This results in a slow pace that can be frustrating for audiences.Non-linear Storytelling: The use of non-linear storytelling does not enhance the narrative; instead, it complicates understanding and detracts from enjoyment.Supernatural Elements: A magical realist aspect involving a djinn feels unnecessary and poorly integrated into the story, undermining its intended emotional weight.Ending Execution: The conclusion attempts to deliver a twist but ends up feeling confusing and farcical. Many viewers left puzzled rather than satisfied.Overall Impression
While ""The Glassworker"" showcases stunning visuals and represents an important cultural achievement for Pakistani cinema, it ultimately falls short due to its writing weaknesses and character development issues. With an overall score of 5.4/10 from one reviewer (with others rating it higher), it appears that while some audiences may appreciate its artistic merits, many will find its narrative execution lacking.",8.0,abaidrehman-30519,2024-08-03,0.0,1.0

The ending was confusing to say the least, as many of the plot of the movie was missing and the movie rapped it up pretty quickly.

The labor of love is evident in the fluid animation and intricate details that bring the fantastical world of Glassworker to life.",10.0,shahzadiftikhar,2024-07-27,13.0,4.0
629078,No summary,"Snapshot: Audio-visually appealing, thematically messy. 5.4/10This review merely describes my own experience with this movie; my semi-processed thoughts immediately after watching the English dub of ""The Glassworker"". I shall endeavour to keep it as spoiler-free as possible, so there might be some dancing around specifics.I have fewer positives than negatives, so let's start with the positives.+ Positives:. Visuals: The Ghibli inspiration is evident throughout the film. Resulting in a beautiful art style with plenty of vivid, striking imagery. Kudos to the artists. If visuals are your primary concern, this movie might be worth your time. The only criticism here might be that it is inspired too directly by greater works, which dilutes it's own potential artistic individuality/flair.The animation itself was a bit inconsistent. Some key scenes were beautiful drawn and fluidly animated (a few stood out as extremely good), most scenes were decently animated, but some scenes looked rather stilted and lacked frames (only a couple of minor scenes stood out as downright bad in this aspect).. Audio: Overall good. Very few complaints here, if anything, the score was a bit overused where dialogue should have done more heavy-lifting. Nothing that stood out as stellar, but nothing notably poor either.= Miditives:. As far as plot-holes go, nothing significant stood out to me other than a scene where a character delivers a gift to another immediately after parachuting down from a plane, and it wasn't readily apparent to me where this gift was stored in transit. There might have been a backpack or something else I missed in viewing, and it doesn't really affect the plot or characters either, so this might amount to nothing.. The English voice acting did not work for me. It often felt downright comical, detracting from the overall experience and hampering my suspension of disbelief.This might be due to the awkward delivery of native Urdu words in a light British accent, which felt unnatural. Those select few words aside, the voice acting often lacked emotional punch precisely where the narrative demanded it most.For people who don't speak Urdu, this might not be much of a problematic aspect.. The characters are what I care about most in almost any story I read/watch. And here the characters are simply... average. Simple characters with simple motivations. There is only one scene where character motivations and actions seemed misaligned, and while supernatural forces are somewhat implied to be at play, the writing is a bit shallow there.-Negatives:. Easily the weakest aspect of the movie was the writing itself. While there was clear ambition to tackle heavy themes, the execution fell short, particularly in the second half. The setup was decent, but the payoff was lacking.. The plot itself was just about par, with events happening to characters rather than being driven by them. Given the context of war and associated chaos, this is somewhat understandable, but the lack of cohesive flow between events made the slow pace feel even slower in the first half.. Non-linear storytelling is challenging to execute well with the best of creative teams, and it's usage here was mediocre, and overall a subtraction from the enjoyment of the film. The movie could have done without it.. Another thing the movie could have done without was the supernatural aspect of it, which was set-up repeatedly and emphasized, it's payoff(?) was simply absurd, and ended up harming the narrative rather than helping it. The one arm scene (which I suspect was supposed to be highly dramatic and an emotional low point) had me silently chuckling because of how absurd and contrived it was, simply undermining its intended effect.. The application of basic narrative tools (like cause and effect, and set-up and payoff) was often poor. Scene transitions had a very ""and then this happened"" quality to them rather than a ""and so this this happened"" one.. The ending, typically a time for resolving major plotlines and bringing the narrative together, was conveyed messily and felt farcical. In an attempt to subvert expectations and add a twist to the tale at the end, the narrative sort of fell apart and hampered my experience greatly.When the end credits rolled, the reactions of a lot of people in my theatre were something along the lines of ""Huh, what was that?"" In fact, one of the people I watched it with simply missed the twist part of the ending completely because of how little focus the movie gave to it and how little a reaction the characters in the movie itself gave to the event.The 'twist' was just not well delivered. It was confusing. It did not resonate.. The film seemed overly ambitious in its thematic goals. The plot and themes felt tangentially connected but fundamentally misaligned, resulting in a bit of messy messaging, particularly at the end.It felt like 90% of the first 90% of the movie was a straightforward story about a young romance amongst family drama and the difficulties of war. But then the movie decided it's central theme and ending message would be some nuanced notion of a tragedy and about how the creative value of art gives meaning to what limited lives humans have.It was clunky, disjointed, and poorly conveyed.Overall:My overall score:. 5.4I'm a picky viewer, and negatives stand out to me much very easily. For reference here are the overall scores of three others I watched the movie with:. 8.0/10. 9.2/10. 7.0/10.",5.0,Greyfire_SHN,2024-07-26,7.0,12.0

The link to a game show, the wheel of truth too doesn't yield the desired impact. The more jokes they try to track, that much the film suffered. Exactly one joke worked for me organically and that features Dawid. When the stakes aren't high and the characters aren't too likable, the screenplay expects a lot of from the audience to be lenient.

Unexpectedly, he prepares a last game to test their reconciliation and teamwork.CastNot familiar with anyone involved however Joanna Trzepiecinska was great here.VerdictI'm not sure how I got around to watching this, it was my pick for movie night and I was rather tired and eager to get started.Immediately I saw charm, everything looked fantastic and the house that this is set in? Magnificent. It came across quirky, goofy (In a good way) and I was curious where it was going to go.Well let's be clear this is a family film and certainly not a competent murder mystery. It's hard to pigeon hole, but if forced I'd simply say it's a comedy but simply not a very funny one.The characters are mostly annoying, the quirkiness only goes so far and the payoff is so lackluster it's hard to forgive and that's assuming you can get over how silly the entire premise is anyway.Inheritance is a harmless watch, but expect it to slip your mind in mere moments never to return.RantsThe best thing to come out of this is I at least got another film added to my Top 10 Polish movies list, because at time of writing I still only have 4!

1279433,No summary,"""Inheritance,"" directed by Sylwester Jakimow and now streaming on Netflix, attempts to blend the intrigue of a murder mystery with the quirks of a dark family comedy. Despite its ambitious premise, the film falls short in delivering a compelling narrative. The story revolves around the eccentric Fortuna family, who gather at their wealthy uncle Wladyslaw's mansion for the reading of his will, only to discover he has faked his death to bring them together. The real chaos begins when Wladyslaw is actually murdered, setting off a whodunnit mystery.While ""Inheritance"" shows potential with its initial setup and ensemble cast, it quickly becomes mired in predictability. The film adheres closely to the standard tropes of the genre without offering any fresh twists or surprises. The characters, though quirky, lack depth, making it difficult for the audience to invest in their individual stories or the overarching plot. The humor, which shifts from dry to slapstick, is uneven and often falls flat.The film's execution fails to capitalize on its unique elements, such as the game show-themed tasks designed by Wladyslaw to promote family bonding. Instead of adding layers to the narrative, these elements feel like missed opportunities, contributing little to character development or plot progression. The investigation into the murder, which should be the film's focal point, is lackluster and secondary to the forced comedic moments and repetitive emphasis on family reconciliation.Despite some positive aspects, such as the strong set design and occasional humorous scenes, ""Inheritance"" ultimately does not deliver a satisfying experience. Its predictable storyline and lack of character depth result in a film that is more tedious than engaging. For these reasons, ""Inheritance"" earns a score of 4 out 10.",3.0,doyler79,2024-07-17,1.0,1.0

The movie was generally a generic film, but it did have a couple unique things to it, and with the whole premise as a whole, it had amazing potential to be a classic with sequels in the making.

Yet, a person who is fully aware the death of the loved ones, struggles between wanting to provide the comfort and at the same time wanting the other person to face the reality.Tae-joo's virtual existence does not only bring comfort to Jeong-in, ""he"" also makes her relying on him. It makes it hard for Jeong-in to know what she really wants when she is challenged to make a choice.Above the moral issues that provoke me as a viewer, I like how the director presented the stories.

Her scenes with Gong Yoo, however, disappointed me. I'm not sure if it was down to them both acting in English but for 2 usually outstanding actor, the scenes were very stilted and awkward.I think South Korea needs to go back to using chemistry auditions instead of just casting big names, and then hoping it will work.

I'm not really the type of person who makes reviews after watching a drama, but this one is exceptional. ✨First, I want to express my gratitude to everyone involved in making this film-the actors, the crew, the staff, and the director. Your work has created something truly wonderful. 😍💞I was particularly struck by Gong Yoo's appearance. I missed seeing him in a drama, and his performance was a welcome return. 🌹Choi Woo Shik also impressed me greatly. I've been a fan since ""The Witch,"" and his talent continues to shine. 💕Park Bo Gum, with his mesmerizing puppy eyes, was another highlight. His performance captivated me and added so much to the drama. 🌼✨Bae Suzy, the nation's first love, once again proved her incredible acting skills. Her visuals and performance were stunning. She's always been my favorite actress. ❣🤗The dynamic between Park Bo-gum and Suzy was a major strength of the film. Their on-screen partnership felt natural and compelling, making me wish for more projects featuring them together in the future. 🤞The actors brought their characters to life beautifully, and the storyline was deeply engaging. It explores the fascinating and somewhat unsettling concept of AI, highlighting how we might cling to the memory of loved ones even after they are gone.I understand the desire to hold on to memories, even if they're not real. It makes me reflect on my own loved ones. Life teaches us to let go because holding on can lead to more pain.Yet, I believe we will reunite with those we've lost in Heaven, as promised by God. By believing, repenting, and accepting Him as our Lord & Savior, we find hope through faith and grace. 💗✨Tang Wei's performance was especially moving. The airport scene was heartbreaking and powerful. The realization of being gone and accepting it was portrayed with such depth. 😞The young girl's longing for her mother was profoundly touching. Her innocence and hope broke my heart. 💔I highly recommend this film for its emotional depth and the standout performances of the actors. It's a moving experience that will leave a lasting impression. 💝😊Thank you to everyone who contributed to this masterpiece. 💓☺",10.0,vielevenie,2024-07-26,8.0,13.0

This is a realization that someday AI might do more than humans since humans have the most control over developing progressive AI inventions. However, despite the rise of advanced technologies and the use of artificial intelligence, it cannot replace the deepest and innermost longings of human beings. There are just some things that AI cannot do, which only humans can. Nonetheless, artificial intelligence is a big help to us, but it has its own limits that we should be aware of and use properly.

The trailer promises an engaging narrative, but the actual film delivers something entirely different, creating a sense of betrayal for those who anticipated a compelling story.Sakib Khan's character, who could have been a layered and complex protagonist, instead comes across as a senselessly violent figure. The movie is filled with scenes where he kills people without any clear motivation or reason, making it difficult to connect with or understand his actions. This lack of depth in character development is a significant flaw that detracts from the overall experience.The discrepancies between the trailer and the main movie are glaring. While the trailer hinted at an action-packed yet coherent storyline, the film itself is a chaotic mess, with scenes that seem to exist solely for shock value rather than to advance the plot.

The second half is more interesting, especially the hospital scene, which is outside the park. I have never seen this type of content on BD. Thanks to Raihan Rafi for creating this type of content. Thanks for using Shakib Khan. This way. This man proved that if anyone can use him properly, he has the guts to give his best output. As far as I remember, the last time I saw Aynabaji in the theater. Now, Toofan. It was an incredible experience. A little bit more was expected from Chanchal, but he was quite impressed when he came on screen. The heroine's entry was very normal; it could be better. Shakib Khan's innocent part was good for the movie's build, and Toofan's swag, aggression, attitude, and dialogue are very good. It's good to see Habib's song; it's perfect. Also, all the songs are already chartbusters. Climax for the first part, it was good. I hope Toofan 2 will surpass this one; T2 will be bigger than T1. In the post-credits scene, I was waiting for the main villain, but it was a really unexpected twist. This type of cinema we saw in Bollywood and Tamil Telegu. But BD Industry did this for the first time with a unique story; some scenes were inspired but not similar. The Reborn of Shakib Khan is really appreciated, and we hope he will produce this type of good content.

1216385,No summary,"""Toofan"" presents a promising plot for Bangladeshi cinema. Megastar Shakib Khan, along with Mimi (from Kolkata) and Nabila, have given their best efforts under the direction of Raihan Rafi. While the first half is average, the second half is quite thrilling and maintains a fast pace.As a director, Raihan Rafi has certainly put in his best effort. However, when compared to global cinema, the plot lacks the 'wow' factor. ""Toofan"" weaves a story of twists, crime, and political violence. Unfortunately, Shakib Khan tends to overact when a more restrained performance would suffice. In contrast, actors like Salauddin Lavlu, Misha Sawdagor, Gazi Rakayet, Shahiduzzaman Selim, and Chanchal Chowdhury are known for their natural and method acting in Bangladesh. Despite involving many talented actors, Raihan Rafi did not manage to showcase everyone's skills to their fullest.From a technical standpoint, some of the background music seems to be copied or inspired by recently released Hindi movies. The film features only two original songs. Additionally, the storyline has several loopholes.On a positive note, the camera work and cinematography are commendable, thanks to Tahsin Rahman's efforts.Overall, ""Toofan"" is a decent effort and a good start for Bangladeshi cinema. It's a commercial film that you can enjoy with family and friends in the theatre.

From the poorly constructed plot to the lackluster performances, this movie failed to deliver on almost every front.The storyline was clichéd and predictable, with no real depth or innovation. It felt like the writers were recycling old tropes rather than crafting something fresh and engaging. The pacing was painfully slow, making it a struggle to stay engaged throughout the film.The acting was equally underwhelming. The lead actors seemed to sleepwalk through their roles, lacking any real passion or chemistry. Even the usually reliable supporting cast couldn't salvage the film, as they were given little to work with in terms of character development.The direction and cinematography were subpar. There were glaring inconsistencies and technical flaws that made it clear the production was rushed. The editing was choppy, with abrupt scene transitions that disrupted the flow of the movie.Moreover, the music, which is often a highlight in Bangla films, was forgettable and failed to enhance the narrative in any meaningful way.Overall, *toofan* was a huge letdown.

Usually Hollywood, Bollywood movies are watched online or downloaded on mobile-laptop.Sometimes quality Bengali movies like Ayanabaji, Hawa, Suranga or Rajkumar are seen in OTT.I was supposed to go to the cinema for the first time by watching the movie Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, which was released last March, but for various reasons it did not happen.But due to the interest generated after seeing the poster, teaser, title track, trailer etc. Of Tufan movie.I went to see the movie today on silver screen. The expectation while going was that I was going to watch Bengali movies of traditional quality seen online, no Hollywood, Indian or Korean movies.But believe me, while watching the movie, I never felt like I was watching a Bengali movie. And after the end of the movie, I was just wondering what I saw! Usually after watching a high-quality Hollywood movie, I get lost in thought for a while, with various questions running through my mind. But this happened to me in this first Bengali movie too.Not only that,
The first time I went to the cinema, that too to watch a Bengali movie, I left the cinema and decided to go to the cinema again to watch this movie. Because when it is released later in OTT, you can't bear to watch it a second time.Until now, when the topic of other Bengali movies came up except for a handful of two, I felt ashamed of myself, which movies were these, if I compared them with Hollywood, Bollywood or South movies, I thought ""Kai Agartala and Kai Chowkirtala"". But after watching this movie I have no hesitation to proudly say that it is our Bengali cinema.I took a friend with me to watch the movie, who does not watch Bengali movies, let alone Hollywood movies, from any other industry.That friend, whenever Shakib Khan came on screen and showed his swag, acting, expression game, he was just watching. To tell the truth, despite not being a devoted fan of Shakib Khan at that time, I knew why I felt proud of myself, thinking that yes, he is the superstar of our country.However, this movie also has some flaws and limitations. That is what happens in the movie Maximum. But it would be unfair not to appreciate all the other great points for those minor points.Many thanks to director Raihan Rafi for making such a beautiful movie on such a low budget and for presenting Shakib Khan in this way.It can be said that a revolution took place in the Bengali cinema industry through this movie.

The movie maintains a relentless pace, weaving its narrative with impactful action sequences that are heightened by the presence of genuine emotion.**Music and Score (8/10):* While the movie's songs may not be its strongest suit, the background music is stellar. It enhances crucial scenes, adding depth and intensity to the storytelling. The score elevates the overall quality of the film. But I missed singer Asif Akbar's golden voice!**Balancing Action and Emotion (9/10): 'Toofan' finds the delicate equilibrium between high-octane action and heartfelt emotion. This unique blend not only entertains but also gives depth to the action sequences, making them more resonant with the audience. It's evident that the filmmakers aimed to create an action film with a heart, and they succeeded in doing so.**Addressing Social and Political Issues (9/10):* The film takes a bold step by addressing pressing social and political concerns. What's notable is its impartial approach; ""Toofan"" isn't politically biased but instead scrutinizes the systemic flaws ingrained in our society. This choice ensures that its message remains universally relevant.**Pacing and Emotional Depth (7/10):** While the movie's fast tempo adds to its excitement, it occasionally hampers the emotional depth of certain scenes. Slowing down at times could have allowed for more profound exploration of the characters' feelings and experiences. Nonetheless, the film manages to forge a connection between the audience and its characters.**Cinematic Brilliance (9/10):* Visually, 'Toofan' is a work of art. The cinematography is nothing short of exceptional, immersing viewers in a visually captivating world. The film's stunning visuals contribute significantly to its overall allure, making it a cinematic treat.**Outstanding Performances (9.5/10):* Shakib Khan delivers a remarkable performance that steals the show. His portrayal is compelling and authentic, adding layers to his character.

It successfully navigates the terrain of action and emotion, offering audiences a unique cinematic experience.

1216385,No summary,"""Toofan"" is a standout film that breaks away from the conventions typically seen in Bengali cinema, offering a fresh perspective in both its narrative and cinematography. Directed by Raihan Rafi, the film is an impressive feat, especially considering its modest budget. Rafi's directorial prowess makes ""Toofan"" appear comparable to high-budget North Indian films.Shakib Khan delivers an exceptional performance, showcasing his versatility and proving his acting capabilities. The action sequences are seamlessly edited, a rarity in contemporary Bangladeshi films. One of the most remarkable moments is a 3-4 minute single-take rescue scene, which is executed with precision and intensity. The characters and their dialogues are nearly flawless, capturing the essence of a gangster's demeanor with authenticity.The production design effectively transports viewers to a 1990s setting, enhanced by top-tier editing, cinematography, and color grading. These elements collectively elevate ""Toofan"" to a high standard of filmmaking.However, the film is not without its shortcomings. The backstory of the titular character, ""Toofan,"" lacks sufficient screen time, which diminishes its impact. Additionally, some scenes feel more like trailers rather than integral parts of the narrative. A specific scene could have benefitted from a single-take approach, similar to the aforementioned rescue sequence.Overall, ""Toofan"" is a 10/10, primarily due to its exceptional direction, cinematography, and production quality. The ending and post-credit scenes are particularly noteworthy, adding a memorable conclusion to the film.",10.0,siamhyder,2024-06-18,4.0,3.0

Multicasting of several legendary actors from Bengali film industry worked really well as it attracts both mass and class people at the same time.

1216385,No summary,"""Toofan"" breaks the Shakib Khan mold with a captivating action-thriller that will leave you on the edge of your seat. Raihan Rafi's directorial magic shines through in this unique and engaging storyline set in the 90s.The movie is a far cry from typical love stories, delving into complex themes that require a keen eye to follow. Witty dialogues and well-developed characters further enhance the experience. While the beginning may leave you intrigued about the movie's direction, the storyline gradually unfolds, transporting you to the 90s era with world-class cinematography.A particular standout is the breathtaking scene where Toofan rescues his foster father, showcasing the movie's action-packed thrills. For those unfamiliar with Shakib Khan, this movie serves as a fantastic introduction to his talent, as he delivers a relatable and impressive performance. However, it's Mimi Chakraborty who steals the show with her mind-blowing acting skills, elevating her character to new heights.The supporting cast, including Chanchal Chowdhury and Shahiduzzaman Selim, also deliver commendable performances, adding depth to the narrative. While some elements may seem familiar, the underlying story remains unique and fresh.If you're craving an action-packed thriller, ""Toofan"" is an absolute must-watch.

1290377,No summary,"""Come Closer"" by Tom Nesher was one of the most prominent Israeli films presented at many festivals and screenings, and the hype for it was real. Therefore, I came with high expectations for a very high-quality film, and I was not disappointed in the slightest. In fact, I believe it's one of the best and most important Israeli films of recent years, and I highly recommend watching it.In the lead role, Lia Elalouf, appearing for the first time on a feature film, portrays one of the most complex and emotionally charged characters I've seen in recent times, especially in Israeli cinema. The recent Ophir Award winner (for her first cinematic role!) delivered an amazing performance, showcasing the character's complex emotions and unique personality in an extraordinary way.Also making her debut on the big screen, Daria Rosen plays the supporting role in the film and delivers breathtaking acting that deeply impressed me. She too received a nomination for the Ophir Award (again, impressively for a first film role), and it's certainly deserved. With a character somewhat opposite in personality to Elalouf's, she also succeeds in presenting complex emotions and internal conflicts in an amazing yet fundamentally different way, offering another perspective on coping with grief after the loss of a loved one. Together, Elalouf and Rosen lead the film as the professionals they are and serve as its beating heart, as well as the heart of the story it seeks to convey.Without spoiling or delving into specific plot details, just a quick glance at the film's synopsis shows that it deals with a very painful and difficult subject, and in my opinion, it successfully handles this task. The film is deeply moving, and I believe that Tom Nesher's script, which she says is based on ""real emotion,"" conveys this emotion beautifully, personally and intimately through the camera lens. As mentioned, the lead actresses carry the film, but they do not do so without being supported by a talented crew in cinematography, editing, costumes, set design, and more. The musical choices often take the viewer by surprise with impressive contrasts to what's happening on screen (in a positive and refreshing way) and add another layer to the viewing experience. The original score composed for the film is also moving and serves as a wonderful and essential addition.Tom Nesher, in her first full-length feature film, masterfully orchestrates the process in what feels like the work of a seasoned filmmaker. Her true talent is evident in every moment on screen-in both writing and directing. It feels grand yet also intimate and focused at the same time. The film's Ophir Award win is well-deserved, and Tom Nesher is emerging as a brilliant filmmaker, with the Israeli film industry's eyes on her as one of the most promising names of recent years. It's no surprise when I say I foresee a bright future for her in her career, and this is undoubtedly just the beginning.""Come Closer"" is a powerful and gripping Israeli creation, and one of the best films made in the country in recent years. It's hard to miss the film's sweeping success at festivals and award ceremonies, and it's always exciting to see this happen for a film that so fully deserves it. I highly recommend going to see it and experiencing one of the most unique stories presented on screen in recent years, and supporting a work that I'm proud to see representing Israel at the Oscars and various other international award ceremonies. As a joint creation led by Nesher, Elalouf, and Rosen, this is a stirring experience and a very brave film-may there be more like it in Israeli cinema.",7.0,Dvir971,2024-09-18,5.0,3.0
1290377,No summary,"A highly visible elephant in the room here is the accidental death of writer/director Tom Nesher's teenage brother, who was the son of one of Israel's most prominent moviemakers. At a preview screening, Tom Nesher noted that one incident the movie reproduces from real life is that after the fatal accident, the dead boy's sister looks through his belongings in hopes of finding some surprise. In real life, she didn't fine one, but in the movie she does. It turns out he had a serious girlfriend. (If you saw ""The Cakemaker,"" you may guess what's coming.)The character who, as the sister, is Tom Nesher's counterpart (yes, Tom Nesher is a woman) is, does not, we may be thankful, represent an idealized version of Nesher herself. In fact, she is not very likeable, and since she is the protagonist, the movie is a bit the harder to enjoy until we become reconciled to her. Although she's said to have been very close to her brother, there's not much material to demonstrate their closeness and thus win the audience's sympathy before the accident occurs.As the movie progresses, the sister and the previously unknown girlfriend help one another, or exploit one another, in the attempt to retain the boy somehow as part of their lives. Nesher says she spent a lot of time preparing the actresses, and she incorporated contributions from them-- partly because as a former newsperson she believes in the importance of background. And the effort paid off with awards at Tribeca and in Jerusalem.",8.0,Nozz,2024-08-10,2.0,3.0

1291143,No summary,"I really enjoyed this documentary. It's not often a documentary directly recruits the perpetrators to explain their side of the story, and it's even rarer where you end up routing for the bad guys. What's unique about this doc is that it really explains how these group of bank robbers were not hardened criminals but rather an eclectic group of educated misfits, and used their smarts to, well, outsmart the banks and the cops and eventually FBI for so long.What's also nice is that this doc is very honest. The cops made mistakes. They aren't perfect and they aren't exactly Americas brightest (only need a high school degree and a few weeks of training to be a cop). They also got very trigger happy in the end. These robbers were yes, robbers. But they never hurt anyone. They never shot anyone. Never hit them, never took hostages etc. However the police and by extension the feds really wanted to scare the banks/public into thinking Hollywood was this violent unhinged monster just waiting to snap in the hopes they would get tips coming in as to who these guys were, when all evidence contradicted this notion. They end up having a shoot out against guys with jammed guns, lying that they shot first. You can't fire an unloaded or jammed weapon... so how could they ""shoot first"". Then the story changed to, ""we saw them carrying a rifle in the van's rear window"" despite them clearly stating numerous times the windows we blacked out and you could not look through any of the windows except the front windshield...Then when one of the robbers offs themselves, the police then fire 76 freaking rounds into the corpse. Absolutely disgusting. What isn't stated in this documentary (but stated in other videos, look it up) is that a by standard got hit from the police reckless, excessive rounds.Great documentary. Definitely very cool to learn how these guys planned their heists and strategized to evade the police for long.",8.0,ShadowsBeneathTheLight,2024-06-30,5.0,3.0
1291143,No summary,"True crime doc based on a string of bank robberies in 90s Seattle, this is a decent show coming in at 86 mins. Anything more would have been too drawn out, glad they decided not to go the three episode route with this story.There's not much to watch visually; while there are some old clips and photos used, the doc mainly uses old audio and interviews from the present time. Several motion posters have also been used. So, you can either play it in the background or if you'd rather 'watch this as a podcast', that'll work too. If you have 1.5 hrs to spare and aren't sure what watch as a true crime content enthusiast, this should be on your list.I wonder if Netflix true crime docs are all beginning to look and sound the same.",6.0,TreeFiddy53,2024-06-18,6.0,3.0

But no, they reveal who did it within 8 minutes of the documentary after a bunch of superfluous meandering, like immaterial detective interpersonal quarrels and Nivarna's grunge influence. Even if these side stories would somehow fit in this movie, it was done poorly and jarringly.There is a story in there somewhere, but these filmmakers didn't figure out what it was or how to tell it. I honestly don't know what the point of this film was. Somewhat of a story didn't start until 25 min into. In fact some of the story at around 34 min into should have been used in the beginning of the film to build the character of Scott.The whole story should have been re-edited to start with all the robberies, then figuring out who did it, then learn about his lifestyle, background etc..

The true reality of life for those outcasts living in the favelas, Brazilian ghettos. The main female character is of course interesting, powerful. It may be seen as a kind of biopic told in the Martin Scorcese's manner: GOOD FELLLAS or A BRONX TALE - directed by Bob De Niro but under Scorcese's inspiration. So, yes, this cheap Brazilian production is worth the watch, but it is not destined to any audiences. There is no beautiful chicks in bikini snooping around swimming pools and drinking daiquiris, no sunshine and golden sands beaches, romance, This is not like a series from Mexico about a female drug ring kingpin for whom the sun always shines....

But chose to do it..it is very respectful of Scott, pretty celebratory, too celebratory I personally think. It makes all the agency about him, not his accomplices. It feels uncomfortable the way it seems to celebrate what they all did because they are white, from 'good families ', attractive. It was still bank robberies. People were traumatised and in danger. That gets mentioned briefly towards the end but most of it ignores that. It is very interesting how a narrative can tell a story and influence your views of someone. In this he is almost a hero, being free, living his life. But also Robbing people of their's with the trauma. I'm not perfect, I don't know what I'd do in any situation..I know what is hope I'd do. And I work with people who have done things seen as worse or not as bad. I work with ex prisoners, current prisoners and vulnerable people and it's interesting that with a lot of those people I get the privilege and joy of seeing them as a human being, their strengths and hopes, resilience and circumstances. And the role of trauma and circumstances in the situations we find ourselves in. We are given that here. But we are not given the view of the victims who I also should remember in my work. And in this documentary. We are however given the view of his family. Who were respectfully represented here. But I wonder how this could have been presented had Scott been a black male, maybe an asylum seeker. The drug dealing is almost skipped over, his mental health is presented in a very different way to how it would be if it was someone else. The nudity. The weapons. This would have been very different had he been poor, ethnic minority, a refugee. And quite probably in what would be considered more dire circumstances.",5.0,ccreviewingtime,2024-06-15,4.0,8.0

While I think this is a valuable conversation to have, I don't believe this film is part of the problem. I think How to Rob a Bank does a very good job of holding Scott and his accomplices accountable; bank robbery is not a victimless crime and this is told to us directly through interviews with the victims themselves. Additionally, Scott's accomplices express deep regret at the path their lives took, the crimes they committed, and the people they hurt.

it was really tough watching this movie. The movie was too long and a lot of things didn't make sense. They robbed the drug dealer to get money for the girl's treatment but you can see they only got his drug stash, which they would have to resell. All of a sudden they have the money for the treatment. The son hides the truck in a junkyard and throws the plates and confererate flag away near the truck. First place police would look for a missing vehicle. The sheriff is thinking of shooting her deputy but would be using her service pistol--first ballistics check law enforcement would be checking.

1279642,No summary,"Greetings again from the darkness. Historically, we've been treated to Western movies that were heavy on tense gunfights and macho morality ... white hats vs black hats. However, if you've been paying attention these past few years, you've likely noticed a shift in tone. Westerns have become more attuned to the sensibilities of real people, and less enamored with quick-draws. This may be the directorial debut of writer-director Jake Allyn, but it's not his first rodeo (couldn't resist). Allyn wrote the screenplay and starred in NO MAN'S LAND (2020), which was directed by his brother Conor. For this film, he co-wrote the screenplay with Josh Plasse, his co-star in ""The Baxters"". Both men also play brothers here.A grizzled C Thomas Howell (contrasted with his fresh-faced Ponyboy in THE OUTSIDERS, 1983) stars as John Hawkins, a former rodeo star, who walked away from his career when his wife Monica (Annabeth Gish, MYSTIC PIZZA, 1988), now the local Sheriff, birthed the first of their three kids. Son Noah (co-writer Plasse) is a clean-cut, straight arrow young man who has steered away from the bull riding tradition set by his father, his grandfather Al (Forrie J Smith, ""Yellowstone""), and his brother Peter (director Allyn). Early on, we see Peter, now the black sheep of the family, being released after a four-year prison sentence. Most of the urgent attention is paid to eleven-year-old Virginia (Zia Carlock), whose cancer can only be treated at a specialty oncology center. This life-saving treatment comes with a $160,000 price tag and a financial and emotional burden on her father John that may be more than he can handle.One of the first things to notice about this is how beautifully it's filmed by cinematographer Keith J Leman. The rodeo scenes are particularly striking as nothing is overdone or over-dramatized. John and Peter struggle to re-connect, but it's Virginia's treatment that helps the two stubborn men find common ground. Either would do whatever necessary to save her. For John, this means begging the bank for another loan, selling off his beloved horses, and finally coming to grips with the need to break the moral code by which he has always lived his life. Peter's drug habit provides an opportunity, and of course, things don't go according to plan. Soon, Sheriff Monica is working a case that may force her into her own moral choice between family and the law. Simultaneously, Deputy Dickons (Scott Reeves), who is clearly a bit too close to his boss, is eager to bring down John and Peter.All of this takes place in Stephenville, Texas, known as the Cowboy Capitol of the world (although it's filmed in Tennessee). The '8 seconds' on a bull ride are stressed a few times, yet mostly what we have is a serious family drama filled with guilt and desperation. On the downside, the script doesn't quite meet the standard of the tone or acting. Some polishing could have elevated the entire film, and a bit less eyeliner on Allyn and reduced lipstick on young Carlock would have helped. Still, C Thomas Howell and Forrie J Smith are particularly excellent in their roles. The film makes an obvious statement on the health care and insurance industries, and the oft-repeated line, ""I'm praying for you"" is meant to sound as hollow as the sentiment can sometimes come across. This is a world filmmaker and actor Allyn feels comfortable with, and he does a pretty nice job with it.In select theaters and ON DEMAND beginning June 14, 2024.",6.0,ferguson-6,2024-06-14,13.0,3.0

The songs can sometimes feel out of place as a movie based on the series. But that wouldn't be able to contain a simple yet enjoyable story, solid animation, characters that can stand up from the show, and some fun comedy. I know there may be some that have missed the times Disney Channel would release their animated films as their original movies. If you're one of those people or that you're a fan of the series, then this actually is the one worth watching. As Disney Channel original movies go, I wouldn't consider this a masterpiece.

If you care about humans who love animals, you'll especially appreciate the selflessness and sacrifices made by those who worked to save these animals.This is not much of a spoiler, but the name of the place isn't actually Checkpoint Zoo. Feldman Ecopark was in the middle of the early days of the unprovoked brutal full-scale war by russia against Ukraine. The name of the documentary will make sense when you watch it.Scattered humorous scenes and reflections after the fact contrast powerfully with the stark terror that the animals and their rescuers experienced. Those moments of relief are needed because the average viewer would probably be overwhelmed otherwise.I'm not sure if I'm an average viewer or not, but I'm crying as I write this a day after I saw it.Slava Ukraini

1247031,No summary,"It shows that it was never intended for the public and feeling the need to show this is why I stopped being a fan of Federer when he was okay with being called the goat.Young Federer was more a brat that had a real good touch. Federer later in his career was more calculated and what was called inn9vative is something what players much lower on the rankings tried out repeatedly. The short return for example is nothing new . Most off the time you see players go to the back to give themselves more time. The Downside to that is that you give the serving player more time. So by getting closer , relying on his touch. He took time away meaning that his returns shouldn't be as good as when he was more in the back.At the time Federer was being called the goat it was clear that Nadal was the greatest gravel player ever. And that he worked hard to adapt to other surfaces . And Djokovich was starting to catch up in titles on those two. Murray as a tennis player was really unlucky with them being in the same era when he played tennis. But I don't think he should be mentioned. It where those three ( federer, nadql and djokovich) and a couple of players below them but still at a very high level.He hept most of the time neutral on subjects, which sports player really should be, or artists , entertainers and certainly the press. Headed a rare exception on the brevity vote. I think it slipped his tongue. His neutrality is something that deserves my respect. Too many athletes particularly in the USA are misused for political and fina coal gains.Anyway as a tennis player , federer was especially early in his career a joy to watch. Later in his career he sometimes seemed disrespectful to his opponents. (And his rivals) his rivals seemed to the public fine with it. Although Djokovich started openly talking about winning the most grand slams. Which from an objective standpoint would mean he would be the greatest.You also should look at who your rivals are. Djokovic probably had the toughest time as he joined the nadal-federer rivalry later arguably playing the best two players at that ime wnd getting good results agaimst them.. And federer faced some players that were near the end of their career early on. And Nadal was no real force on other surfaces early on.. for example one of the finalists he beat I Australia was bwghdatis . While he was fun to watch, it is because the Australian open was not played by all players that he took some easier titles.Anyway back to the movie. I found the balance interview, bts and matches very bad. Editing was amateurish.If you are a fan of Federer I think it's okay, but rather it should be regarded as a document instead of a movie..

1247031,No summary,"""Federer's Last Twelve Days"" is an emotionally charged and inspiring documentary that delves into the final chapter of one of the greatest tennis careers ever. As someone who was introduced to tennis through Federer, this film resonated deeply with me. His influence not only turned me into an avid viewer but also inspired me to pick up a racket and play as an amateur.One of the most commendable aspects highlighted in the documentary is the unique camaraderie among the top players. Despite fierce rivalries, Federer, Murray, Nadal, and Djokovic have managed to maintain genuine friendships. This is particularly exemplified in the heartfelt moments shared between Federer and Nadal. While I knew they were friends, this documentary reveals the depth of their relationship, going beyond mere friendship to something more profound. Watching Nadal shed tears, arguably more than Federer himself, was incredibly touching and showcased the strong bond they share.The documentary also captures the unparalleled admiration people have for Federer. His charisma, sportsmanship, and the respect he commands from both fans and rivals are extraordinary. It is hard to imagine the tennis world ever seeing another player who is both so universally loved and respected.

He later co-produced the Boss's later albums before departing just as Bruce hit paydirt with the Born in the USA album.Stevie was not part of the lucrative Born in the USA touring band. Instead he got involved in political activism such as raising awareness about Apartheid in South Africa. It culminated in the supergroup Artists United Against Apartheid with the song Sun City. Although it was a minor hit, its impact was more felt in the USA.This documentary shows that Stevie actually had nice vocals in his younger days. He was soulful and an aficionado of rock, pop and rhythm and blues music and anything in between.He was a consigliere to Bruce, the most important member of the E Street Band.

1278112,No summary,I don't read this great review and bias and the fact that I'm a diehard Sopranos fan. But had I never seen the Sopranos I never would've heard of little Steve. I'm a 80s baby but growing up in my garage as a five-year-old kid my dad played the living sh$t out of Bruce Springsteen born in the USA. All that comes back all the nostalgia everything that Steve did in his career even the political stuff with South Africa was very reminiscent and even the sopranos being over 20 years ago it's amazing this guy's career. I don't think there's anybody on planet Earth that has much diversity with longevity of creative talent and abilities. Granted he's not the most successful musician Director or actor out there but the stuff that he's done is like miraculous.

1278112,No summary,"Greetings again from the darkness. The tagline is ""Artist. Activist. Renegade."", yet somehow after spending 2.5 hours watching this documentary from Bill Teck, we realize there is even more to Steve Van Zandt. Or maybe you know him as ""Miami Steve"" ... or even ""Little Steven"". Having accomplished so much through various avenues, we are left with nothing but respect for the man.Bruce Springsteen fans know him as Miami Steve of the East Street Band (and Bruce's longtime buddy). Other music lovers know him as the leader of Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul. Some remember him as the driving force behind the ""Sun City"" song and collaboration. Still others know him as an actor playing Tony's consigliere Silvio in ""The Sopranos"", or as a mobster in ""Lilyhammer"". What we learn is that he's also an incredibly talented songwriter, a highly sought-after producer and arranger, and he was the saving grace behind Springsteen's ""Tenth Avenue Freezeout"" on the breakout album. By any name, Van Zandt is not one to stand on his (many) past accomplishments.Documentarian Teck loosely breaks down the timeline of Van Zandt's life and, in keeping with the Disciple title, presents it in three 'Books': Salvation, Revolution, Revelations. Much of the run time is spent in Book I, where we recap the early days of Asbury Park, New Jersey, and local venue, The Stone Pony. Some incredible clips are included showing live performances of Southside Johnny, Van Zandt, and of course, Springsteen. It's also here where we learn the origin of the nickname ""Miami Steve"". It didn't take long for Van Zandt's extraordinary talent as an arranger to shine through, and his ambition and creative forces drove him to leave the E Street Band in 1983 to form his own identity. It's also in this stage where he married Maureen in a ceremony officiated by none other than music icon Little Richard (video), and including singer Percy Sledge.Book II recounts Steven's foray into activism and political activities, namely Apartheid in South Africa. He wrote the song ""Sun City"" and organized the iconic participants of the movement that ultimately contributed to the release of Nelson Mandela. As impressive as his efforts were, and as respected as he was, Van Zandt readily admitted, ""I don't want to be a politician.""
Aptly named Book III: Evolution took Van Zandt to 1999, where not only did he reconnect with Springsteen and rejoin the E Street Band, he also accepted creator David Chase's offer to take a role in ""The Sopranos"". That's a pretty good year. It's in Book IV: Revelations where Van Zandt originated his popular radio show, ""Little Steven's Underground Garage"", where he keeps rock history alive, and he also brought 1960's band The Rascals to Broadway. In 2021, Van Zandt's memoir, ""Unrequited Infatuations"" was published. Did I mention this isn't a man to sit back and chill?Bill Teck solidifies the admiration Van Zandt has by including interviews with the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney, Southside Johnny, Dion, Gary US Bonds, Mike Stoller, Darlene Love, wife Maureen, Peter Gabriel, Eddie Vedder, Bono, Joan Jett, Jackson Browne, Reuben Blades, Jon Landau, and David Chase. The interviews and clips and photographs are well done, plus he allows Van Zandt to contribute his own thoughts. This is terrific insight, and the film ends perfectly showing Bruce and Steve teaming up for ""No Surrender"".Airing on HBO and streaming on MAX beginning June 22, 2024.",7.0,ferguson-6,2024-06-20,17.0,2.0

Who knows, maybe some of them really happened, we can't know, but the events in this film were constructed quite realistically. The exaggeration was less. The timing of the jumpscares was quite good. There were many places that made me jump. Especially the makeup was insufficient in my opinion. Compared to the other films, the makeup was lighter. I can't say anything about the decor, but prosthetic makeup is very important in these works. I don't know if it was deliberately neglected, but it was not sufficient. The music was very good again. Apart from the script and makeup, nothing else caught my eye.Overall, it was a film where Islamic themes and realism were at the forefront.In my opinion, Orhan's struggle with the jinn was the breaking point of the film.

1125953,No summary,"Getting back in the dating scene after a long absence can be quite a challenge. With ever-changing conventions dictating what's acceptable and what's not these days, those who are out of practice can be left bewildered (especially those who were never particularly adept at modern-day courting to begin with). That's very much the case with João (Artur Volpi), who just broke up with his partner of 10 years. He's a nice guy, if a bit reserved and geeky, but certainly quite handsome and politely genial. Yet, even though he's certainly open to getting back into the dating game, the ambitious Brazilian filmmaker is actually most anxious to begin work on directing a new arthouse movie from his own script. However, just as the production is about to launch, his funding gets pulled, forcing him to retool the screenplay for a potential new would-be backer. But, as he's doing this, he develops writer's block, unsure what kind of story he wants to tell. So, to occupy his time as he sorts out this issue, he investigates new dating opportunities, many of which prove to be more boldly ""amorously assertive"" than he's accustomed to, revealing just how much he's out of touch with current dating practices than he realized. In fact, when ""hopeful"" suitors discover that he makes movies, they suggestively approach him to put his talents to use for chronicling their erotic escapades - not with him but with other more willing participants. So, with no income in hand and in need of money, João relents, taking his filmmaking work in a decidedly different (and personally embarrassing) new direction. But this path gets him no closer to career or romantic fulfillment. So what's he to do now? That's what he needs to find out for himself. However, as promising as this premise might sound for a gay romcom/outrageous sex farce, writer-director Daniel Ribeiro seriously drops the ball by committing the cardinal sin of moviemaking in this genre - creating a picture that's tediously dull. As this offering unfolds, it fails to generate giggles in either of the protagonist's hapless undertakings, areas that should be rife with potential for yielding sidesplitting laughs. What's more, for a movie that's supposed to be heavy on eroticism, this release contains some of the most boring on-screen sex I've ever seen (explicit though some of it may be). And the picture's lame attempts at incorporating supposedly creative narrative twists and more serious subject matter largely fall even flatter than its other failed material. The result is a finished product that fails to take advantage of the innate strengths it should have had going for it. It's little more than a tiresome, uninteresting slog that seems far longer than its 1:40:00 runtime - and a seriously missed opportunity to make what easily could have been an admittedly cheeky but nevertheless uproariously funny comedy. So much for the perfect endings.",1.0,brentsbulletinboard,2024-09-29,0.0,1.0
1125953,No summary,"The film endeavors to be endearing, and it is only fair to acknowledge that it succeeds in this regard. It is, indeed, a charming film. The protagonist possesses sufficient charisma to engage the audience, fostering a sense of attachment. However, if this was the film's primary ambition, it is a rather modest one.Ultimately, the film emerges as another project that prompts discussions about its unrealized potential. The principal flaw, in my opinion, lies within the script. Crafting dialogues for a specific group, complete with their unique slang, catchphrases, syntactic structures, and onomatopoeia, is a formidable task. However, the script's shortcomings are not confined to this aspect alone. The dialogues lack depth and are superficial, failing to provide any meaningful insight into the characters. The supporting characters serve merely as ornamental props, and even the protagonist is portrayed as shallow and unremarkable. The narrative, in the end, is more trivial than endearing. While the film does identify intriguing dilemmas faced by a white gay man in São Paulo, it addresses them in such a sterile, artificial, and uninspiring manner that it seems like an antiseptic portrayal of a complex reality.Possibly due to the script, the performances at times appear awkward. Certain dialogues between the trio of friends become cringe-inducing due to the weak writing. The attempt to represent a specific group of young people from São Paulo ends up feeling like a caricature verging on the comedic. We learn very little about any of the characters, other than their professions in cinema and their habit of drinking coffee. Their primary dilemma is their struggle with relationships-a rather universal issue.Furthermore, it is almost imperative for any film set in São Paulo to exhibit visual beauty, necessitating proficient cinematography. However, this film manages to be aesthetically displeasing in both its photography and art direction. With few exceptions, the film fails to capture the city's visual allure, which, in my opinion, is yet another flaw attributable to the script. The city's chaos is dialectically intertwined with each character's inner turmoil. Daily routines such as cohabitation, waking early, visiting cafes, shopping at markets, attending the cinema, and returning from trips-all these events occur within a space-time framework that is not integrated into the story. When time is incorporated, it is through an unsuccessful attempt to explore various possible realities.In conclusion, I finished watching the film without understanding what the ""13 feelings"" refer to.",3.0,heltersonrsl,2024-06-15,1.0,1.0

But consider this: in an era of youtube ""explainers"" (disguised as documentaries) where the visuals guide the narration and where there's an unnecessary amount of ""so this is..."", ""look at this..."" , ""and now we are going to..."" wild wild space is actually a solid, old school, beautiful documentary that requires the audience to put in a bit of effort to appreciate the whole thing.(I admit I had to watch twice to digest it)Thematic, not character driven. Yes we follow 3 CEOs/founders of 3 startups meant to send rockets and satellites in the sky (and ideally make money in the process) and yes their personalities and actions may represent different shades of humanity... but the background color is pretty much the same: ambition.I do think it is intentional: everything related to the 3 guys has to slowly fade away to leave space (pun intended) to the thematic train of this ambitious work, smartly introduced in the title. The outer space as the last frontier is a wild wild space where everything is possible like in the old days and big fortune are just around the corner. It's a wild wild space ladies and gentlemen. Or... is it?Not really: the funding needed, the crazy scientific know how, the various government' agencies... it's all but a no man's land where the fastest and the strongest and the luckiest can get their share of the pie. It's a highly regulated game that only those in the known can eventually have access to it, even though it will affect the rest of humanity.The main obstacle for the contemporary minds (affected by high fast editing + in your face exposition) is exactly this: we drift away from the characters to get to the core of it: space and who runs the show.Editing is excellent, loved the pacing. Not sure if it's because of the nature of the subject matter (you know build a rocket slowly and then booom go up in space) but the way it floes is one of the most enjoyable experiences on screen in a while.Remarkable the fact that the filming crew followed the CEOs and whatnot for several years. Congrats for the dedication.Sotrywise good job deciding to not include any technical jargon and so on.

1283214,No summary,"This film set out to be comprehensive and engaging to the average viewer and IMHO succeeds on those terms. The you-are-there vibe is really quite good. You can vicariously get a feeling for what working at a rocket start-up might be like (I was in one briefly MANY years ago).One observation is that the extreme visionary approaches tend to succeed. Peter Beck of Rocket Labs saw an opportunity and went for it; he (initially) envisioned smaller rockets than SpaceX at a reasonable cost (but with outstanding quality). Peter didn't let his lack of formal training stop him; he seems to be a of force of intellect -- interesting guy.Planet Labs went for ultra-small low-cost satellites; in their initial experiments they used cell-phones as the payloads! They're a great example of *evolutionary* engineering, whereas SpaceX often does *revolutionary* engineering.Chris Kemp at Astra Space seemed to believe he would be a player in this ""space"" (no pun) by sheer force of will. He's persuasive, but the company seemed to have a ""me too"" approach -- they wanted to be like Rocket Labs but cheaper. There didn't seem to be more to the business plan than that.The movie does an excellent job of showing the evolution of these companies and how things worked out for them (it wasn't all good BTW). HOWEVER, the film doesn't go into technical details, such as WHY things went wrong; we're simply told things like an engine didn't fire (or cut off too soon).This is a seven-star film for casual viewers, and probably a six-star film for those with relevant engineering skills (who might have appreciated a few more details). That's 6.5 stars overall, but I'm rounding down to six (6) stars due to some inaccurate statements about the impact of the Kessler Effect (which wouldn't prevent launches to higher orbits or other planets if it occurred).",6.0,Norman_French,2024-07-25,2.0,1.0
1283214,No summary,"I hope I didn't put off some potential viewers for using the term ""long-term (business) documentary"" right away in my headline.Let me assure you, this documentary - basically following three US-based 'new space' start-up companies - isn't boring at all. Some of the main characters in the film are so colorful that you could be fooled into thinking that you watch a fictional movie, not a documentary.A little bit of background first: Ashlee Vance (also heavily involved and briefly featured in the documentary himself) is a business journalist who wrote a book on new space companies and started filming and interviewing executives as well as academics involved in the space and rocket sectors around the same time.(I read his book before watching WWS, but this is not a requirement at all. You may even enjoy more surprises watching it without having read his book first - otherwise a few spoilers are obviously revealed in the book already.)Some readers may be vaguely familiar with Ashlee Vance's name because he was the first to write a biography on Elon Musk - who in turn started one of first private space companies in a Western country (SpaceX).This documentary and his book only feature SpaceX and other pioneering rocket companies started by fellow billionaires and rivals (Jeff Bezos, Paul Allen, Richard Branson etc.) in passing.The main focus of WWS are ""normal"" (they are anything but normal in all other aspects, trust me) entrepreneurs. Ambitious people who followed in the foot-steps of these business moguls and tried to (and are still trying to) launch space ventures thanks to third-party funding. It goes without saying that most of these companies require billions of dollars until they maybe have a chance to break even and stand on their own feet. As is repeatedly said or allured to in the film: ""Space is (very) hard"". This is true both in terms of technology and funding.Speaking of money: Ashlee Vance - having toured the globe visiting space companies in places like New Zealand, French Guiana, Ukraine, Russia and the U. S. - noticed that his funds for the project were running low and started to get outside help to focus/improve the script and finally finish the documentary by 2024.What was once intended as an entire series was cut into one single documentary. His new partners (experienced in the movie sector, eg. Ross Kauffman with an Academy Award for Best Documentary under his belt) in the project also advised him to focus on just a handful of companies.WWS therefore follows three space start-ups in detail, namely Astra, Planet Labs and Rocket Lab (with a particular focus on the CEO of each venture).I think it is a much better movie for it, because there's an emotional attachment for the viewer thanks to this focus. The main characters at each of three companies really spring to life. The completely opposite characters and business approaches of two of the CEOs involved (namely Chris Kemp of Astra and Peter Beck of Rocket Lab) already make the entire documentary worth watching.The movie offers very detailed and generous insights into all three companies. The filmmakers got access to calls with investors and even the rocket launch sequences inside the mission control rooms - including nerve-wrecking setbacks and failures - as well as the IPOs of all three companies on the public stock market.From bedrooms and garage operations with tinkerers - to billions in funding, taking over government launchpads and hiring hundreds of employees. A story of rags to riches. And back to zero in some cases (Space is hard...remember).I can only recall seeing very few business-related documentaries where external observers got such an intimate access over long periods of time (the three companies are covered from about 2016/2017 until early 2024, with older material mixed in from the company archives and other sources).The documentary reveals how the grip on space and rockets has shifted from national states, bureaucratic organizations (like NASA) and their long-term suppliers (often huge companies like Boeing, Lockheed etc.) to ambitious, nimble and energetic start-ups who skirt or even overstep established rules.These tectonic shifts will affect all of us in terms of safety, national security and privacy. The rallying cry behind the movement could be summed up as: Move over, NASA!Satellite constellations already rule our daily life on Earth right now, for better or worse: From GPS positioning in cars and planes, over emergency calls in remote areas with no conventional cell phone average, to more accurate weather forecasts and troop or refugee movements in or ahead of conflicts across the globe.The documentary's title is therefore very fitting indeed, the skies have become a Wild Wild Space. Sort of a ""land grab in space"" in the 21st century. Space is now open for business, not just for a few billionaires or very powerful nation states.The WWS documentary is eye-opening in this regard, we are only at the very beginning. The private space sector today (2024) is maybe at the development stage of the early Internet/WWW era back in 1994 (if I had to take a guess after spending some time on the subject over the last decade).Rating: 8/10 for ""normal"" viewers. Highly recommended, even for people with no particular or prior interest in the space industry. Even 9/10 for audiences interested in space and rockets.One of my minor gripes: Space has no boundaries. It would have been great if the documentary also featured a few space start-ups from Asia or Europe, the movie feels a bit U. S.-centric (with the exception of Rocket Lab and its CEO, originating from New Zealand).

New Zealander Peter Beck is the hearth, soul and charm of this documentary, his pursuit of space is endearing and he's someone who's company I'd gladly follow in a continuous series as they pursue further milestones.The other company was founded as a result of a meeting between Peter Beck and Chris Kemp. What was meant to be a partnership resulted in Chris Kemp starting his own company. Everything Beck is, Kemp isn't. The wannabe Musk oozes arrogance and illusion of grandeur and his pursuit is governed by one very simple goal... making money. To his credit, he's apparently capable of selling snow to an Eskimo, his only redeeming quality in pursuit of orbit. Everything else is accomplished by people around him.The contrast between the two companies can't be more evident.The best part about this documentary is showing how American politics and bureaucracy managed to cripple progress since the golden age of space exploration. If these small companies can accomplish as much as they did in relatively short period of time, imagine what a massive well funded organization could have accomplished in decades.

1274238,No summary,"I am not a massive Blur fan. I don't own any of their CDs, however as someone who was around in the 90's, like Oasis, Blur were part of everyone in the UK's psyche. It was impossible to not hear their music on Top Of The Pops, radio or even nightclubs and pubs if you were socialising at this time. They were not as popular as the more working class Oasis. However Blur did have their fans, which seemed to be mainly female and/or students. They were hyped as being more cerebral than Oasis. But were mocked by their rivals as playing ""Cockney Chimney Sweep Music"" by one Liam Gallagher.This is an odd documentary as it finds the band prepping for their Wembley gig. While they apparently haven't been in touch, that is almost irrelevant as they are still pretty much well known to the UK press. One for cheese and the others for playing music. However this is more intimate camera work and that is the rub of this doc. Because Blur have almost a bad reputation for not being that pleasant. There have been numerous stories about their behaviour and theres the infamous Naurduar interview. This documentary doesn't exactly negate that image. They come across as a but whiny and irritable, unlikable almost. They don't even seem to like each other. The Wembley gig seems like a cash grab and they are simply enduring each other for the payday. So not a million miles from Oasis. However it is still good to see they are still functioning as a band. And some of the convert footage is good. But the much covered incident of Damon breaking down crying on stage isn't in this doc. An obvious omission. I've no idea whats next for Blur but what I do know is a UK tour wasnt on the cards. Like I said, they weren't as popular as Oasis.",6.0,torrascotia,2024-11-10,1.0,0.0
1274238,No summary,"You'd think there's not too much to write about To The End. It's a documentary about Blur, with Blur. The band, Blur. If you're not a Blur fan, you're probably not watching this. It follows the band recording and releasing their 2023 album The Ballad of Darren, rehearsing and the celebratory gigs that culminate at Wembley. Shot over the course of a year it's intimate and honest. Well paced and in depth, with plenty of time with Damon, Alex, Graham and Dave. Filmed in part in a very big house in the remote coastal countryside, it has a bohemian air. This is latter-day Blur, gone are the young cheeky lads. There's a weight of expectation now. Especially now in that they're leading up to the biggest gigs of their career, all whilst being less active than ever before. As Dave says ""The less we do, the bigger we get"". They are genuinely interesting people to watch. There's a clear bond, but they are all very different and have had different lives outside the band. It's a lot of people sitting around, smoking in scruffy clothes that probably cost a fortune in barn-like rooms which certainly do cost a fortune. ""I live alone in the countryside and this record feels very much like that"" states Damon and Graham echos ""A boulder had fallen out and there's 40 years worth of stuff in this boulder that's been dislodged"". It's raw and emotional, particularly from Damon who's clearly the driving force. He famously doesn't switch off and this does seem to add some friction to the band dynamic. It works though doesn't it, the songs are wonderful. Speaking of wonderful, Graham is wonderfully dour, moaning about the environment of practice spaces and being ""blinded by stupid lights"". Alex is dramatic and Dave, well Dave is the sensible one as ever. He's the one you can understand, relate to. It's oddly shambolic, but there's tons of depth. They're not afraid to show the process and delve into the past. There's no Britpop focus, what's the point that's story has been told. There is plenty of the origin story told around the rehearsals and the warm up gigs. In Colchester we get 'Popscene' and Eastbourne is treated 'Parklife', it effortlessly makes me want to see them live again. This is much more than the music though. Blur are a band that despite their success have always been oddly undersold as genuine artists. This documentary shows them in their best light, warts and all.

1274238,No summary,"I was always more of a ""Blur"" fan than an ""Oasis"" one, but to be honest I'd forgotten completely why they had split up. This fly-on-the-wall documentary tries to fill in some of the gaps as it reunites the four members of the band who are going to record their first new album in decades and do a little mini-tour of some ""intimate"" venues before a couple of gigs in front of eighty-odd thousand people at London's Wembley stadium. The film is centred around Damon Albarn's home in the South West of England and as Graham Coxon (anyone else think he's turning into Dudley Moore?), renowned cheesemaker Alex James and Dave Rowntree turn up it seems that there's a lot of forgiving and forgetting going on. There's a conversational candour from all four about their demise as a band. They couldn't stand the sight of one another - hardly surprising after living in each other's pockets for years, but it's clear that there is still something compelling, addictive even, about their relationships that will either float or sink this ambitions project that is proving nerve-wracking even now, after years of performing. I could have been doing with more of their music, if only to remind me there was more to them than ""Boys and Girls"" and ""Parklife"", and I could have done with less of their political hypocrisy as they live in safe conservative parliamentary seats whilst espousing urbanite socialism - but when it comes down to it, they are just four formerly quite handsome guys (yes, I know that's reductive!) who knew how to put lyrics and music into a format that mischievously and vibrantly entertained on a stage and on a television at a time when music in Britain was undoubtedly suffering from a creative malaise that was crying out for something different, energetic and powerful.

The guys who pull Lenny's legs to their advantage don't add any serious conflict to the movie to create a thrill. When Bewdya was revealed to be Asgar, the don who went undercover, it captured my attention. But his arc was underwhelming as a drunkard gets sober conveniently and becomes an action hero.The characters Thik and Thak initially start as threats to Lenny but turn out to be his allies as the movie progresses, which is not well written. Lenny's wife's true intention is a poor decision as it is the biggest twist in the movie. It is an inappropriate twist to be placed in a movie that deals with multiple plots like a gang war, rivals from Lenny's profession, etc. My initial thought on the private investigator (before he revealed himself) was that he was a rival reporter who envied Lenny's growth. It would have been better if they portrayed him in that way. I was fed up with the climax because it leads to a sequel (which makes me hate this movie even more) and it is conveniently written.The actors did a decent job as they didn't have any scope to express their talent. The casting was good, but Mouni Roy felt unnecessary as her character comes for a wasted twist. She is a gimmick to pull the audience.

Not at all recommended. Worst staff experienced at blackout. They are just perfect to spoil your festive evening well. Thats the reason it was not that full as 4 years back. I was also supprised. You Go out for service and feel however After spending 10 k you are not going to get at blackout. From desk to waiters to bouncers have super attitude that customer is nothing for them. They think if you are going to blackout its customer privilege but they are absolutely wrong as if you cant value customer people like me are not gonna visit.From entrance to order to service it was totally challenging there but main thing for which m giving them 1 star because 2 male bouncers misbehaved with me just I was calling my friends after getting out from washroom as they didn't pick so I was just wanna chk them on deck from outside area of disc. They started behaving rudely after explaining them. And not only 1 2nd came started humra time ho gya yhn jana allowed nh h. When I didn't go to disc when it was open why would I go when it's closed just to watch my friends who were up n I was on down floor they created the whole scene and managers everyone was supporting them. Worst ever experience I had anywhere.I must say if you want your value never ever visit places like this where so rude cheap attitudic staff.Vibrations won't allow you to sit on rooftop.

Seeing vikrant massey in an animated character was not on my cards in big 2024, but he acted really well. That is the good thing about great actors, they can pull off diverse roles. The film gets a boost once sunil grover enters, and good lord he gobbles up with his screen presence. He outshadowed massey in various sequences. The black comedy, dispersed throughout guides the film. The lines given to karan sonawane and saurabh gadge are hilarious. They always come up with some crackers in between conversations. Mouni roy really needs to work on her acting. Ruhani sharma, anant joshi, jisshu sengupta and other fringe characters were decent.The second half literally wanders around to hundred directions. Anything and everything was happening in the second half. Twists after twists were coming but only one or two worked. How will the rest work without some good breathing space between scenes. After a point, the scenes looked reverse engineered. It didn't happen because of logic, but because of convenience. The screenplay, was losing steam because of this and suffers.The background score is great, I would say. The suspense and adrenaline is pumped up by the score. Some old songs are used with some wacky humour. I like that the film knows what it's doing and breaks the clatter sometimes. Because, in some scenes the chaos was overpowering the storytelling. The humour felt off to me in various scenes. The dialogues were not up to the mark. The scenes where massey imagines diamonds and jewels falling from the sky is brilliant.

Not at all typecasting him but he genuinely doesn't have a comical presence. Rest of the cast was average at its best barring Mr Joshi Sengupta who shines in a short cameo & one word to Mr Sunil Grover, how much lower you will stoop down in choosing your roles, we all have witnessed your absolute vulgar & cheap acts on the Netflix Kapil sharma show, you were considered the best part of the show for your portrayal of gutthi, Rinku Devi or Dr Gulati & we were so thrilled at your comeback but what we witnessed was absolute carnage.So not deviating from the topic, here are some honorable mentions if you want to enjoy Bollywood's one night adventure movies -

Crime reporter Lenny D'Souza (Vikrant Massey) finds himself at the center of the chaos after a car accident leads him to a van full of dead men and cash. The ensuing events involve a motley crew of characters, including a hilarious alcoholic (Sunil Grover), dimwitted thieves (Karan Sonaware & Saurabh Ghadge), and a damsel-in-distress (Mouni Roy).Vikrant Massey shines as the harried Lenny, perfectly capturing his desperation and growing paranoia. Sunil Grover steals the show with his delightfully unhinged portrayal of Bewdya, offering genuine laugh-out-loud moments. The blackout creates a tense atmosphere, and the initial car crash sparks curiosity about the hidden secrets within the van.The film tries to juggle too many characters and subplots, leading to a messy narrative that loses focus. The introduction of new characters in the second half feels forced, and some plot twists are predictable. Blackout attempts to be a dark comedy, but the humor lands inconsistently. The attempts at emotional drama also feel out of place. The camerawork and editing are serviceable but don't particularly stand out.Blackout has its moments, thanks to the strong performances of Massey and Grover. However, the uneven screenplay and tonal inconsistencies prevent it from reaching its full potential. If you're looking for a fast-paced, light-hearted comedy, this might not be the best choice.

The performances and jokes only make the adventure more enjoyable. Vikrant Massey's movie ends on a cliffhanger, so let's hope there's more to this frenzy. Blackout does push the limits in how shamelessly foolish it strives to be. That's seldom enough, though, at a time where screwball comedies count on the viewer's perception of reality.

1208013,No summary,"Most of us have no doubt heard the old saying (adapted from the famous poem by Robert Burns), ""The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry."" And, in the case of a pair of hopelessly lost Gen Z misfits (Jacon Roberts, David Treviño), truer words couldn't have been spoken. The two longtime friends from Austin, TX attempt to relocate to New York, but, when their plans fall through, they return home to regroup and figure out a way to get back to the Big Apple. They ""decide"" to land good-paying jobs (without any realistic prospects) from which they can diligently (or so they believe) stash away bundles of cash for a year and, simultaneously, multiply their savings by finding ways to live rent free with (i.e., shamelessly sponge off of) friends, family and even strangers, a plan they're thoroughly convinced will work. However, the reality turns out to be far different from their hopelessly misguided wishful thinking, straining their friendships with others and themselves. Their wickedly funny story (with a few touching moments) turns out to be a damning exploration of improbable, unworkable thinking, unbridled irresponsibility, inflated entitlement and generally bad form between themselves and with those who offer to help them out (but who subsequently prove to have agendas of their own as well). One would like to hope that this experience will work out (or at least provide them with a much-needed wake-up call), but will it? In that sense, ""Rent Free"" is a brutally telling story about a generation that not only hasn't come of age, but that is in serious need of growing up. Writer-director Fernando Andrés' second feature offering delivers a bitingly blistering modern day road trip/buddy movie of sorts about two lost souls seeking to find themselves but who perpetually get in their own way. It's particularly noteworthy for the fact that this is a film involving individuals who are part of the LGBTQ+ community but whose sexuality is more ancillary than integral to the narrative, allowing their other personal attributes and actions to carry the picture and not relying exclusively on scenarios related to their gay and bisexual orientation to define them or the nature of the story. Some viewers (particularly younger ones) may be insulted or offended by some of the content here, but perhaps that's because the filmmaker holds up a highly polished, undeniably scrutinous mirror to them and their lifestyles, providing a profoundly revelatory look at why their lives don't live up to their assumed expectations. Indeed, there is no such thing as a free lunch, and this inspired, razor-sharp offering proves that - whether viewers want to see that or not.",8.0,brentsbulletinboard,2024-09-22,0.0,0.0

1066383,No summary,"Despite a visually tiring start, the movie gets interesting from this point on. The only entertainment for the social media phenomenon characters is drinking, sexuality, meaningless gestures and conversations. It doesn't start in a violent way, but it makes you wonder what will happen in the following minutes. The depressive Amanda character and her grandmother's behavior add humor to the film. The other phenomena seem very selfish, self-absorbed. It's ridiculous that they just sit and stare while their friends are drowning. I liked the atmosphere where they are trapped in the house and it suddenly becomes tense. The production speeds up and slows down but the pace is good. The deaths are not very effective, so they could have been a bit more disturbing. The act are in tune with each other and make an effort to be believable. Cassandra Scerbo suits this kind of production and I find her successful. There could have been a different ending. An enjoyable slasher.",5.0,nature_whisper,2024-08-15,3.0,1.0

But the story about how they catch a gang of criminals is well told, the action is spectacular. It's anice mix of action and humout although the humour sometimes is a bit over the top.

There is a great chase scene reminicicent of Peur sur la Ville and many characters actually have names from Belmondo films.

1298819,No summary,"The title itself demonstrated a complete misunderstanding of social media influencers. The movie while it has a few good gags and laughs. Just enough to keep you watching hoping it will overcome that awekward teenage stage and develop into a grown movie, it never does. This movie could best be described as video acne. Somebody put money into this effort as the video work, audio work, and other elements were quite well done. If you muted the dialog you could believe you were watching a Hollywood movie. As lame as Hollywood's dialog gets nowadays, this movie manages to make modern Hollywood dialog seem sophisticated. Even National Lampoon seems mature compared to this movie which actually seems aimed at kids under 10 but has some very adult elements too it.First you start off hating every character in the movie almost instantly. Starting with the Munchausen mama, the gay gay not sure what he does besides be gay dudette, the feminine ideal of a toxic male, the fake guru, and finally the skinny muscle dude who comes the closest to being likable. I'm forgetting one very forgettable character in this forgettable movie. You get the idea, however. Whoever wrote this hates everyone and isn't afraid to stereotype to the point of actually turning cardboard characters into the kind of thing you see a 3rd grade playwright create.The mystery doesn't last long at all, and when revealed makes fairly little sense. The attack on social media is so stereotyped that it is neither social commentary nor social comedy. The horror aspect is so goofy that it isn't going to scare anybody over 7 years old, but this is a movie kids under 15 should not be watching. It's not even comedic horror. It's just a distraction in an already weak effort.

1298819,No summary,"*** PREFACE: I may be the wrong audience to be leaving an opinion here, compared to the other first-time reviewers only gushing over it, but I wanted to touch on some thoughts about the actual story... ***-- PSYCHOSoShal:So right off the bat, I'm sorry, but the title is pretty meh. I don't even know how ""Clickbait"" has anything to do with the movie. You girls already had this perfect word you came up with that easily lent itself to any number of clever play-on-words titles sitting right in front of you with ""SoShal"". You could have gone with almost anything related to ""Social _______"" (The SoShal Experiment? SoShal Media Challenge?), the possibilities write themselves.-- SoShal STANDING:It was unconventional to say the least. Deftly produced as everything looked and sounded great and professionally put together, the lighting, the shot compositions, they all worked well... The dialogue however got a bit heavy with slogans, quotes, and influencer advice (which may have been apropos) but it all began to sound like fortune cookies to me.Overall it reminds me of similar movies OCTOGAMES (2022) and FUNHOUSE (2019) which had similar plots, budgets, and a similar presentation of the ""contest"" with the use of a virtual host. Even the NPC SoShal workers felt indicative of SQUID GAMES, except because they came in different heights and wore their pants up high they reminded of those ""Shy Guys"" from Super Mario Bros., but with fencer masks.And speaking of costuming, why did y'all have homegirl dressed up like one of those fortune teller machines (like from the movie BIG) the whole movie?-- SoShal MEDIA INFLUENCE:There is a lot about social media influencer culture that I'm just not familiar with, so I think movies like these would really benefit from having a proxy character for the audience to be introduced to things and how things work. A character who is discovering so the audience can discover (as commonly done in fantasy movies, card poker movies, science movies, stock trading movies) our own Neo in the Matrix.Because as it stands I didn't quite get that these caricatures were indicative of what's popular on Youtube (LookLoop). Or why these characters were who best represented it.I would've imagined in a story like this (and given what the villains were aiming to accomplish) it would've also included like an InstaModel, a self-important outrage media critic, a watch me eat stuff guy, a sexy try-on haul girl, and a conspiracy theorist as well. A whole gamut of ""look at me"" personalities.-- SoShal ISSUES:1. I didn't get how they all mostly knew of each other if they only had followings of 250K. Coincidence or convenience, but there are YouTubers with millions of followers that I either never heard of, or watch, or discovered years after everyone else did (and I loathe the day I learned what a Pewtipie was) so I can't imagine like Ron Tron, Lele Pons, Legal Eagle, the Corridor Crew, and Ryan George all just happening to be fans of one another (much less with smaller channels at just 250K subs).2. I also didn't get what made the kid unboxing things channel be so believably popular. He seemed to be so disinterested in being in anything (including the movie itself) and had to have his mom feeding him lines to parrot the entire time like it's all still new to him. How would his fanbase not be put off by her disembodied voice constantly yakking off-camera like he's a ventriloquist dummy? How is that entertainment?3. Also were all of their fanbases just sitting around online in empty virtual rooms waiting for them to randomly pop in to livestream record their 1-minute hostage videos? And with them filming these things side-by-side within earshot of each other, that is exactly what these videos would look like to any longtime fans of theirs.4. Where would all of those new followers even come from and so suddenly if their uploads were being posted to each of their own hacked channels for their already existing audience? There was nothing mentioned about drawing in outside interest nor a hashtag from the start to encourage any crossover pollination from amongst each other's followings.Actually that would've made more sense to have their live feeds simulcast across each others channels thus pooling all 6 of their 250K following into a potential 1.5 million net total.-- LAST SoShal POINTS:WTF was on that eyeball? -LOL! The gun poking in/out of the cubby. -HUH? What happened to the rest of the Shy Guys? -HEY, the poster looks like the Looney Tunes ""That's all folks!"" background. -AND So what if some hacker deletes your faux-youtube account, it's 2024 and these are supposed to be successful influencers, wouldn't they have other social media accounts to fall back on if they had to restart their ""YouTube"" channel?Well that's it for my 4 and a half cents and some change.",4.0,talentest,2024-07-01,6.0,4.0

Movie Review: A Disappointing ExperienceThis film stands out as one of the worst I've ever seen. From the very beginning, it was clear that this movie was going to be a struggle to get through. The plot was nonsensical, the dialogue was cringeworthy, and the performances left much to be desired.I found myself questioning why these talented actors would choose to participate in such a poorly crafted film. It's baffling that they would associate themselves with a project that offers so little in terms of quality or substance. The characters felt one-dimensional, and there was no real emotional connection to any of them.The pacing was excruciatingly slow, and I kept checking the time, wondering how much longer I had to endure. The attempts at humor fell flat, the action sequences were dull, and any attempt at drama felt forced and unconvincing.It's frustrating to think about the time wasted watching this movieYou said:

Movie Review: A Disappointing ExperienceThere are bad movies, and then there are movies that make you regret the very decision to sit down and watch them. Unfortunately, this film falls into the latter category. It's not just that it was poorly executed, or that the story made little sense-this movie was an outright disaster from start to finish. To put it bluntly, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen.Let's start with the plot, or rather, the lack of one. The movie begins with a confusing setup that never really leads anywhere. It seems as though the writers were trying to be clever by throwing in twists and turns, but instead, they only succeeded in creating a mess. The storyline is incoherent, jumping from one scene to the next without any real direction. By the halfway point, I had completely lost interest in trying to follow what was happening.The dialogue, too, was a major issue. It's almost as if the script was written by someone who has never heard a real conversation in their life. The characters spoke in clichés and delivered lines that made me cringe. I couldn't help but feel embarrassed for the actors who had to say such things on screen. It was as if the writers were trying too hard to be clever or funny, but in the end, it just came off as awkward and unnatural.Speaking of the actors, I can't help but wonder why they chose to be a part of this film in the first place. Many of them are quite talented, and I've seen them deliver great performances in other projects. However, in this movie, it felt like they were simply going through the motions, as if they knew they were stuck in a sinking ship but had no choice but to see it through to the end. The characters they played were one-dimensional and lacked any real depth or development. I couldn't connect with any of them, and by the end of the film, I didn't care what happened to them.It's truly a shame to see such talent wasted on a project like this. I found myself constantly questioning why these actors would agree to participate in a movie that was so clearly destined to fail. Was it a contractual obligation? A favor to a friend? Whatever the reason, it's clear that this film did nothing to showcase their abilities.Another major issue with the film was the pacing. At nearly two hours long, the movie felt like it dragged on for an eternity. The slow pacing only made the already weak plot feel even more drawn out. I kept checking the time, wondering when it would finally be over. It's one thing for a movie to be slow-paced if it's building toward something meaningful, but that was not the case here. Instead, it felt like the filmmakers were simply filling time with pointless scenes that did nothing to advance the story.The attempts at humor were another low point. The jokes were flat and felt forced, and I don't recall laughing even once throughout the entire movie. The comedic timing was off, and the humor often felt out of place within the context of the story. It's as if the filmmakers were trying to lighten the mood, but instead, they only succeeded in making the movie even more awkward and uncomfortable to watch.The action sequences, if you can even call them that, were dull and uninspired. There was no real excitement or tension, and the choreography was sloppy. It felt like the filmmakers were just going through the motions, throwing in a few action scenes for the sake of it, without any real thought or effort behind them.By the time the credits finally rolled, I was left feeling a mixture of frustration and relief-frustration at the time I had wasted on such a terrible film, and relief that it was finally over. It's rare that I feel this strongly negative about a movie, but this one truly earned it. If you're considering watching this film, I strongly advise against it. Save yourself the time and energy, and choose something else to watch. Trust me, you'll be glad you did.You said:

Movie Review: A Disappointing ExperienceSome movies leave you entertained, some make you think, and others, like this one, make you question why you even bothered watching it in the first place. Unfortunately, this film falls squarely into the category of regrettable viewing experiences. From its incoherent plot to its cringeworthy dialogue, this is one of the worst films I've ever seen.To start with, the plot-or what little there was of it-was a complete mess. The movie begins with a confusing setup that tries to be clever but ends up being a jumbled collection of scenes that don't connect in any meaningful way. The story attempts to include twists and turns, but they only add to the confusion, leaving the viewer frustrated and disengaged. By the time the film reached its midpoint, I had given up on trying to follow the narrative, and frankly, I didn't care where it was going.The dialogue was another glaring issue. It felt like the script was written by someone who had never heard a natural conversation before. The characters spoke in forced clichés and unnatural lines that made me cringe more than once. Rather than sounding witty or insightful, the dialogue came across as awkward and out of place, making it difficult to take the characters seriously.This brings me to the performances, which were, sadly, just as disappointing as the script they were given to work with. Many of the actors in this film are talented, but you wouldn't know it from watching this movie. It seemed like they were merely going through the motions, perhaps aware that the film was a lost cause but unable to do anything about it. Their characters were one-dimensional, lacking any real depth or development. I found myself completely disconnected from them, and by the end of the movie, I didn't care what happened to any of them.It's a real shame to see such potential wasted. I kept asking myself why these actors chose to be a part of this project. Was it a contract obligation, or perhaps a misguided favor? Whatever the reason, it's clear that this film did nothing to showcase their talents and may have even done them a disservice by association.Another significant problem with the film was its pacing. At nearly two hours, the movie felt like it was dragging on forever. The slow pace only amplified the film's other flaws, making the weak plot feel even more tedious. I found myself checking the time repeatedly, hoping it would be over soon. There's nothing wrong with a slow-paced film if it's building toward something meaningful, but that wasn't the case here. Instead, it felt like the filmmakers were simply filling time with unnecessary scenes that did nothing to advance the story or develop the characters.The attempts at humor were equally ineffective. The jokes fell flat, and I don't recall laughing even once throughout the entire film. The comedic timing was off, and the humor often felt out of place within the context of the story. Rather than adding levity, the humor only made the movie feel more awkward and disjointed.The action sequences were another low point. They were dull and uninspired, lacking any real excitement or tension. The choreography was sloppy, and the scenes felt like they were included as an afterthought rather than as a key part of the story.By the time the credits rolled, I was left feeling a mix of frustration and relief-frustration at the time I had wasted on such a terrible film, and relief that it was finally over. It's rare that I feel this strongly negative about a movie, but this one truly deserves it. If you're considering watching this film, do yourself a favor and skip it.

1090566,No summary,"With such a solid cast and crew, it isn't wrong to expect some quality writing, production design, and performances here. The film's key selling point (two people getting stuck in a zoo enclosure with a lion) merely comes across as an unnecessary plot diversion, which neither resolves any core character conflicts nor explains the poorly scripted (and crafted) tail-end. This is not even close to the vintage Suraj Venjaramood you'd love to see in a premise like this. There are a couple of oddly fun one-liners, but 99.8% of attempts at humor fail to evoke even a chuckle. VFX, animatronics, and even capturing a real lion's antics on camera couldn't make the entire ""dealing with a lion & a drunkard"" scenes any better-those are just difficult to sit through.I remember laughing more for an atrocious film like Crocodile Love Story than this one - at least, it had fun interventions from Kalabhavan Mani, Prem Kumar, and company. Here, despite the presence of performers like Manju Pillai, Rajesh Madhavan, Ramesh Pisharody, Alancier Ley Lopez, and Malayalam cinema's new-gen master of satire Ratheesh Balakrishnan Poduval, it simply feels like a potpourri of characters. This also contributes to diluting the stakes of the central plot, which lacks any sort of emotional hook.

Camera, actor performance, set design, sound - all top notch. But that's where it ends - effective set pieces fall apart, themes get muddled, time drags on for no reason.

1144965,No summary,"Last week, I had the privilege of attending the premiere of ""Paper Flowers"" at the iconic Chinese Theater in Hollywood. This heartwarming film, produced by Asit Vyas and directed by Mahesh Pailoor, is based on the real-life story of Shalin Shah, a US-born son of immigrant Indian parents. The film beautifully explores Shalin's journey and his relationship with his high school sweetheart, Fiona Chang, the daughter of a Taiwanese immigrant single father.The story follows Shalin, a vibrant USC graduate with an unorthodox approach to life, who joins the US Peace Corps in Peru only to be diagnosed with cancer shortly after. The film delves deeply into the emotional turmoil faced by Shalin's parents and provides a poignant look at the inner struggles of families dealing with a young cancer patient. Equally moving is Fiona's unwavering commitment to Shalin, knowing their time together may be short.Shalin's determination to live life to the fullest and spread joy, despite his diagnosis, is inspiring. The use of artistic metaphors, such as paper flowers and sunsets, adds a unique and admirable touch to the film. The screenplay, meticulously crafted by Mari Krell-Oishi with contributions from Asit Vyas and Mahesh Pailoor, captures these themes beautifully.The performances in ""Paper Flowers"" are exceptional. Olivia Liang, as Fiona, showcases her maturity and skill, perfectly complementing Kapil Talvalkar's portrayal of Shalin. Faran Thair and Meera Simhan deliver powerful performances as Shalin's parents, adding depth to the narrative.What sets ""Paper Flowers"" apart is its delicate handling of the subject matter. The director ensures that the film does not become overly sentimental but instead conveys a profound message about life's purpose and making the most of it. The ""Iceberg Theory"" is skillfully applied, with the script and direction subtly conveying more than what is explicitly shown.The film's score, cinematography, and overall production quality are excellent, enhancing the storytelling experience. While ""Paper Flowers"" offers moments of deep emotion, it remains a testament to Shalin's positive outlook on life, avoiding melodrama.The title itself, ""Paper Flowers,"" serves as a powerful metaphor for resilience and beauty in the face of adversity. Kudos to the producer for their courage, creativity, and ingenuity in bringing such a beautiful film to life.I highly recommend ""Paper Flowers"" to anyone contemplating life's purpose. This real-life story is a must-watch, offering a moving and inspiring experience.Review by Vijay Bhatt - June 25, 2024.",10.0,asitpvyas,2024-06-28,1.0,0.0

Isn't this what film should be in our time?Over the decades and with different styles and treatments, filmmakers have risen above mere entertainment to bring a message in the context of popular art. It's almost a genre, but let's not go there. Let's simply take the film on its own merit.Although the social issues addressed here, the disproportionate incarceration rates of people of color, the legality of harmless recreational drugs, and the roiling of family structures under the oppression of a dysfunctional society, will hopefully be transcended in a brighter future world, the ambiguous interplay of right and wrong, legally and morally, will never go out of style as the foundation of art.Grassland checks all the boxes of storyline validity, visual attractiveness, and, especially, dramatic performance by a skilled ensemble.

It is a crossover not a grand final episode, and for a cross over I think its 8 outta 10, the chemistry and mixing of the 2 anime was top notch, felt so natural. The first 2 fights were top notch, I was surprised they were able to show such good content, 3 fights and some fun bits in such a short time. People have so much expectation these days. Its a special crossover between what I think the 2 Best Fighting Anime out dere, and for that it was very well made, I would be jumping with excitement if they make the whole season out of it, you all with low scores, need to have patience, its just a small part of the big things yet to come my friends.",9.0,hostreachable,2024-06-12,0.0,1.0

Neither Baki nor Oma win this one, cringe wins the tournament hands down.In their attempt not to anger fans of either show they made a stupid fan service cringefest of fighters complementing one another and no serious upsets or major characters taking a loss or beating, everything was designed for the sacrificial lambs C-level characters to lose to their A or B level counterparts from the other show. Predictable, boring, pointless and CRINGE!Oh, yeah, the animation style sucked too.

However, the more I thought about it the more I got nervous because the two shows have very different animation, Kengan is very in your face and much more graphic. They are both super entertaining however the expectation is set higher when it comes to kengan animation. Baki relies heavily on light shows to dramatize the fights whereas Kengan is more ""realistic"". Overall I'm disappointed in how rushed the whole thing was as far as going for a movie rather than a season and obviously because I feel the animation was definitely not up to par.

I mean, who was responsible for the decision, like ""Ok, that's something worth to watch, we can release it"", having in mind how were made the previous productions?Maybe it was just for money, but even though it wasn't worth it I believe.I enjoyed watching both series, even though I'm more towards Kengan Ashura, but both of them kept you in a entertaining, interesting and funny way that you could feel they are solid, well made quality productions; some moments were brilliant and figthing scenes were something to looking forward to every time, in every episode. To me Kengan Ashura was a little more mature in its style, very raw and animations were decent. Baki is more narrative, but both of them got an interesting script for fights and characters to the point that you could feel the tension. We haven't received any of these in this production. It was more like a long trailer, and a bad one. Very bland and predictable. It's sad since obviously you deserve the same quality at least, but for some reasons they totally screwed it up.And if it's crossover then maybe we should see some new animation style instead of Baki's style to be fair?Anyway, it's a very boring production, and it seems they were just lazy enough to make it as it is. That's why only 1/10.I can assume that it could have been way better with only one main fight, one decent fight per movie (if there wanted to make more), and maybe the second on a side, out of the stage, like we got previously in the series (that were also well made) with good storyline.",1.0,CG_MON,2024-06-10,1.0,1.0

I don't know why there are so many people complaining on the internet, this is purely fan service and it's great, the animation on average is better than an animated series, the characters are very charismatic in 2D, the characters have obtained techniques that they haven't used in a long time, for example Baki used moves that he didn't even use in the fight against his father, and then he used Katsumi's supersonic punch, I just think that Yujiro should fight in the future with the Connector and not with the gensai who are nowhere near his strength.People saying Baki was weakened, but what did they expect when this movie was announced? Did you already know this and don't want to admit it, did you want Ohma to be defeated in one fell swoop?

It felt as if they watched a bit of Baki and Kengan, decided to have them fight like battle bots, and then add a hint of dramatic filler amongst the non-combatant fighters. The consequences of each match felt unnatural and this movie felt contrived.What's worse is that, regardless of Netflix's disposable cash, they advertised the bejeezus out of this simply for fan service and not for returning customers (viewers in this case.) I've been pretty upset at good franchises being squandered, (look up: The Last Airbender, Solo: A Star Wars Story, et al.) but this ranks ridiculously high on the chart.I can say with no doubt that a direct sequel to this fanfare flick is already not worth my time.

Between this and Garouden: The Way of the Lone Wolf that Netflix has recently released, it's really disappointing the state of martial arts anime that feel empty,devoid, and lack any substance with their stories or with the martial arts techniques, to them a martial arts anime is just punching with occasionally a kick without superpowers.

The screen paly wasn't that great and the way he showed the film in second half felt disconnected .There was no effort put by the team in last part of the film especially before the final fight and during the fight .It looked like that they where in a hurry to finish the making of the film as fast as possible .it's a big no to the director ,there were a few inspirations while filming also there are few copies as well.Ex-The scene before credits which was brutally copied from the film ""Leo"".In conclusion the director wanted to cook something up it come out to a bit ""unrefined""3.)Actors: The lead actor Sudheer babu has done a pretty good job , he carried the movie for some extent but other supporting roles weren't up to the mark, especially sunil.The father character could've done better ,but he has definitely has done a better job than sunil but it wouldn't have mattered much if the story and direction where upto the mark.4.)production: The production team has done a great job with a budget of 12 crores there went nothing wrong here but could have done some better marketing of the film but still it would've not bought a huge difference since the story and the film itself wasn't that great.Conclusion: This film's base (story and direction feels unprocessed). It looks like they made this film forcefully , I personally wouldn't recommend this film but if u got time to waste u can watch this film once because u would not like to see It again. Sudheer babu is a good actor but has to choose good script.",2.0,vaivaswatharishi,2024-07-17,7.0,4.0
1040718,No summary,"Except for the first 30 minutes, which can get confusing & slowly become boring, everything is good. The movie picks up & gets you engaged when it gets to the main story. And not to mention, the theme song is so epic & it gives a great high when its played in certain moments & the action scenes. They should've used it for more scenes but is still okay in the end.Sudheer Babu portrays a hero that plans his own mission, goes through a lot of emotions & becomes the man of the people.Dont listen to the other reviews saying ""its a time waste movie"" or ""Outdated stuff"". Theres some people that really dont like movies when they're less than perfect. They get overtly upset at bad color grading or the hero's overuse of guns (which is the theme of the movie to begin with! Lol). Very stupid people. If a movie is not perfect, then its a ""bad film"" or ""its time wasting"". Smh.Yes in some scenes, the movie doesnt do well in the writing department. It doesnt make it clear what it wants to do especially in the beginning. It sets up some characters but lacks in depth of that set up because it looks like a very typical massy action film in the beginning. And it also loses focus & drags a little bit in the second half of the film. The color grading works good in some scenes & doesnt work in other scenes. But in the end, the action is there, the emotions are there, the theme song is there, the story telling is decent, the music & soundtrack in different moments & scenes carry the film on its shoulders, which is very nice to see & it keeps you engaged throughout.Overall. Its a very well done action movie. Yes theres some problems here & there. But in the end, you'll enjoy it & you'll have fun watching it from beginning to end & you'll like it.

1305575,No summary,"Love Li is a Kannada movie that tries to ride the wave of romantic dramas but ends up sinking under the weight of its cliches, lackluster performances, and uninspired direction. With an unoriginal plot and forgettable characters, this film is a prime example of what happens when filmmakers rely too heavily on formulas and forget to inject creativity and authenticity.The story follows the typical trope of a love triangle, featuring an indecisive protagonist who is torn between his first love and a new, more assertive romantic interest. From the outset, Love Li fails to offer anything fresh or compelling. The plot meanders through predictable twists and turns, never surprising the audience or offering deeper insight into the characters' motivations. The narrative feels stretched thin, making the film's runtime a test of patience.One of the few aspects where Love Li could have excelled is its soundtrack, given that music often plays a crucial role in Kannada romantic dramas. However, even here, the film falls short. The songs are forgettable and do little to enhance the narrative or evoke any emotion. The background score is overbearing at times, attempting to compensate for the lack of emotional depth but only managing to highlight the film's shortcomings.It's a film best left unwatched unless you're in the mood for a lesson in what not to do in filmmaking.",1.0,rdavidsonstr,2024-08-31,2.0,2.0

Now, archaeologists are poised on the brink of proving that these stories and the historical figures they portray are very real indeed.Careful archaeology and science are at the fore in MYSTERIES OF THE TERRA COTTA WARRIORS, yet the documentary never gets too far into the scientific weeds and remains accessible to all. Dramatic reenactments of the past add interest without getting overly speculative and losing their educational value.With excellent organization and pacing, the filmmakers have brought a bit of the history of what may be the world's oldest known civilization to life.

1255028,No summary,"Alright, being the first commenter without any archeological knowledge besides the odd documentaries I watched through the years, my opinion is rooted in ignorance yet awe for the people who attempted and are still working on this gargantuan project to search for the facts behind this massive find. It started out with archeologists unearthing the first find which they show as a clay face poking through the soil. I was hooked. The commencing footage gave me goose bumps. I was in my 20s when this site was discovered and of course I was amazed to see those individual restored soldiers standing in rows. Totally forgot about it until this documentary with life action appeared here at Netflix. With all the low quality productions emerging lately on Netflix this is standing out. I'm thrilled to learn about a part of Chinese history from over 2000 years ago. The conspiracies and brutalities used in politics to annihilate your opponents used in other civilizations were also applied here therefore it's not an easy watch. The discovery of yet many other tombs and the methods to determine whose they were kept me glued to the screen.

1298821,No summary,"This movie is camp at its finest. It is such a purely fun experience with twists at every turn, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. And for the budget that it likely had, the filmmakers did an excellent job.Some people hold all movies to the same high standards, but you really need to put films into perspective. Tubi Originals are usually made for under $1m, with most of them closer to $500k. The trivia section says this film was shot in 14 days, which leads me to believe it was closer to a $500k budget. That is an enormously tight schedule and budget. You can't compare it to films with multi-million dollar budgets that got months to shoot.Of course there will be imperfect elements when shooting on that kind of budget and timeframe, but they clearly ran with their limitations and made the best product that they could. You can't criticize a film like this for those things. Really, it's big budget films that we should be more critical of -- When you have all the money and resources in the world, your film should be flawless, but many aren't. On micro budget films it should be a given that there will be some flaws, and that's okay.This film did an excellent job at creating a fun and dynamic atmosphere, and capitalized well on its budget and limitations.

1298821,No summary,"One of those disposable teen murder dramas making heavy use of flashbacks and time juxaposition to enrich a story which would otherwise appear lightweight. The producers might argue they are breaking new ground, but in fact this sort of arc has been beaten to death in recent streaming series (CRUEL SUMMER, for eg.) The one thing these sorts of stories do offer is a chance for individual actors to shine, and jump-start their careers. WHIM has two standouts -- Annalisa Cochrane as the pending murder victim vamps it to the hilt, continuing a cinematic tradition that goes back to Tuesday Weld in the 1960s. But, for casting directors of the future, Ashlei Sharpe Chestnut is the one to watch. Here she continues to take secondary roles and make them pop (like in PICARD). By the halfway point of the film, it becomes clear to the viewer that she is the ""glue"" that still holds your attention. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

1276013,No summary,"I always find it amazing when a movie comes along that's effectively able to warm and break one's heart at the same time, but that's precisely the feat accomplished by writer-director David Fritz Fortune's impressive debut feature. This simple but powerful, moving tale tells the touching story of a recently widowed single father (William Catlett) who goes to tremendous lengths to take his Down Syndrome-affected son (Jeremiah Alexander Daniels) to his first baseball game in hopes that it will help cheer him up in the wake of the untimely death of his mother (Brandee Evans). Beautifully filmed in black and white, the picture follows the adventures and misadventures of a devoted Atlanta father doing everything he can to care for his special needs child while simultaneously attempting to bring a little joy into his life, all the while dealing with his own grief at the loss of the wife he truly adored. In doing so, the filmmaker serves up a thoroughly engaging story about love and the challenges to maintain it under trying circumstances such as these, a film filled with laughs, tears, setbacks and milestone victories. There's nothing especially fancy about this offering, but its sustained, earnest authenticity is palpable and enveloping without ever becoming manipulative, melodramatic or schmaltzy. It's no exaggeration to say that it earns whatever feelings it evokes among viewers, an accomplishment magnificently achieved through cinematic devices as basic as powerful facial expressions, the undeniable warmth and chemistry between father and son, and gorgeous, unpretentious imagery. Admittedly, this release feels a little stretched out in the final act, almost as if the filmmaker wasn't quite sure how to wrap things up. But, that minor shortcoming aside, it's easy to see how ""Color Book"" captured the Chicago International Film Festival Audience Favorite Award for US Features - it's truly that good. This festival release may be a little difficult to find at the moment, but it deserves a general release, showing us what's possible where there's love - and plenty of it - the kind of story that we could all stand to see more of these days.",9.0,brentsbulletinboard,2024-11-20,0.0,0.0

1183111,No summary,"This film is yet another example of a collection of 'different stories of life' packed into one movie. It follows the multi-narrative format that brings together characters from diverse backgrounds, each with their unique challenges and experiences, giving viewers glimpses into multiple facets of life. While I find the film entertaining, those who have seen the classic movie Jologs-a pioneer of this format-might feel it doesn't quite reach the same level. Jologs set a high bar for this kind of storytelling, combining humor, drama, and a sense of relatability that defined a generation.I appreciate the filmmakers' efforts to create a fresh take and establish its own identity, but there are moments that feel overly familiar. Even the music score, particularly the use of 'Fruitcake,' seems to echo the soundtrack choices in Jologs, especially with similarities to the song 'Next in Line,' which was featured in Jologs. While these familiar elements can be nostalgic, they also risk making the film feel derivative rather than innovative.Despite these criticisms, I still consider the film to be above average. It's a bold attempt at something different, especially in an era where unique storytelling formats are rare. The film takes risks that many others don't, even if it doesn't fully succeed in all aspects.The storyline itself is somewhat chaotic, with a structure that could use refinement. Certain plotlines feel underdeveloped, and the film's flow can feel disjointed at times. However, the characters bring warmth to the screen, and most of them are genuinely likable, which keeps the audience engaged. Some characters, like Ospret, stand out with distinct personalities and memorable arcs, while others fade into the background, coming across as either forgettable or mediocre.In the end, it's still an enjoyable movie. It has its flaws, but its heart and ambition shine through, making it a good watch for anyone looking for a mix of humor, drama, and a snapshot of everyday life.",6.0,ar_jake0316,2024-11-11,0.0,0.0

The perspective of the miners is powerfully told, bringing to life the feelings of the miners and their communities, and the divisions between Nottinghamshire and other mining areas. The footage and eye witness accounts of the events at Orgreave tell a powerful story of politicized policing. What is skimmed over is that this strike was called without a ballot. Its aim was paralyze the electricity supply and steel industries, and inflict damage on a democratically elected government with no thought to the impact on other vulnerable citizens through power cuts etc. We needed to hear from the other side of the dispute. Also useful would have been some portrayal of the damage the trade union movement in general was inflicting on the prosperity of the country through the 70's and early 80's.

Great use of stock footage, but if you're educated on events, you'll see how much was omitted, some of the scenes were truly staggering, violence of the highest order, perhaps they wanted to make this suitable for all?It focuses, perhaps quite rightly on the miners, and its affect on them and their families, it just lacks a bit of content on the political side of things, what was going on behind the scenes.I don't want to get too political, but I'd say the way they depicted both Thatcher and Scargill was interesting to say the least.There was one particularly fascinating piece of info given, the chap that talked about 21 houses on his street, and all 21 houses being supported by people working in the mines.Anyone that doesn't know these events should definitely check if out, it's a turbulent, but very interesting piece of history.8/10.",8.0,Sleepin_Dragon,2024-09-18,15.0,1.0

There is moving testimony by strikers. However the interviews with cops and scabs also help show how the miners were broken.But the real problem is that the film depicts the strike's defeat as simply being because of the violent defeat of the miners at Orgreave. While important, the real reason for the loss was the failure of the wider union movement to deliver significant and sustained solidarity strike action. The video of the lorries leaving Orgreave with coke for the steel plants should have explained that the drivers' unions failed to call them out.I was also disappointed that there wasn't more about how the wider working class sustained the communities through solidarity and donations. These workers' didn't get strike pay.So while the film is inspiring, emotional and will make you hate Thatcher even more, it doesn't get to the heart of how and why the TUC, the Labour Party and the union bureaucrats let the miners down.

1293768,No summary,"I was pleased but surprised to find this unheralded documentary showing at my local Vue multiplex and attended a screening that attracted one other viewer. There have been several recent, quite unsympathetic docs on the strike so I was curious as to how this one would treat it.The perspective is from miners themselves rather than from their former leaders or from commentators, apart from one BBC reporters at the time and a former policeman. That helps ground it into a working-class context, but I was less happy to be denied the necessary political context: where was the Labour party in this? It does mention the TUC's total lack of support but strangely portrays Scargill as no more than a rabble-rouser, out of his depth and outmanoeuvred by canny Conservative operators like Thatcher.The coverage of the Orgreave battle between miners in a field near the coking plant and many thousands of uniformed police doesn't reveal anything new. The lack of serious injuries makes it appear more like a slightly riotous festival, certainly compared to the Marikana massacre in South Africa in 2012 in which 34 miners were murdered by the police.In general, the film lacked a serious political analysis. But its presentation of the deep solidarity in mining communities, and how that was purposely destroyed by the Conservative government with the connivance of a right-wing Labour 'opposition', showed how much we have lost.",7.0,rebeccat-37865,2024-06-23,15.0,1.0

Through repeated references to the opera Rigoletto, the film hints that Miriam's father may have been over-protective of his daughter, even as strange and somewhat sinister notes left in the library suggest Miriam may have a stalker.The narrative builds slowly, showing the library's quirky daily routines which contrast neatly with strong but nuanced emotions running under the surface. Miriam takes steps to broaden her experience of life when she starts conversing with Janko, a Slovenian who drives a taxi to subsidize his artistic aspirations. Britt Lower and Tom Mercier do nice work in the lead roles, endowing Miriam and Janko with humanity and making their relationship credible.

1255065,No summary,"Crisis Negotiators is a serviceable formulaic action thriller that's elevated by Sean Lau Ching Wan and Francis Ng's lead performances and supporting cast. The film's biggest hamper is its paint-by-numbers unambitious approach to its material.A remake of 1998's The Negotiator starring Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey, the story follows senior negotiator Cheuk Man Wai who has been framed for murder and holds a police station hostage to clear his name, with the help of a former negotiator- turned-social worker Tse Ka Chun.Looking over Herman Yau's filmography, he's quite the survivor of the Hong Kong industry. Reputable for bringing his films on budget and on time, Yau has worked consistently across a widespread of genres, releasing B movies quick enough to catch what's trending, such as undercover police thrillers or Ip Man follow-ups.Now as the go-to guy for Hong Kong-Mainland co-production action films, Yau's paint-by-numbers, veering towards televisual style is a commercial choice to create easy entertainment that everybody can follow-and probably puts the investors at ease. And Yau achieves that.However, it leaves a lot to be desired. We are all so familiar with cop films already. There's little attempt to deliver anything new or challenge its audience.The film constantly over-explains itself. Every line of dialogue either explains, reminds or plans out what needs to be done. There are flashbacks to scenes we have just seen. You could follow the entire story from listening while making dinner in the kitchen.Lau Ching Wan and Francis Ng deserve better material. That said, it's impressive watching the two veteran actors rise above the written material. They masterfully maneuver around their lines, adding nuances and gravitas in the silences.Producer Andy Lau disappears in a memorable cameo as a mentally unstable father who starts a crisis in the Social Welfare Department office with his wife. It's Lau's best recent performance.Yeung Wai Lun from The Sparring Partner is also funny as a police informant who becomes one of the hostages.The most memorable scene is Sean Lau taunting a novice police negotiator on the phone and it's the closest the film gets to letting loose and allowing the actors to play with the material. My theater erupted in laughter from the fresh and immediate energy.Everybody seems to be delivering these stale lines as written. How often can an actor and director explore a scene until it's right in these productions?Imagine if the production let Herman Yau, Sean Lau and Francis Ng chisel and tweak their scenes to create something more magical and exciting.At the bare minimum, I need to see that attempt.",6.0,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,2024-08-27,0.0,0.0

It's an interesting movie when you haven't watch the original hollywood movie or already forgot how that one goes.Lau Ching Wan doing his misunderstood cop roll, has currently kinda become his character in the last several films he has been in. Francis Ng for me felt out of place as a crisis negotiation as he is also known for mostly being a bad guy in triad movies as also he speaks in a certain way it quite hard to believe it goes well in negotiations.Personally would rather seen Lau Ching Wan as the retired Negotiator instead and either Nicholas Tse or some younger Male actor being the framed cop.

Ajay Ghosh's performance is both emotional and profoundly inspiring. He brings Murthy's character to life, carrying the entire film with his heartfelt portrayal. Chandini and Aamani also deliver strong performances within their roles. At times, Ajay Ghosh's portrayal of Murthy reminds me of Rajendra Prasad's role in ""Aa Naluguru.""In essence, this film is a well-narrated tale that inspires and reminds us of the unlimited potential within us.

A message that Christ is truly present in the Eucharist and a call to action for all Catholics to take part in this source and summit of the faith. Unfortunately, this film ends up being phoned in in the most spectacular of ways, leaving behind the documentary that it is meant to be and instead becoming a 90 or so minute commercial about the Eucharistic Congress and other Catholic events that are vaguely Eucharistic themed. It's as if they took 10-15 short promotional videos that Spirit Juice and other Catholic production companies create, mashed them together, and called it a documentary. There is very little story and almost no perceivable throughline. I legitimately fell asleep 20 minutes in and had to be shaken so I could watch the rest.It was not all bad. Many friends of mine (mostly responsible for the visuals) are in the credits working on this movie. I applaud them for their stunning cinematography and video work. There are also some really interesting places they go. The work of the Sisters of Life and the work done at the penitentiary are both fascinating subject matters. I just wish we could have had a deep dive into either one of those subjects rather than a surface level effort among 15 different subjects. Overall, I understand this was probably a rushed effort as the 10th Eucharistic Congress is less than a month away. It seems that the apparent lack of coordination in that event seems to pervade surrounding efforts. I just wish more of these Catholic productions could have more respect for their own work to see the films as more than just a means to an end.

You know what would be a way to make him look even more realistic? No, that would be too difficult, never mind, just go with Mr. Blue Eyes.It really undercuts your message and credibility to get such a basic thing wrong. How would we trust the meat of your message when you can't even cast the right host? How dare you change the depiction of the LITERAL BODY OF CHRIST in such a fundamental way. You've done a disservice to the faith through this film. You've allowed countless others to doubt the veracity of the Message through your utterly shameful casting of Christ. Shame. Shame. Shame.Why do you dare shake your fist in the face of God? He was the one who chose as the vessel for Christ a Middle Eastern body. By pretending that instead, He should have chosen a white American, you might as well condone Mormonism. Is that your intent?

1298506,No summary,"The film begins with a compelling introduction, efficiently laying out the characters, plot, and central conflict. The clarity in the initial exposition sets a solid foundation, ensuring that viewers grasp all essential details before the whirlwind of confusion, drama, and comedy unfolds-a narrative strategy that sustains its momentum through to the conclusion.However, the film falls short in delivering remarkable performances from its leads. Sunny Singh's portrayal is disappointingly uniform across his filmography; his character appears perpetually bewildered, and his acting seems effortless and uninspired. In stark contrast, Annu Kapoor delivers an outstanding performance, injecting much-needed humor and vitality, effectively carrying the film.While the movie boasts numerous comedic highlights, it suffers from predictability and a lack of originality in its storyline. The conclusion, in particular, is uninspired and hastily executed, attempting to evoke emotion but ultimately failing.In summary, this film merits a score of 5.

However, I can't fathom why they seemed forced to act as if at gunpoint.In this twisted romantic comedy, the leads start with a love-hate relationship. By the time they fall in love, they discover that the guy's widowed father has fallen for the girl's mother. Now, they must separate to arrange their parents' marriage.I can't get over the fact that the movie literally looks like a B-grade film. The story is outdated, and visually it resembles a cringe-worthy 90s movie. The logic has no correlation with the plot, as absurdity increases with every passing second. In the name of comedy, they serve you comedy worse than the comedy reels of few low grade influencers.Sunny Singh and Avneet Kaur are decent, but in such a poorly made movie, there was little they could do. Supriya Pathak does a fine job, and Annu Kapoor goes so overboard that you wonder how such a good actor could make a mockery of himself. Rajpal Yadav is in his element, but poor writing makes him look lame too. Paritosh Tripathi's character is too forced and most illogical.Ishrat R. Khan really needs a reality check and should reconsider directing movies in the future. The cinematography is so bad that you might check if the movie really released this year. While the sets look lavish and the costumes are appealing, the songs and choreography are nonsensical.You don't need an invitation for this ""marriage of Luv.""

Xu Dongdong leads the military team trying to overcome the challenges the invaders are throwing their way as well as some personal demons of her own but the price grows increasingly high.I can't point to any one thing that really stands out - the sets are cheap, the CGI goes between barely OK to passable video game level but the story did keep me from switching off.

1303550,No summary,"When I stumbled upon this 2024 Chinese action sci-fi movie, I have to admit that my first thought was 'great, another run-of-the-mill Chinese creature feature'. Yeah, the Chinese cinema has been flooded with creature features of very varying quality the recent years.But still, with ""The Captives"" being an Asian movie that I hadn't already seen, much less ever actually heard about, of course I opted to give the movie a fair chance, especially since I am a big fan of the Asian cinema in general.The storyline was pretty straightforward, but at the same time it was also a very generic action sci-fi script. So you're not in for anything revolutionizing.And the name of the alien invading race was Zerg. Yup, just like the alien race in the ""StarCraft"" computer games.Of the cast ensemble in the movie, I was only familiar with Hong Kong actor Eric Tsang. I have to say that it is beyond my comprehension how Dongdong Xu landed the leading role, as she is certainly not an overly talented actress, and she has one single expression throughout the course of the movie; constipated. The acting performances in the movie were, for the most parts, okay.Visually then you're not in for anything grand. The CGI effects in the movie doesn't look like they were made in 2024. The CGI was wobbly, questionable and sort of looked like a third or fourth attempt at a concept art for the alien design. Sort of think Xenomorphs from the ""Alien"" franchise infused with a hefty doze of Lovecraftian tentacled terror. Sure, it sounds very interesting, I will admit that, but the dubious CGI rendered left much to be desired. And with this being an action sci-fi movie with alien lifeforms taking over the Earth, special effects were a crucial part for a make or break deal.Semi-watchable, if you gobble all things extraterrestrial, but otherwise it was a rather generic action sci-fi movie. It is definitely not a movie that will find its way back to my screen a second time.My rating of director Frankie Chung's 2024 movie ""The Captives"" lands on a very generous three out of ten stars.",3.0,paul_haakonsen,2024-09-25,3.0,0.0
492200,No summary,"This is a beautiful film, directed by Sharon Sheehan who is one of the best directors I have worked with. Getting any film made these days is a mammoth task. And the work of talented women directors is always worth supporting. Sheehan wrote a wonderful script as well as directing and playing the title character. She did all three tasks with great applomb. Such stunning cinematography all on film, shot entirely on location in Lyme Regis and along the Jurassic coast of Dorset where the events occurred, is normally only to be found in much higher budget productions. But this is a micro budget Indie film of real integrity and great beauty. It tells the story with much more authenticity than the recent big budget Hollywood film on the same subject. Sheehan has assembled a cast of quality and Jenny Agutter shines with a luminous energy as a force for moral good among the venal snobbery amd self interest of a male dominated field, even now. But back then for a working class autodidact woman to achieve what she did is well worth honouring. Very Good performances from Sheehan herself, Hamilton, Storrier, Oliver, Jackie Howe ( in a wonderful and poignant last performance) Arundel et al. I saw the first public screening and The audience response was very good. The film has a meditative pace which really draws you in with beautiful, lingering shots. Scenes have time to develop. No. There are no car chases. Yes. Shots last longer than a few seconds. No explicit sex or physical violence, or cheap bells and whistles. Just a very moving and intelligent piece of film making which treats the audience as intelligent grown ups. This is well worth seeing for anyone interested in Cinema itself and the inspirational story of an outsider battling against all the odds. A final mention must go to the haunting, minimalist score by Einaudi. To secure the services of such a world famous artist is a major coup for Sheehan and her team.

His goal is to earn 1crore, only glitch is that he wants to do it honestly. He has an ailing mother and siblings to take care of. But he is targeted by a local goon Savukar, who offers him a deal which Kotee promptly declines. This leads to Savukar throwing multiple hurdles at Kotee, disrupting his life enough to force him to accept the deal. How does Kotee get out of this mess and why exactly he has chosen to be a honest man, forms rest of the story.Param has definitely come up with a near perfect characterization for Dhananjay and Kotee is definitely a praiseworthy character. The hero is an extremely nice guy till the very end and to hold onto that throughout, is a commendable job. But I wish the screenplay was better to compliment the lead hero character as the love story segment remains half baked and keeps distracting from the main plot. Even the family sentiment is dragged out like a tv serial and the slow paced narrative doesn't help the film being 2hrs 50mins which was simply too long. The supposed twist in the climax was so predictable, it didn't help elevate the climax.

1287250,No summary,"The third installment in the ""I Not Stupid"" series takes a disappointing turn with a sluggish pace and a lackluster storyline, failing to live up to the standards set by its predecessors. Unlike its predecessors, which managed to blend humor with poignant social commentary seamlessly, this installment struggles to find its footing.One of the most glaring issues is the film's tempo, which moves at an excruciatingly slow pace. This deliberate slowness does little to enhance the storytelling and instead contributes to a sense of dragging monotony throughout. Scenes that could have been engaging and dynamic fall flat due to the drawn-out pacing, making it difficult for the audience to stay invested in the narrative.Moreover, the storyline itself fails to capture the essence of what made the previous movies successful. While the first two films tackled issues of education, family dynamics, and societal pressures with wit and insight, this third installment lacks a cohesive narrative thread. The plot feels disjointed, jumping from one subplot to another without fully developing any of them. This fragmentation leaves the audience feeling disconnected from the characters and their journeys.Another disappointing aspect is the quality of the humor, which is described by many as ""kinda shit"" compared to the sharp wit of its predecessors. The jokes often fall flat, relying on tired clichés and predictable punchlines rather than the clever satire that defined the earlier films. This lack of effective humor further contributes to the overall sense of disappointment surrounding the movie.In addition to its pacing and storyline issues, the third ""I Not Stupid"" movie also struggles with character development. Unlike the well-rounded characters of the previous installments, the characters in this film feel underdeveloped and one-dimensional. They lack depth and complexity, making it difficult for the audience to empathize with their struggles or celebrate their victories.On a positive note, the film does attempt to address some relevant social issues, such as modern-day challenges faced by youth and families in Singapore. However, these attempts are overshadowed by the film's other shortcomings, preventing it from effectively resonating with its audience on a meaningful level.From a technical standpoint, the cinematography and production design maintain a certain level of competence, though they do little to elevate the overall viewing experience. The visual aesthetics, while polished, cannot compensate for the fundamental flaws in pacing, storytelling, and character development.Ultimately, the third installment of the ""I Not Stupid"" series disappoints on multiple fronts. Its slow pace, weak storyline, and lack of compelling characters undermine what could have been a worthy successor to its predecessors. Fans of the earlier films may find themselves let down by this installment's inability to recapture the magic that made the series beloved in the first place.In conclusion, while the first two ""I Not Stupid"" movies succeeded in blending humor with social commentary in a meaningful way, the third installment falls short. Its very slow pace and poorly developed storyline fail to engage the audience, resulting in a lackluster viewing experience. Fans of the series hoping for a triumphant return to form may be left feeling disappointed and underwhelmed by this latest entry.",1.0,junshenglim-02668,2024-07-07,6.0,1.0

However, his lack of elaboration as to why only steels to resolve to make this happen, eventually prompting him to reluctantly relent to her wishes. They thus set off for a weekend visit to the rural village of his parents (Gloria Young, Keppy Ekpenyong-Bassey) for their golden wedding anniversary celebration. Once there, though, his family's dark secrets slowly emerge, leading to the disclosure of shocking revelations that live up to all the advanced billing attributed to them. To say more would reveal too much, but suffice it to say that the trip discloses much more than what the young bride-to-be had bargained for. In telling this story, director Daniel Oriahi serves up a perfectly gruesome tale filled with lots of good scares and a deliciously macabre sense of humor that grows progressively more campy with each passing frame. Indeed, it's the kind of yarn that will leave viewers nervously laughing at events that they probably think they shouldn't be giggling about, but therein lies the film's carefully crafted guilty pleasure appeal. Admittedly, those qualities may not be as readily apparent as they probably ought to be in the picture's opening act, leaving audience members thinking that the narrative is unduly mean-spirited, but those developments are all integral to the setup for what's to come, a foundation that allows this offering's wicked humor to surface in all its grisly glory. The filmmaker deftly presents his material for maximum shock value but without becoming gratuitous or grotesque, quite a feat for a movie like this, one very much in line with the principles of Hitchcock's Rule that one's imagination is far more effective in conjuring ghastly images than anything the director could possibly depict on screen. ""The Weekend"" is thus one of those pictures that will evoke notions of what it feels like to whistle one's way through the graveyard at midnight on Halloween, leaving viewers with lots of good frights but nevertheless secure in the knowledge that they'll emerge from the theater well and intact, able to face yet another day, even if it means occasionally looking over their shoulder to see that there are no unwelcome relatives following them home.",7.0,brentsbulletinboard,2024-11-11,0.0,0.0

Kudos to the team Kuhudi presenting the harsh reality of small kids suffering for parental alienation and men suffering against those dominating women over false cases filed against them.2- one of the best performance from Anubhav Mohanty in term of acting and voice modulation,no complain this time. He has truly lived Anshuman Pattnaik's character..Dipanwit is brilliant throughout the film. Sukumar Tudu was excellent, whatever he was offered to do.. Supriya not much of screen time, still she justified her character. Kuna Tripathy was great 👍.3- cinematography at its best, Direction was good, Dialogues are well executed if we avoid those few bold dialogues.Screenplay is quite dull at first half, quite ordinary interval block, unnecessary placement of that romantic song between Anubhav and Supriya. I don't even understand someone had an argument with his wife regarding consumption of alcohol and she closes door and went straight to bed with her daughter, exactly after that sequence the romantic song comes. Complete blunder.. music was average,even if you go with this concept there could have another similar elevating song like satymeba jayate rather than that romantic track. Expected Sukumar Tudu's character more aggressive and dominating on few face off scenes with Anubhav Mohanty. I thought they could have taken more time for its post production work.. When you make a movie on a rush, these things happen . As it's a courtroom drama and quite bold in terms of dialogues, and very less mass appealing aspects, it might not have straight impact among audiences to watch during festive seasons.A solo release with proper promotion could have brought huge footfalls at the ticket windows.. nevertheless it still having decent business over this Raja weekend across many centers in the state .Overall a good movie and good content based subject with excellent social awareness. The team Kuhudi definitely needr espect for attempting a subject like this... This is a review as a neutral audience.

In addition, he used to be paired with popular heroines of that era like Revathi, Amala, Nadiya, Radha, Ambika among many others.Haraa movie proves that without the music of Ilaiyaraja, without the voice of S N Surendar, without a popular heroine, Mohan is a BIG ZERO. The movie fell flat. Owing his listless acting, pathetic action scenes, useless screenplay and clueless direction. Most of all, his appearance with a big beard is really irritating.Mohan should remain as a retired actor.

975223,No summary,"Haraa centres around Ram (a) Ibrahim who is grieving the loss of his daughter after she dies by suicide. He goes on a mission to uncover secrets and avenge her death. In the first scene, Mohan heads out to look for clues. He gets inside an auto, speaks to two or three people, and then into an ambulance when he sees a few people following him. After this, he gets onto a bike. Similarly, the screenplay moves from one pointless scene to another, mostly in circles, sometimes in triangles and at moments, all over the place. The story takes Ram through a gritty criminal world mired in ugly politics and a plethora of complications that come along with it. Instead of unravelling it in a way that tests the knowledge of a discerning audience, it holds exposition as a crutch to drag its way through the plot, eventually killing suspense and other elements that would have made it much more interesting.At the crux of Haraa is a dad-daughter love story that deserves better writing. Sometimes, the film takes their relationship a tad too far. When I say too far, it goes to the extent of mistaking patriarchy and regressive mentality for love and progressiveness. In perhaps the most bizarre scene of them all, Ram goes to Nimisha's school to tell the teachers that she won't be able to attend the exam as she had her menarche. Even when the teachers reiterate that they would provide her with sanitary products to help her deal with it, he denies it and agrees on her behalf to skip a year of education. In the raging debate around menstrual leaves, women have always asserted their choice, but for a man to speak in her name only takes the conversation back to a few decades. Speaking of it, even the parents finding out about her menarche is straight out of a '90s film.Haraa attempts to paint Mohan as a simple man who goes to great lengths to avenge the death of his daughter. But the film thrusts lyrics like ""Maassuke maasu Ivan, Silver Jubilee star ivan,"" clearly picturing him as a hero making a comeback. In another scene, Mohan beats several goons in a bus. He delivers one blow to a guy's face and Rajendran goes, ""Mouna Raagam parakudhe."" The botched meta-commentary goes on. There's another blow and he says, ""Mella Thirandhadhu un mandai."" Apart from Rajendran, there are Yogi Babu, Deepa Shankar, Singampuli, and Aadhavan who cross paths with Mohan at different intervals to provide what the makers thought would be 'comic relief'. Instead, they stick out like a sore thumb and are completely out of place. The dialogues don't help either and are a desperate cry to help fix the screenplay which is stretched so far to encompass several elements that remain as fragments in an already convoluted storyline. Adding to it are several lip-sync and messy dubbing issues. Anumol, who had an earnest performance in Ayali, is terribly underutilised. Worse, she is made into a classic, overly sentimental mother.",10.0,angelinpriyadarshini,2024-06-22,2.0,1.0

934214,No summary,"I went to watch it tentatively considering the absurdity that's been a hallmark of action movies in Lollywood. But to my surprise from the word go, there was substance to capture the audience. The makers had to work on various levels. Executing fantasy under the umbrella of factual scientific theories of metaphysics must have been a challenge that was compassed to perfection! (A treat for a marvel and dc fan like me). Moreover, the contemporary touch that was imbibed to a folk lore was commendable. Vfx which could have made the experience ludicrous despite a crisp script and deft acting actually turned out to be a great merit toward the whole feel of the movie. The makers were actually able to create a mood around the whole thing. Usman Mukhtar had a firm grasp over his character by virtue of which there was eurythmic portrayal of both the lighter and intense side of the protagonist. Ali Kazmi, Sanam Saeed and Mr. Sehbai were all great too in their respective roles! Faran Tahir requires a special mention for how he made such a difficult role look so easy and did not let it go out of hand with some meticulous handling! All in all a pleasant surprise! Go out and support the laudable indigenous efforts of good movie-making and have a cinematic treat as a compliment!",10.0,arslanmasoud-11961,2024-06-21,0.0,0.0

The visual and technical aspects are commendable and hint at what could be achieved with better scripts and performances. On the bright side, I enjoyed the Deadpool trailer and definitely plan to watch that. Hopefully, future projects will learn from these shortcomings and deliver more compelling content.

This is a reason quite good enough for its success.Cenima was full, clapping,routing and cheering for the Ayyars, that too in Cinegold, Baharia town;Rawalpindi.The plot, Story , Dialogue and cast were flawless.I was so impressed with the theatrics. Story was good and the interlinkimg of scenes was apt. There were no gaps and no fill in the blanks. The movie forced me as a viewer to consider matching up some scenes with Harry Potter and Spider wick chronicles but, then guys yay tou apni film hai!!The true essence came into being with Osman's soft image, geek & a coward to Umroo. WOW!Danyal, Sana, Sanam,Ali , Salamat and Hamza ... these guys worked amazingly .Seeing Mazhar sb , Seemi G and Farhan Tahir sb left their mark on the film
It made me go back to the days when I used to read these novels and the story of Kohkahf , Umroo and ayyars and their tales which were of centuries old, The element of Witches & Magic, Jinns and parees, a touch of mystery , Sci-fi and good fights with KAMAAL sound effects.If truly appreciated , Not politicised and cornered then yes we will be seeing many a sequels.Now if we discuss it in detail.Costumes ... they had quite an old rustic but yet Star Trek look. Liked the attire with the weapons which were obviously darts & Daggers , axes & blades of all sorts.Music was too good and well orchestrated.Story was basic as the writer is building a Step 1 for the sequels. An Intro.Plot was haf its share of suspense, a few twists of magic and Sci-fi which keeps one intrigued whats next.Action was updated with good sound effects and real like fights. Impressed me.A wonderful appearance by Farhan Tahir sb who graced our cenima after Hollywood.Hamza Ali Abbasi made it all come to sensibility with light humor and intrigue.Sana had her mystery aura which made me watch her chanting away ... what a witch !!Sanam reminded me of, "" Lara Croft""
Daniyal was the element of surprise .Ali and Salamat you guys were fantastic.Seemi apa true love, few words and her eyes tell the tale.Mazhar sab! Kia kehnay hai.I'm sorry don't want to tell the story but just trying my best to compel you all to go out and support our cenimatic achievements.

Honestly this movie should be watched just to ensure that these vfx artists can keep working on movies in the futureOnly real negative things I can say about this movie is that the main hero doesn't really sell me the idea that he's an action hero, reminded me more of a po/neo type of character and those scenes where he has doubts are where he's at his best imo.Definitely a great film for pretty much all generations while also being family friendly.",10.0,slavicjava,2024-06-19,0.0,0.0

934214,No summary,"""Umro Ayyar,"" directed by Azfar Jafri, attempts to bring a beloved historical character from Urdu literature to the big screen. Featuring an ensemble cast including Usman Mukhtar, Faran Tahir, Ali Kazmi, Adnan Siddiqui, and Simi Raheal, the film aspires to introduce Pakistan's first superhero franchise. However, despite its ambitious goals and notable efforts in visual effects and action sequences, the film falls short in several critical areas, making it an uneven and ultimately disappointing experience.Story and Plot
The narrative begins with a promising premise: in every era, 'ayyars' battle against evils. Amar, our hero, portrayed as a physics teacher, discovers a frequency that can repel jins. After an attack from dark forces, Amar is taken to a distant land by a guru, where he learns to harness his inner strength to confront Laka, the ultimate evil of the present age. The story hints at Amar's lineage, revealing his father as a savior of the ayyars who united them against malevolence.However, the plot suffers from a lack of coherence and direction. Characters seem to lack clear motives, and the narrative often meanders without purpose. Key plot elements, such as the motif (an ancient locket given to Amar by his father), are introduced but never fully explained or integrated into the story. The film tries to pack in too many elements from Hollywood without developing a strong, original narrative of its own.Characters and Execution
The characters in ""Umro Ayyar"" are underdeveloped and inconsistent. Amar's transformation from a teacher to a superhero is unconvincing, and his powers and abilities are never clearly defined. The evil character, played by Sana, has the ability to turn friends into foes with a simple blow, yet this power's application is erratic and unexplained, For instance, during a fight, her magic affects only one person, while others remain inexplicably unaffected. In the climactic last scene, just as the momentum builds towards the final showdown, it is abruptly broken. Amar suddenly finds himself in a surreal location, seemingly between heaven and earth, where he meets the real Umro Ayyar who supposedly died centuries ago as depicted in folklore. This ancient hero tells Amar to prepare for his next battle against the irresistible magicians of Kohi Kaaf, further disrupting the narrative flow and leaving the audience puzzled.Supporting characters often show more energy and decision-making ability than the hero himself, undermining Amar's role as the central figure.The film's humor attempts fall flat, and there is a noticeable lack of emotional depth and character development. This absence of an emotional journey for the characters prevents the audience from engaging with their struggles and triumphs. One moment, a character behaves one way, and the next, they act in a completely contradictory manner, making it difficult to connect with or understand their motivations.Visual Effects and Action Sequences
While the film does make an effort to incorporate high-quality visual effects and action sequences, many of these elements feel derivative and borrowed from popular Hollywood films such as ""Harry Potter,"" ""Thor,"" and ""Spiderman."" The lack of originality in these sequences detracts from the film's overall impact. Despite some well-executed scenes, the VFX often seem out of place and fail to blend seamlessly with the story.Dialogue and Conceptualization
The dialogue, particularly the guru's explanations in scientific terms and philosophical dilemmas, is overly complex and difficult to follow. This creates a barrier for the average Pakistani cinema-goer, who may find it challenging to grasp the concepts being discussed. The film's attempt to blend science and mysticism often results in confusion rather than clarity.Conclusion
In conclusion, ""Umro Ayyar"" is a commendable effort to bring a classic hero to the silver screen, but it struggles with an ordinary plot, inconsistent characters, and a lack of emotional engagement. The film's attempt to lay the groundwork for a sequel is unconvincing and feels forced. Despite its high aspirations and some notable visual effects, ""Umro Ayyar"" ultimately fails to deliver a cohesive and compelling story. The potential for a great Pakistani superhero franchise remains untapped, and future efforts will need to focus on stronger storytelling, character development, and originality to truly captivate audiences.",4.0,Hammad-Hassan,2024-06-18,5.0,4.0

There are various build-ups in the film DNA, such as the greatest story of the century. It was never worth telling this tale. It follows the same formula as previous serial killer films. The performance in this film is its primary component. The main actors are utterly useless in their parts. The supporting cast members performed their parts flawlessly. Retaliation is the film's central theme. The movie's main character must get his revenge. However, the actor's lack of preparation and the ridiculously overdone lines truly made every scene chaotic.

934214,No summary,"A must watch.Pakistan's first attempt at making a superhero movie based on Tilism-e-Hoshruba an Urdu recension of a persian classic the Hamzanama.In comparison to the best of Marvel or DC I would have rated the movie 5 which is pretty good for a first try. I went for a 7 because of the same reason and the fact that great effort has been observed from the part of the producers and all other people involved in the film and not to even mention the beautiful CGIs. Never thought we would get to see something of this quality in Pakistani cinema but here we are. One step at a time.It should be emphasised that much more could have been done to make the movie better. Especially in the story writing, story telling and direction department. Characters were unnecessarily expressive at times especially when it came to being angry. Too many borrowed Clichy's, we need more novel ideas than were in this film. Also there was too much English being spoken, should definitely minus that part in the sequel, It is embarrassing how instead of keeping things traditional and culturally relevant there were unnecessary and cringy attempts to westernize things. Aim your things at the regular people and they will come. Instead of bikes could have used a flying carpet. Instead of English could have used Persian, it would have made more sense. Costume design seemed too middle eastern and Mediterranean at times with little basis in south Asian culture and tradition. Usman Mukhtar's character in his fathers suit looked like some ancient roman warrior without the helmets.Acting by Usman Mukhtar, Hamza Ali Abbasi and Farhan Tahir was the best from the lot but still requires more attention. It was over done at times and underwhelming in places. Also I think, Hamza Ali Abassi's character should be more involved in the sequel if any. He did well. His character seemed much more interesting than Usman Mukhtars.Nevertheless I would recommend everyone to go and watch this movie, its quite entertaining and unique in the sense that you will never see a movie that is about a superhero but also contains jinns, Ifrits and demons and is rooted in cultural traditional beliefs of the people of that land. Its our duty to help the producers recover the amount put into making this film with aesthetically pleasing visual and CGI also to ensure that they can come back stronger the next time with a larger budget and significant improvements hopefully.",7.0,RougeTerminator,2024-06-18,3.0,6.0

1304113,No summary,"DNA, the latest Malayalam movie directed by TS Suresh Babu and written by AK Santhosh, is like watching the return of all the cliched scripting tropes from the dustbin. Starring actor Mammootty's nephew Ashkar Saudan in the lead role, the movie is a colossal disappointment by all means, and the writing that is extremely old school would make the whole experience a tiring one. With an outdated making and a series of forgettable performances, DNA, at best is a roast-worthy comedy.So Lakshmi Narayanan and Hannah are RJs in a leading radio station in Kochi. The newly joined police commissioner, Rachel Punnose, is given the charge of the investigation of a brutal killing where a young man was murdered in a very heinous way. More murders started to happen in a similar fashion, and since there was a pendrive inside the mouth of each victim, the police coined the term ""pendrive killings."" How Rachel Punnose cracked the killer is what we see in the movie DNA.SPOILER ALERT! When the movie shifts to Kochi and we are introduced to our hero Lakshmi Narayan, as an RJ, I immediately felt like asking who hired him as an RJ. The diction and the energy in the performance were so odd and off that he might have been the last one in the shortlisted list of RJ candidates. Well, the hero's casting is not really the most irritating thing about this revenge thriller. The writing is so bad in terms of structuring that AK Santhosh is not even making the slightest effort to create some moments of suspense. We have this Poor man's Batman with clothes bought from Meesho and a terribly designed mask, killing men one after the other. The writing talent of Mr. AK Santhosh is such that he would make you think the movie will obviously not make the hero the vigilante, and later he will reveal that the hero himself is the masked man! I mean, what a thought! That thought never crossed our minds.During most of the promotion interviews for this movie, every anchor mentioned how Ashkar Saudan looked similar to the Mammootty of the '80s and how the bass in his voice was very impressive. Well, Ashkar has successfully proved that having a great voice and being able to modulate it effectively are entirely different things. In terms of being able to carry the swagger, the man is giving tough competition to Maqbool Salman. Hannah Reji Koshy's character is more like a very evident decoy from the word go. Raai Laxmi as Rachel Punnose is there more for glamour reasons than performance. There is a very minimal improvement in the performance of Padmaraj Ratheesh. Dialogues given to the character played by Riyas Khan were so terrible and hilarious that the Filmyshek guy would scream his lungs out ""Content!""",10.0,angelinpriyadarshini,2024-06-22,0.0,0.0

The movie opens with a woman in the audience who was upset by the play, clearly distressed, and yelling at him about how he doesn't understand the challenges that she has been through in her life and felt blamed for being white. He responds to her by saying that the play is not about her but ""just about these eight people up here."" He then goes on to say that it is ""a metaphor"" but ""just about these eight people,"" seemingly to be momentarily forgetting the meaning of metaphor. After the woman storms out, he mocks her to the entire audience.He offers insights into the depth of his thinking with soliloquies along the lines of, ""Theater is, like, my life, you know. Like I breath it and live it, and like it is everything for me, and, you know, like, theater is, like...you know?"" He talks about how he reads all sorts of random things online and has ""like a million tabs open all the time,"" implying, somehow, that this is evidence of his profundity. He speaks with an air of thick pretentiousness, like a first year college student gracing their audience with their nascent socio-political awareness.

Most of the film is devoted to watching Harris talk ad nauseum about himself to a group of actors; I found his hyperactive, stream-of-consciousness, all-over-the-place manner become increasingly grating as the film progressed. In one particular scene the actors are shown sitting with their backs to him and they look as though they've become as weary and annoyed with hearing him talk about himself as I had.What was the purpose of making this film?

In this movie, it takes a while for the central dynamic of the plot to come to the fore while at the same time we figure out the family relationships of some of the characters. Early on, we understand that the male and female lead are in a healthy relationship but beset by challenges. The man loves his wife and at seventy-three he is still desirous of her; he uses the Hebrew word (echoed in the movie's title) that is translated as ""covet"" in the tenth commandment. And that kind of desire is contrasted, not too strongly, against the insatiable hormones of youth; and there's also the bond between parents and children thrown into the mix, and love out of bounds, and even the lust for money.

Daniela is from Colombia, and Lorena is from Venezuela. Daniela has been cleaning houses for a while, and one day, she teams up with newly hired Lorena to do household work for their company. Daniela is more mature and serious, taking her work seriously and with honesty, while Lorena is still trying to figure out what to do.

To find out more you need to watch the movie.The film's strength lies in its performances. Dalma Llinas and Yiseth Brendlinger bring a raw authenticity to their roles, capturing the vulnerability and strength of immigrants with their own ambitions and fears.

With Lime and Vinegar, he presents the struggles of immigrants and how they make a life in the USA. His films stand out for their improvised performances,capturing raw, authentic moments that challenge conventional cinema. Snyder's dedication to slow cinema is remarkable.Lime and Vinegar is not without flaws.

1286547,No summary,"This is a movie that I got the chance to see thanks to Justin Cook who sent it over via a screener. Now ahead of watching this, I confirmed that it was in the horror genre. Other than that, I came in blind and was surprised to see what type of movie this is. I will go vague to avoid spoilers.Synopsis: a combat veteran returns home after a tour of duty overseas. He becomes the lead suspect in his girlfriend's disappearance. He's wrongly convicted and years later, returns home to find the truth as well as to settle the score.We start this off with Jake Morgan (Britt Bankhead), who is the soldier returning from duty. He is with his girlfriend, Samantha Davis (Grace Patterson). She has a secret that she wants to tell him but isn't sure how he will react. Waiting for them is her brother, Will (Paul Kolker), and his girlfriend, Erica (Marie Wetherell). This is for a surprise party at a local hotel that is closed. It is referred to as 'Massacre Hotel' since over the years so many people have gone missing there.This night becomes a nightmare though when people are attacked. I won't give away what the cause is, but Jake, Will and Erica are the only ones to get out. The local sheriff is played by Eric Roberts. Will and Sam are his children. He doesn't believe Jake's story and has him committed to a local asylum.His treatment there isn't good. He sees images of Sam asking him to get out and save her. Dr. Stoker (Jack Maxwell) oversees his care and thinks that the treatments are working. Jake also lies about his hallucinations. He does get out and he heads straight back to this town.Things have changed though. Sheriff Davis is still in charge but now Will is one of his deputies. There is another sibling, Crystal (Samantha Reddy), who is attending the local college and close to graduating. She is seeing Haydin (River Perkins). They're friends with Josie (Meg Hobgood) and Jon (Blake Higdon).The disappearances haven't stopped either. This group of teens are attacked at a party. Jake saves Crystal and Haydin. The former isn't sure if she should hate him. Her boyfriend despises him like her father and brother. Jake will do what he can to prevent others from dying, but he needs to find the root of what is causing the disappearances and take it on before others are claimed.That should be enough to recap what we're getting here and introduce the characters without going into spoilers. What I'll say there is that I'm glad that I came in blind. There's another movie that was released this year that is like what we're getting here. I'll say that it has less of an impact here, because we learn within the first ten minutes. I still would rather play it close to the vest if anyone reading this is interested in seeing it play out.Now I do think that we have good things that we're using for the story. I love the idea of a soldier returning home and then getting caught up in what happens. He is highly trained, but still going up against something stronger than him. It also makes sense with how easily Sheriff Davis gets him committed. I do know that it isn't that easy, especially since it isn't voluntary. It works for me since this is a small town and with reveals at the end. There's more going on behind the scenes and the idea of PTSD makes it easier to believe. This is a relevant concept that fits.Having him be in the asylum for nine years is interesting as well. The only issue there is that the characters don't seem to age. I know looking back almost a decade, I look the same, but also different. That is a nitpick since they did that to have Crystal be an adult. She was around 13 at the time of this initial incident.The last bit of the story will be with the 'Massacre Hotel'. I love that we got introduced to this through a local television host. That was good for a quick backstory. It is later that Jake states how this place has its own 'H. H. Holmes'. The characters around him don't know who that is, but it is a fun thing for those that do. It explains why bodies aren't found. There's another reason with it that we will learn. I do love that small town mentality of taking care of your own and how they cover things up. Makes me think of where I'm from.I'll then go to the acting. I'm not going to harp too much, but it isn't great. I did think that Bankhead was solid as our hero. I do like blurring the lines of his psyche though so we don't know if it is due to his time in the military. Roberts is fine in his role as the sheriff. Patterson and Reddy are both attractive. They're not given a lot to work with. But they do pass for sisters for me. They're also the catalysts here. Maxwell is fine in his minor role. Kolker, Hobgood, Wetherell, Perkins and the rest of the cast also rounded this out for what was needed.The last thing then is filmmaking. I thought that the cinematography was fine. It does capture the small town feel that we need. The practical effects that we got were decent. The best are the look of the creatures. It is subdued, but it looks good enough. My issue comes from the CGI that is used for blood spray and other things. This is working with a lower budget, so I get it. It just takes me out of what I'm seeing. The pacing is also off here. I don't feel the urgency and things on camera unfold too slowly. It made sense for the opening. That comes back though later for me as the tension just isn't raised.In conclusion, I thought that this had a decent premise. We're taking lore that we've seen throughout the history of the horror genre. It is making its own story. There are slight issues with setting up its lore though. The idea of taking a soldier, fresh from combat and questioning his sanity is interesting. The acting performances are fine. No one is great. This has slight issues with filmmaking for me. I like the look of the monsters, but the pacing is off and the CGI doesn't work for me. If you like low budget, independent cinema, I'd recommend this to you. If not, avoid this one.My Rating: 5 out of 10.",5.0,Reviews_of_the_Dead,2024-06-13,3.0,1.0

1286547,No summary,"After being released from a psychiatric hospital, a war veteran committed for the disappearance of his girlfriend originally conducted by a coven of vicious vampires sets out to find them again, and when he finds them targeting the girlfriends' younger sister tries to stop them once and for all.This was a solid if somewhat problematic genre effort. One of the best features here is the uneventful if serviceable storyline featuring the type of action necessary to move this one along at a solid clip. The main setup of the initial attack turning everyone in town against him to the point that he gets institutionalized rather than deal with the truth of the situation gives this a fine starting point as the series of interactions here make for a good enough piece about his condition affecting the reputation of the incidents. Since his prognosis helps out with the idea of the vampires staying hidden as no one believes him, the sympathy generated here is rather nice when it becomes apparent that there's a hidden meaning behind everything that slowly gets revealed the longer this goes on. The other big issue here is the strong vampire action that takes place here where it's confrontations involving the guy taking down the coven. The initial setup with the hotel party getting to wipe out the series of guests while also offering a rather likable series of setups that point him as a scapegoat for the massacre so everything is handled quite nicely as a fantastic starter. The later scenes offering his attempts to get the creatures to let him know where they're hiding out which also serves as a way to bring the younger sister into this film has some fun with the chaotic action of the frenzied vampires going crazy grabbing whoever they can and taking them out in graphic fashion. When the finale manages to bring about some intriguing action and plenty of reveals that have a great impact on the storyline, these come together to give the film a lot to like. There are some drawbacks with this one that hold it back. The main issue here is the fact that this one spends way too much time on the idea of trying to build up the wrongful incarceration idea and him being released to a corrupt police unit that just doesn't have the kind of immersive setup at the beginning of this one. The whole idea of framing him for the crimes gets more context later on but it's all so flimsy in the first half that there's nothing inherently logical about the whole incident when the exploits of the crime became noticeable with him being held in contempt for the whole thing following this along. The other issue here which piggybacks off of that is the slow pace at the same time so it takes a while to get these features involving some underwhelming elements making this take a while to get going which bring this down.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",7.0,kannibalcorpsegrinder,2024-06-06,3.0,2.0

However, when he is caught in three love entanglements-one involving his father's love interest, another his own, and the third an unconventional love of someone he knows-he struggles to navigate the situation.The story starts on a good note with fun banter between the father and son, extending to their innocent neighborhood. However, it begins to lose direction, leaving the audience disconnected. It gets back on track when the issues come to the forefront, but once everything is established, it falls apart due to poor writing. The plot was interesting and had all the ingredients for a fun, light-hearted watch, but the poor screenplay made it a disappointing experience.Shane Nigam, as an actor, has done full justice to his role. He fully embodies the character and makes viewers root for him. Similarly, Baburaj has an interesting role and performs well. Mahima Nambiar, Renji Panicker, and Parvathi Malaa have limited screen time, but they are decent in their parts. Shine Tom Chacko, though with less screen presence, deserves commendation for choosing different subjects.The album is good and fits the narrative perfectly. The serene setting of the movie makes it cinematically beautiful. The opening credit animation is creatively done and efficiently introduces the characters. The movie also addresses the LGBTIQA+ community in a sincere manner without stereotyping or exaggeration. Bringing such stories to the mainstream is commendable.This would have been a good experience if the screenplay had been stronger, but unfortunately, it faltered there.

First is the all-time seen done and dusted hero heroine romance, the second is a man who is in mid-50's a widower falls in love with a lady who is estranged from her husband & the final one is a gay couple romance.From the above, only better which I felt is the love relationship between the widower and the lady but that too in another version we had seen in Dileep's earlier movie ""Ishtam"" (Love) wherein the protagonist father a widower accidentally meets his first love wherein love blossoms again in his heart and how they unite was all about that movie. When coming to ""Little Hearts"" we could see the film takes through a similar kind of journey but still watchable flick.But the film fails to deliver anything new. Accepting of same sex relationship in a family bounded by the traditional values later with the time & situation accepting whole heartedly this had really become outdated & the movie fails in it.Coming over to the performance, Shane Nigam had delivered a good performance. A boy next door image had been felt by watching his performance.

When he first showed me Scott Lobaido, it was in the form of videos that were just full of foul language and a ridiculous amount of arrests. For me it was just very off putting and I couldn't stand it when he would talk about him. I was hesitant about watching the movie because I thought that's all it would be. I WAS SO WRONG. The movie portrayed just how much Scott Lobaido loves America. He loves the veterans, the American flag, and stands for what is right. He may protest in extreme ways, but he shows the world what America should be like. We should be united and we should be standing for our flag instead of burning it and disrespecting it. One of the most amazing things he talked about was how everything we do and how we do it wouldn't be possible without those that are fighting for our freedom. He has the most amazing art and shows his love for America through it. Does he cuss a lot? Sure, but it is because of his passion for the flag and the veterans. It was amazing to see just who Scott Lobaido is.Christopher Martini the entire film was shot and put together so well. I see the hard work you have put into it and I wish that everyone could see it and understand just how much love and passion you have for America as well.

1260698,No summary,"Christopher Martini bravely and masterfully executes the most pivotal topic of this generation through his documentary of the conservative, patriotic activist Scott LoBaido, who for more than 30 years has been a force to be reckoned with, expressing his love for America through his energetic artwork. Millions have served and died for this country for the values that shaped our nation as a Republic, and we continue to hold dear, yet are on the verge of losing. Whatever emotions it engenders in your soul, the message is clear. Collectively we must not let that happen, and his fight is OUR fight! The enemy is within our ranks. Kudos to Chris and to the Guiding Force that propels him to use his remarkable talents, his film-art medium, to bring the same level of energy to rise up ALL patriots and rally them to the cause.",10.0,bvdmorris,2024-06-16,6.0,0.0

Babushan as a lead actor had never disappointed his supporters, but in this film his performance was not as powerful as it should be . Elina's performance was spot on, she was really fitting very well in her character. The other characters shown in the film were quite good such as the characters played by Krishna Kar , Udit Guru & Choudhury Jayaprakash etc . In my opinion Ashok pati has failed to leave an impact on the climax. The execution idea of the courtroom drama was really stupid . I mean which lawyer & judge does such stupid behaviour in a court??2. AUTHENTICITY :
I feel films like PABAR should be executed in such a way that the authenticity of the film plot won't be sacrificed. The entire team of the movie has taken this point very seriously and they have done a great job to maintain the authenticity of the film from location to costume , crowd artist , the way of talking everything was spot on.3. STORY:
To revive the odia film industry, the story should be the main hero of a film . In this film the story was very average. No extraordinary story is shown in the film.

1306301,No summary,"In a field with very few good narrative or documentaries focused on the sport of amateur wrestling, ""All American"" stands out as a powerful and inspiring film. Women's wrestling is the fastest-growing sport in the nation right now, and this film follows three high school girls from diverse backgrounds in underprivileged New York City neighborhoods as they navigate the challenges of life, family, friends, and the sport. The film explores themes of hard work, resilience, and self-respect, while also addressing cultural and familial pressures. Through their journey, the girls learn valuable life lessons and strive to overcome adversity. The film also honors a pioneering female wrestler who faced her own battles against stereotypes in a male-dominated sport, offering a broader perspective on the struggles and triumphs of women in wrestling.

1306301,No summary,Saw this at the lighthouse film festival and was surprised at how much I loved it. Incredibly touching and didn't expect it to be funny at times (cuz not a comedy). Please don't miss it. I'm not a big fan of women's wrestling but so so entertaining and film about so much more. It was very unexpected. This is a special treat.I tried to submit but this review needs to be longer and only writing so much cuz this needs to have more in it.... But I really haven't seen a movie this entertaining (and no sex-very clean) in years.Filmmaker was there with some of his 'cast' which was a treat to hear them speak and talk about where in life they are now - but at the end of film the director states this too. Anyway - such a fun film.,10.0,babslangdon,2024-06-10,1.0,0.0

I saw him at the Golden Globes where he bombed hard and blamed his writers for the jokes they gave him. This alone was enough for me to dislike him, because... what standup comedian doesn't come up with his own jokes??? And even worse - how could you blame the writers for delivering a bad joke? Either take the gig and come up with your own jokes or don't take it at all.Anyway, Netflix recommended this to me like 300 times so I decided to give it a chance. I didn't really expect it to be hilarious, but it's actually even worse than I could ever imagine.The whole show feels like an hour-long intro to an actual comedy show. It's as if the ""What's up Brooklyn, how are you tonight"" went on for an hour. Mild, flat jokes that seem to never end in a punchline. Hell, he talked for 5 minutes about how if you're not laughing at his jokes, you should die tomorrow.Do not waste your time with this.

His portrayal of these psychopathic narcissist characters has reached a level where it is genuinely unsettling.Arna Mukhopadhyay, Sohini Sarkar and the rest of the cast also delivers truly brilliant performances.The direction and choice of screenplay were exceptional. However, what truly stood out was the cinematography. The lighting in each scene is particularly noteworthy. The use of colour, shadows and lighting to create mood and tension is masterful.The camera work introduces a fresh perspective to Bengali cinema. Anirban breaking the fourth wall is innovative and adds an intriguing layer to the storytelling. This approach, combined with the overall narrative style, offers a unique viewing experience that stands out in the realm of Bengali cinema. It is a bold move that pays off.Despite the many positive aspects, there are a few criticisms. The most significant issue is the lack of clarity regarding Gogo's motive. This ambiguity leaves a somewhat sour taste. Although there was some hint, a more explicit exploration of his motivations would have added depth to his character and provided a more satisfying conclusion to the story.

1112555,No summary,"I had one nagging doubt, going in for 'Atthoi'. One litmus test, if you may. Would the film be effective for an audience that had never read 'Othello'? (Or watched 'Omkara' for that matter?)For the most part, the answer is in the affirmative, and I can't be happier about it. Arna Mukherjee's directorial debut (adapted from the now-famous theater play) is raw, moody, and entirely cinematic. Overstylized and indulgent, for sure. But entertaining nonetheless. It almost takes you by surprise from the get-go. The Bangla cinema audience is so used to mediocrity at this point, that a project that attempts anything remotely cinematic amazes us instantly.'Atthoi', with its constant fourth-wall breaking, smart camera work, gorgeous visuals, and amazing musical score, grabs the audience by their throats and pulls them into the world of 'Vinsura'. It's hard to escape the intensity that the movie unleashes from the very beginning, and you can't help but surrender to this understated stage play and its never-ending barrage of tension.It's an enthralling theatrical experience with Anirban Bhattacharya, pulling off an all-timer of a performance. He is in exemplary form in this movie. Single-handedly transforming 'Atthoi' into a one-man show. A solo play of sorts, where he screams, shouts, cries, and abuses in rampant feats of villainy. He chews the scenery with glee and hams it up, cartoonishly, whenever the occasion calls for it.It's effective. His motivations are vague. His intentions are disdainful. The connivance makes your skin crawl. The performance does the maximum heavy lifting in elevating the end product. So much so that Arna's portrayal of Atthoi ends up falling short of the mark. Him and Sohini's Diamona (and their undercooked arcs) seem pale, and devoid of chemistry when compared to Anirban and his manic take on Gogo. Almost like a proverbial double-edged sword that cuts both ways.The dialogue is intriguing. Hit-or-miss, at times. Sometimes crude, sometimes prone to expository soliloquys, considering the scope of the venture. Several sensitive topics are broached as well. Some, like cast identities and colorism, take precedence, staying true to the original source material. While others, like poverty and social oppression, are introduced but not really explored beyond the basic surface level. Mostly in favor of the tantalizing relationship drama.Or, as Gogo calls it, 'The Game' and its dismal repercussions.However, the runtime makes its presence felt by the end. There's a shallow attempt at commercialisation that doesn't really work out for the movie. The screenplay drags on by the second half. The engagement falters as the tension slackens. The movie parades slowly towards the 'Tragedy of Atthoi' and you can sense the gloom taking over. The penultimate descend feels slightly repetitive and rushed as well. Thus, the weaker (see : loopy/fantastical) ending stretch makes this one a 4-star watch. Not one star less, not one more.As such, go out and watch 'Atthoi' for all it's pent-up angst. Watch it for the moody shots of winter vistas and decaying humanity. Watch it for the subtle homoerotic tension seeping through. Watch it in theaters to experience something fresh and visually rewarding in the Bengali language. God knows, the industry needs more of this. God knows, we, the ticket payers, do as well.More of this. Fingers crossed.",8.0,dastiyas,2024-06-22,0.0,1.0

And the SMH references & roastings of some leading vet Celebs was like the litmus test for Wayans' emotional extremes.Those ""oh boyyy wow-did he go there jokes"" I saw them as exaggerated takes on his own everlasting & overwhelming Grief...

1129025,No summary,"As ""Power of the Dream"" (2024 release; 94 min.) opens, it is ""August 27,2020"" and the WNBA players refuse to play after Jacob Blake, yet another young Black male, is shot in the back by a white police officer. The documentary then goes back to the early days when the league was started in 1996. At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the documentary.Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary directed by Dawn Porter (""John Lewis: Good Trouble""). It is co-produced by several WNBA players, including Sue Bird. Here Porter looks back at the tumultuous year that was 2020, when the world as we knew stopped (due to COVID 19) and the police brutality on Blacks reached levels unimaginable, while at the same time a presidential and congressional elections were unfolding also in ways unimaginable. In the midst of it all, the players of the WNBA decide to use their platform to tell the world what they thought of it all. The most interesting aspect of it all is the Kelly Loeffler, majority owner of the Atlanta Dream and gifted a seat in the US Senate, decides to go all in on Trump and MAGA, to fight off the upstart campaign for that all-important US Senate seat by Rafael Warnock, a Black pastor. Let's just say this right here and now: ""Power Of the Dream"" is NOT a sports documentary. It is a political documentary about how WNBA players (of which most of them are Black) use their platform to broadcast their political views. As such this makes for a powerful documentary. It also is a stark reminder why insanely shocking the year 2020 turned out to be in so many ways.""Power of the Dream"" premiered at this year's Tribeca Film Festival to immediate critical acclaim. It started streaming on Amazon Prime a few weeks ago. The documentary is currently rated 100% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, which feels a bit too generous to me.

Even if you do not skateboard I recommend watching this film and understanding the secret narrative that exists within the art. I hope the soundtrack comes out on vinyl! Watch it loud!

I have never written a review for any title so far. But I am writing this review just out of moral obligation. I tried to watch it just out of curiosity to see what is the hype regarding the recent criticism against this drama. I have watched a lot of bangla serials, had endured a huge pile of trash but this one takes the cake. There's not much to talk about this garbage. It is completely immoral and trash with barely a story. There is not even a single charming moment. It's like watching slumdogs getting involved in daily hanky-panky. Kajal Arefin Rumi is the king of garbage directors. There are still great contents being made but these types of subliminal contents is targeted for the generation who don't have a drop of education and civil manner in them.",1.0,dark_spirit_1408,2024-07-08,0.0,2.0

I also have 2 House of Blues handbills of her performances, again, not because I went, but because New Orleans is teeny and back in the day those handbills were plentiful to abscond away with. Moving on! The documentary! The director makes superb use of archival pieces to feather in Ani's narrative to present day cuts with new work and growing family. Some things I knew, a lot I did not. But endless respect for her journey, talent, fearlessness, and as is revealed, vulnerability. She just seems like a very likable person who undoubtedly deserves even more credit for storied career, maybe even a statue in New Orleans somewhere, or hell, even a postal stamp (see another New Orleanian Michael Deas for that one).

1022149,No summary,"This film, which initially appears to be a typical drama centered on high-level corruption, is presented in a unique manner, particularly through the casting of comedian Xiao Yang (Li Nanbei) in the lead role of a complex police officer. His performance was commendable. While I appreciated the acting, the film nearly lost my interest at the outset due to its narrative surrounding COVID brainwashing. It seems that Guo Shubo, a television director from Changchun better known by his pen name Wubai (""Five Hundred""), may have been compelled to adhere to official party directives that suggest a new ""virus scam"" targeting China. Despite this controversial element, the film stands out as a strong piece; however, its box office earnings of 192 million yuan did not leave a significant mark upon its release in Mainland China, possibly because audiences perceived it as merely another conventional anti-corruption commentary. The film is certainly worth viewing for its impressive cinematography and performances.",7.0,panta-4,2024-08-30,0.0,0.0

Something is constantly happening at a rushed pace, yet the screenplay is a crashing bore as it is possible to connect with the tonnes and tonnes of situations and characters the film involves. After it is revealed that Sathyaraj is the superhuman in the interval, the flow worsens and behaves like a spoof material as many tend to be serious plot-points land as jokes. A couple of decent twists towards the end, but since they came out of nowhere, there is no shock value. Also, how the film utilized the twists is again crappy.

I won't list them here, there are so many and unbelievable that they are still alive approaching a hundred years old.What frightens me is that the likes of Putin, Biden/Trump, Iran, China, North Korea, Israel have their fingers on the button. A handful of men with the fate of billions in their hands. We know it's insane but they don't seem to care.This should be shown to them, forced to make them see what would happen to their people and their country, not to mention themselves. Just because they might had a safe place to ride out the bombs doesn't mean they will have something to come back to.I have no sympathy for the Japanese people of that time. I understand why they attacked Pearl Harbor, they expected the US to come to the negotiating table, they didn't think they would go to all out war.To try and play the injured party, which this documentary appears to show, is awful;.

1299509,No summary,"This documentary is both shocking and heart breaking at the same time. The events which ended WW2 the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were just the beginning of events which continue to this day and will do so long after I am gone from this earth.I sometimes wonder if Truman had invited Hirohito to the USA to witness the test of the atomic bomb and said "" I think you should surrender before this is used in a war capacity against your citizens "" whether Hirohito would have gone back to his people and surrendered to avoid such a catastophic loss of life.The Japanese people who suffered after the bombings and continue to suffer to this day MUST be a warning to the world about the power these weapons have to destroy mankind. I also think that Oppenheimer realised what he had done by allowing this to be created. For he had become the destroyer of worlds. His words taken from the scriptures were indeed true.Sadly Hirohito was proclaimed as a god by the Japanese people and I have no doubt that his ego and position would not have allowed him to show a form of weakness and vulnerability to his people. At such a high cost.Yet man continues to meddle with nuclear power like he knows what he's doing and disasters like Chernobyl and Fukushima are evidence that we simply don't know what we are doing. The documentary has left me with questions and thoughts and worries for the future of mankind. Ultimately the people who survived the bombings are the only people with first hand knowledge of the pain and suffering that has been created.It is an amazing documentary which gives the truth about the events after the bombings.

1299509,No summary,"An interesting and important film recently made available by the BBC, the film tries to put the voices of the Japanese at the centre of it rather than telling it through an allied perspective as we often get. The archive footage contrasts sharply with the modern footage. No real attempt is made to analyse how the bombings contributed to ending the war or what other options there might have been for Truman. Very little mention is made either of the appalling facist system, whatever else this was not a random act of aggrression on a humane and enlightened society which you may forget watching the film. It remains true though that it really is so often the civilians who suffer most terribly in war. The film does not really highlight either the accepted use of ""strategic bombing"" by all sides during WWII, might survivors of the Tokyo Firestorms have some equally compelling testimony you wonder?The accounts and some of the photographs make for horrifying viewing, it's really in the detail of the accounts that we discover the true horror which also extends to some of the girls who survived tending to the injured or made to help with the mass cremations. The film moves us forward in time dealing with the lives of those who survived rather than with the rebuilding of the city. The lesser known part at the end tells us about the discrimination and hardship faced by these survivors often at the hands of thrir osn government and people, as well as hearing about the effects the radiation had on their chances for marriage and children. Many of these survivors seem remarkably calm and without anger you do notice, perhaps age helps to soften things..... most of the survivors were children or teenagers when the bombings took place. One account by a survivor just 3 at the time can't really be taken as a first hand account, others may struggle to recall some details now of events from so long ago.In summary the film achieves its purpose as a haunting account of the survivors, it does not really examine though the causes of it all. No historians feature either. In using first hand eye witness testimony though, albeit with much passage of time, it does relay some powerful accounts. An anti nuclear message also is not so subtly raised at points towards the end too, with a final address to the UN.",7.0,LW-08854,2024-08-01,6.0,2.0

Despite my reservations, the buzz and trailer for this film seemed promising.The premiere itself was a glamorous red carpet event, teeming with excitement. With an impressive turnout of around 400 guests, the atmosphere hinted that this might be more than just another retelling of a familiar legend. Director Arish Sirkissoon (also known as Lx Seth) made a dramatic entrance with pyrotechnics, setting the stage for an extraordinary experience.The film exceeded all expectations. Sirkissoon, who directed, wrote, and produced the film, delivered a masterpiece that seamlessly blends thriller elements with humor and deep emotional resonance. The audience was visibly moved, with many brought to tears by the poignant script, especially those who have experienced loss.The cast was exceptional. Caitlyn Naicker (Santoni Patel) portrayed grief with such intensity that it felt palpable. Shoreek Sheoratan (Rajesh Sindu) was convincingly antagonistic, evoking strong emotions. Raksha Singh (Asha Patel), in her first major film role, brought a veteran's grace to her performance, capturing the profound sorrow of loss. Mike Narsey (Prashant Patel), playing a guilt-ridden father, balanced humor and pathos, providing much-needed comic relief in tense moments.Veteran actress Usha Khan, who plays the grandmother, will leave you in tears. Her performance, as expected, is one for the history books.Sirkissoon, along with producers Edwin Cole and Amishka Dookie, crafted a well-rounded film that offers closure and a sense of completeness by the end. Despite its two-and-a-half-hour runtime, the film remains engaging throughout.As an independent production, this film showcases Sirkissoon's immense talent and potential. His upcoming Rajbansi documentary is eagerly anticipated.""Highway Sheila: Resurrection"" is a brilliant film, with stellar performances by the cast and crew. The premiere, graced by Mr. Vivian Reddy's opening speech, hinted at its cinematic excellence.Catch ""Highway Sheila: Resurrection"" in 23 cinemas nationwide (Ster Kinekor, Nu Metro, and Cinecentre) starting June 14, 2024.Rating: 9/10.",10.0,ArishSirkissoon,2024-06-22,1.0,2.0

1159367,No summary,"""Love in the Time of Corona""**Director Shwan Attoof's latest film, ""Love in the Time of Corona,"" has sparked disappointment and frustration among viewers, and for good reason. Despite the director's esteemed background, this film falls egregiously short on multiple fronts.From the outset, the storyline flounders aimlessly, offering little substance or coherence. It's evident that the narrative lacks a compelling plot, leaving audiences bewildered and disconnected throughout. The attempt to intertwine themes of love and the pandemic feels forced and superficial, failing to resonate with any depth or authenticity.The performances, notably by acclaimed Kurdish actors Mahir Hassan and Ahmed Jola, are disappointingly lackluster. Their talents are wasted on poorly developed characters who fail to evoke any emotional investment from the audience. One can't help but wonder why such esteemed actors would lend their names to roles so poorly written and executed.Technical aspects of the film also suffer, with glaring issues in pacing and cinematography that further detract from its already feeble attempts at storytelling. Scenes drag on without purpose, and the visual composition fails to capture even a fraction of the intended mood or atmosphere.""Love in the Time of Corona"" not only fails as a cinematic experience but also raises concerns about the future of Kurdish cinema. Such lackluster productions risk undermining the credibility and potential success of Kurdish filmmaking on a broader stage.In conclusion, ""Love in the Time of Corona"" is a regrettable misfire that falls short of expectations on every level. With a disjointed plot, uninspired performances, and technical shortcomings, this film is best avoided by discerning viewers seeking meaningful storytelling and quality filmmaking.Rating: 1/10 stars.",1.0,karwan04,2024-06-21,2.0,0.0

I went into this movie with high hopes and expectations, but unfortunately, it turned out to be an utter disappointment. The story lacked depth, and the comedy was poorly executed. The side characters, who could have added much-needed dynamism, failed to deliver compelling performances. Although the film attempts to portray the reality of youth, this portrayal could have been achieved with a much better script.The script itself felt subpar and poorly constructed. None of the songs were memorable, except for the ending track, which seemed to be the primary draw for many viewers. This was disappointing, as a strong soundtrack can often redeem a movie with other shortcomings. Additionally, the film contains several scenes that are inappropriate for viewing with family or children, which limits its audience appeal. The excessive use of slang also detracted from the overall experience, making it feel forced and unnecessary.While the film had potential and a few redeeming qualities, they were not enough to make up for its numerous flaws. The reality of youth is a compelling theme, but it requires a well-thought-out script and strong performances to be effective. Unfortunately, this movie did not deliver on either front.In conclusion, the movie falls short in many ways. The story, comedy, and character performances were all lacking, and the script was substandard. Even the soundtrack, which can often elevate a film, was forgettable. Due to these shortcomings, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It felt like a waste of time and money, and I left the theater feeling disappointed. There are far better options available that provide both entertainment and quality storytelling.",1.0,pbrandomhouse,2024-06-12,5.0,0.0

Serial Beauty is about two cops trying to track down a killer who's turning his victims into mannequins and works of art. Yes, you have to overlook a few things, and the cinematography at times is a little inconsistent, but I really enjoyed this film, mostly because of the dry humor.Serial Beauty also succeeds because the acting is really good; the cast all seem to be on the same page. I thought the character Vadim the mortician, played by Tihomir Dukic, did a really good job. He's a little over the top, but I like that he made that choice. He's super creepy and fixated on the beauty of these dead women, which is unnerving and plays into the world writer and director Sigal Erez created. I don't think this film is for everyone, and again, that's why I like it even more. I don't mind the rough edges. I can see what Sigal is doing, and I enjoyed it.

1360612,No summary,"Living in a small town, a group of high-school teens preparing for their homecoming celebrations finds the whole thing interrupted by a series of strange deaths throughout the community, and after realizing that the killer is a figure from the past looking to settle scores must stop him.This was a better-than-expected if still somewhat flawed indie slasher. One of the better factors about this one is the strong sense of mystery built up with the storyline throughout here. With a fine motivation backstory about the potential killer being a bullied kid at school who finally snapped and went crazy, the time jump instead to the current day involving the series of strange deaths affecting the older crop of students that were bullying the strange kid sets this one up quite nicely. Focusing on the idea of the bullies getting their comeuppance while still trying to deal with the strange details that emerge involving how everyone gets interconnected with each other throughout the years, the mystery about what's going on is handled pretty well with the whole thing taking quite a few decent turns for its decent storyline. As this also features some decent slasher film attributes in a fine mask and some violent deaths even though they're not on-screen, these are enough for a solid enough series of positives. There are a few issues with this one that bring it down. Among its biggest drawbacks is the fact that it spends so much time trying to establish the necessary groundwork for the killer's motivations that it drags itself out far longer than needed. Rather than focus on the generalities of what's going on, the idea of spelling out how terrible his homelife is with his verbally abusive mother, being bullied at school, and not having any kind of friend to turn to before snapping is all dredged up to the point that it feels like overkill about his life before getting to the point. It's not needed to go this deep on the kind of simple-minded revenge setup when the standards and conventions of the genre mean that hitting the bullet points of everything and getting to the main storyline can be quite effective which is what's missing here. That carries over into the rest of the film as the investigation angle leaves this with quite a few large periods with no stalking or action as the majority of the kills are weakly executed without much stalking or on-screen gore, all of which lower this one overall.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Language and Graphic Violence.",4.0,kannibalcorpsegrinder,2024-10-11,1.0,0.0

Bajrang knows Azaan whereas Ali knows Hanuman Chalisa, which portrays how deep their bond is. A trouble comes trying to separate them.Good parts - Songs are beautiful. Some of the dialogues are also very nice, which deepens the friendship between the religions.Improvement areas - Acting was weak, especially of the side characters. There was a scene just a few minutes before the interval where an actor seemingly speaks a wrong dialogue and it is not removed. The story was also a bit weak. It only catches pace in the second half.Overall, it is a one time watch.

837806,No summary,"An Australian skateboarding documentary with a broad global appeal, Skategoat is one of the year's most memorable local offerings that examines the life and times of social media skating sensation Leandre ""Skategoat"" Sanders.For his debut feature length film, director Van Alpert has struck gold by collating years worth of footage he and partners shot over more than a decade as a chance encounter with Sanders and his fellow skateboarding enthusiasts and ""lost boys"" including long-term off-sider Haden Mckenna allowed for Skategoat to come together as not only an intriguing look at the makings of Sanders but also the misunderstood skateboarding and broader scene of Venice Beach.Making it's mark recently at Australian film festival's in Sydney and Melbourne, Skategoat isn't an overly focussed or narratively minded expose but Alpert and his creative team (which includes producer participation from Gwyneth Paltrow) ensure that this quickfire 84 minute doco is consistently engaging as both Sanders and the broader skateboarding world make for interesting main characters along with some stunning and memorable action in the bowls and streets Sanders frequents across his journey in the 4-wheeled world.Joining the likes of skateboard themed heavy hitting doco's such as Dogtown and the Z Boys and All This Mayhem, Skategoat is a fascinating look into the culture of the skating world that many would have very little idea about and while a more narrowed in focus may have benefited Alpert's film on an emotional or storytelling level, there's still a lot to take away from the story of Sanders as the boy turned man escaped a world of gangs and drugs to turn his attention to making something of his skateboarding skillset.With close to 360,000 followers on his Instagram profile at the time of viewing, it's not hard to see why so many fans from around the world have tuned in to follow Sanders unique and colourful journey in the skateboarding scene and getting too witness him and Mckenna explore their abilities and traverse the beautiful but unforgiving and foreboding Venice Beach area as teenagers who should be guided by adult influencers is an eye-opening one with the boys and Alpert capturing some of the years most memorable imagery on their journey together.From the drug-addled skid-row streets, the sunlit skate bowls through to the busy sidewalks and alleyways of one of the most well-known locations in the world, Skategoat offers up a fantastic chance for viewers to become a fly on the wall to a whole other universe and one that helped mould and shape the charismatic Sanders into the man he is today, a man who has never shied away from a challenge and beat the expectations placed on him from the moment he entered the world.Final Say -While offering no grand insights or statements, Australian backed doco Skategoat is an impressive debut from director Van Alpert and a must-see for any skating fans or those seeking a warts and all exploration of the Venice Beach surrounds.3 1/2 American Gangster t-shirts out of 5Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",7.0,eddie_baggins,2024-10-13,1.0,0.0

1068211,No summary,"The opening scene is probably my favorite part of the whole movie. It's shot at night and involves a tense conversation between a man and a woman in a car. At this point, we know nothing about any of the characters, so this introduction makes us wonder who these people are and what they are doing. The first thing I noticed was the way the dialogue was structured. I felt that the conversation was done well with the characters having time to show who they were. This was consistent throughout the movie with lots of time allowed for meaningful conversations. Malcolm (Luke Robinson) delivered his dialogue effectively and was giving me Samuel L. Jackson vibes. Christine (Lindsay Smith) was present because her boss told her to pick Malcolm up and deliver him to an address, but there are hints that there is more to her than we first imagine. The score was very effective in this scene and added to the mood.The movie synopsis mentions mob boss Jimmy Marconi (Michael Maloley), and while it's clear he is the overall motivating force for the story, I feel that Christine drove the events that we see unfold on the screen. Lindsay Smith does a great job with the character, making her seem strong and confident in her own abilities. She delivers a lot of her lines in an offhand way that often distracts the people that she is interacting with, but we know more about who she really is deep down inside. One of the best scenes in the movie involved an interaction between Jimmy and Chief Wilson (Timothy Paul McCarthy). I would have liked more scenes with Chief Wilson. It's difficult to talk about the plot without revealing spoilers.There is quite a bit of violence in the movie, although the worst of that seems to happen off screen with the sounds of what might be happening shaping our thoughts about Jimmy and others. One scene threatened to enter horror territory, but it was done with dark humor. The character involved ended up as a key player and establishes that he isn't completely in touch with reality and might be capable of irrational acts.As we have learned from countless stories, if you steal from a crime lord, there will be consequences. The movie has elements of something such as No Country for Old Men, with multiple characters chasing missing money. Are they doing it for their employer or for their personal gain? Don't get too attached to any of the characters because this is a world in which nobody is safe and anyone could have hidden motives. There are a few twists and turns, and one earned gasps from the audience as the majority did not see it coming. I'm always happy to be surprised by a plot twist and I am not fond of predicting the ending after 10 minutes of the movie. There are no such problems here.Like the opening chapter, the final chapter in the story was also shot in the dark. The Q&A revealed that this was one of the biggest challenges of the movie. It was shot at night over the course of about a week, with filming beginning at sunset and going through the night. The result is an effective climax to the story, and the motivations of the main characters all make sense in the end. The story was all shot in Ontario, with Toronto and the Durham region featuring strongly.One thing that was handled particularly well is the relationships between the characters. Christine has strong ties to Jimmy and Ray (Robert Nolan). I also liked the development of Kate's character (Lindura), and the chemistry she had with her son Jacob (Taytum Douglas). Some of the relationships end up causing conflict and help shape the final act of the movie.I saw some references to Quentin Tarantino. The story was split into chapters, and as with Kill Bill we see a strong female lead. The tension in the stretched out dialogue also reminded me of Tarantino, and there was even a shot from inside the open trunk of a car and a phrase that I remember from a Samuel L. Jackson character. That said, this was not a Tarantino pastiche, but it does have these few things in common.The casting was generally excellent, and the performances didn't disappoint. I had the opportunity to briefly talk with some of the cast and Michael Maloley was still in character! I'm interested to see a lot of the cast members in other roles. Incidentally, you'll enjoy this movie more if you are a fan of classic cars as they appear often.If I were to name one thing that would have made the movie even better from my perspective, it would be to delve deeper into the backstories of the main characters. Going back to Kill Bill for a moment, we root for the Bride because we know how she has been treated. It feels like justice when she has the showdown with Bill. In Dangerous Rumors, I feel like we could have been even more invested in Christine if we knew more about her motivations. Joe's motivations were also left as a bit of a mystery, but he is an important part of the story and helps shape Christine's actions. This may just be personal preference, but I'm the type of guy who prefers Daniel Craig's Bond because we know why he does everything.",,aldersleysteven,2024-06-22,1.0,1.0

1276005,No summary,"Those in the minority - no matter what the defining trait associated with that might be - often find comfort, support and camaraderie in the company of kindred spirits when surrounded by others who don't share this commonality. For African-American students at Yale University in the 1990s, this could be found at ""the Black Table,"" a gathering spot for those similarly situated within Commons, the university's legendary cavernous dining hall, a venue resembling a setting out of the ""Harry Potter"" movies. The Black Table served as an oasis for students of color in the midst of a predominantly White (and not always particularly tolerant) student body, a place where they could share ideas, swap stories, engage in discussions (sometimes heated) and find common ground. The experiences of students who availed themselves of this era's version of a social network thus provide the basis for this documentary from writer-directors John Antonio James and Billy Mack. The film examines what the students gained from their interactions with one another and how they collectively faced the sometimes-challenging conditions that prevailed on campus and in society at large at the time. It also serves as a springboard for explorations of an array of other subjects, such as the impact of affirmative action on minority admissions (a controversial program that was undergoing change at the time) and how their tenure at Yale prepared them for life after college. However, ""Black Table"" works best when it focuses on the aspects associated with its core premise, its offshoot tangents frequently getting somewhat off-track and acting more like filler. And, because of that, the end result here inevitably reveals that there may not have been enough material in the first place to build a full feature film around it. Indeed, this release likely would have made a better extended short or episode of a PBS series. The alumni's time at the Black Table obviously meant much to them, but those experiences would have made for a better film with greater depth and attention focused on them than what this release ultimately offers.",6.0,brentsbulletinboard,2024-11-21,0.0,0.0

1293150,No summary,"""A Place Between"" is like no other movie. Taking home movies from various families that were offered for sale on the internet, Chris Peters has woven them together to create an emotional journey into American family life in the fifties and sixties. He's overlaid a storyline roughly based on Dante's Purgatorio wherein a lost soul searches for his identity through what seems like the Bardo, the place between life and death. He eventually discovers who he was and who he loved in his time on the planet. The editing is excellent and the voice over actors, including Samantha Sloyan and Guy Kent, are compelling and believable. What involved me was the dream-like quality of seeing the world through the eyes of someone who can roam through realities and take it all in without being able to participate. That becomes a metaphor for the experience of all movie lovers. ""The Place Between"" allows us to appreciate both the beauty and the ephemeral nature of being alive.

American retiree Dan Fine initially went to Ukraine to help the animals, with some assistance and direction provided by Humane Society International as well as White Angels. Fine was making short videos to document the exploding tragedy to those back home. He became convinced by a filmmaker that he had the pieces of a documentary, which, when completed, became War Tails. But you can be certain that making a film was completely secondary to Fine's purpose.In the U. S., rabies is a fatal viral disease that is contained by vaccinating your pets. In Ukraine, rabies has begun running rampant because of the number of animals abandoned by war. In addition, the vets there simply can't keep up with the overpopulation of dogs and cats. In order to completely contain the virus and birth rates, more than 500,000 must be vaccinated and sterilized in the next four years.Fine journeys throughout multiple devastated Ukranian cities with Krystyna, a Ukranian citizen and an absolutely fearless woman, trying to help these victims. You're mistaken if you believe their mission is just about animals. Rabies can be communicated to humans, with the infected dying a horrible, painful death, so this involves more than helping abandoned dogs and cats.Dan and Krystyna catch and contain the petrified animals and bring them in to makeshift clinics, where they are treated by veterinarians. Their goal is to vaccinate a few thousand animals in multiple cities. Krystyna crawls into cement ducts, goes into abandoned, mine-ridden fields and had been bitten on multiple occassions, yet she and Dan persist with their mission. You'd think War Tails was going to be tragic in light of the situation, yet it was ultimately very positive and will resonate with anyone who ever loved an animal.And if you're interested in helping be part of the solution, contact the E.

1265445,No summary,"This was a short film that I got the chance to see thanks to one of its stars, Timothy J. Cox. A press release and screener link were sent over. Now I have done a bit of digging and found out that this isn't horror. It did have dark subject matter and since I like to support independent works, I decided to watch this for review.Synopsis: a determined journalist makes a startling discovery when he's visited by an unexpected stranger.This takes place in a small bar in Ohio. Meekah (Theo White) orders two shots and then takes a seat in a booth. What we'll learn later is that he's a journalist, also from the synopsis. His search for the truth leaves him without many relationships in life. He's looking at crime scene photographs. That is when he's joined by a mysterious stranger, played by Cox. This person speaks cryptically, but what he says shakes Meekah to the core.Since this is a short that runs six and a half minutes, that should be enough without going into spoilers. I'll be honest, I'm not fully sure I understand what or who this mysterious stranger was. I think that is open to interpretation. I'll preface here that for short films, I tend to judge them if they tell a complete story or if they more to tell. I think that this could be fleshed out into more and that is something that I'd be interested in.This is a two person show for the majority. We have Meekah who we learn is obsessed with his work and his current fascination are these cold cases that the police can't seem to find any evidence on. The title plays into this in an interesting way. Meekah has lost relationships with his family and significant others since he gets sucked into finding the truth, like with this story. There was another part of me wondering if he did these killings. White was spot on with his performance here.Then there's the other character, our mysterious stranger. He joins Meekah in his booth and talks about how he observes people. He believes that people fall into three categories and this stranger believes that he can make that determination in just a few seconds of seeing someone. I'm not sure he was representing death, a demon or what, but Cox was great in performance. There is a calming tone to his voice while also being creepy. It works well.I'll then finish out with filmmaking. I'll start by saying that the rest of the cast worked to make this bar feel real. It is one, but it feels like places I've been to which adds realism. The cinematography was good as was the framing. There is an intimate feel which fits that this is mostly a two person show. I'd also say that crime scene photographs were a good touch. The soundtrack also fit what was needed in building the atmosphere.In conclusion, this is one that I'd recommend. If you like an atmospheric short that has solid acting, then I think this would be for you. Personally, I'd like to see this story fleshed out more. I'm not going to hold that against what we get here though either. White and Cox were great in their interactions. This is also well made from the framing to the cinematography. The press release said this was doing its festival rounds now but keep your eye open for this where you watch short films.My Rating: 7 out of 10.",7.0,Reviews_of_the_Dead,2024-07-21,1.0,0.0
